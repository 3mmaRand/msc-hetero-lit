At present, researchers usually gain high-purity CSCs through flow cytometry sorting and expand them by short-term sphere culture. However, it is still uncertain whether we can amplify high-purity CSCs through long-term sphere culture. We have proposed a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to derive the continuous variation of the CSC ratio in long-term sphere culture and estimated the model parameters based on a long-term sphere culture of MCF-7 stem cells. We found that the CSC ratio in long-term sphere culture presented as gradually decreased drift and might be stable at a lower level. Furthermore, we found that fitted model parameters could explain the main growth pattern of CSCs and differentiated cancer cells in long-term sphere culture.																	1932-6203					NOV 16	2011	6	11							e25518	10.1371/journal.pone.0025518							WOS:000297555400005	22110580

However, the role of ANXA3 in breast cancer is still unclear. Here, we observed that the expression level of ANXA3 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues. ANXA3 knockdown inhibited cell invasion but promoted cell proliferation in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, we found that ANXA3 knockdown inhibited the NF kappa B pathway via upregulating I kappa B alpha, resulting in mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and a heterogeneity change of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). In addition, we demonstrated that ANXA3 knockdown increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin by increasing the drug uptake. The combination of ANXA3 knockdown and doxorubicin treatment simultaneously inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. This study described the role and mechanisms of ANXA3 in regulating BCSCs and breast cancer growth and metastasis, indicating that downregulating ANXA3 together with chemotherapy might be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer.				liu, suling/AAF-5249-2019; Liu, Suling/N-2796-2013; Zhou, Lei/B-9155-2014	liu, suling/0000-0002-0475-0242; Liu, Suling/0000-0002-0475-0242; Zhou, Lei/0000-0003-0417-1168												2041-4889					JAN 26	2018	9								126	10.1038/s41419-017-0143-z							WOS:000427388100005	29374148

Creating environments conducive to tissue repair, the haemoderivatives are commonly proposed for the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds. Here, we explored in vitro the intrinsic regenerative potentialities of a leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin product, known as CPL-MB, defining the stemness grade of cells sprouting from the haemoderivative. Using highly concentrated serum-based medium to simulate wound conditions, we isolated fibroblast-like cells (CPL-CMCs) adhering to plastic and showing stable in vitro propagation, heterogeneous stem cell expression pattern, endothelial adhesive properties and immunomodulatory profile. Due to their blood derivation and expression of CXCR4, CPL-CMCs have been suggested to be immature cells circulating in peripheral blood at quiescent state until activation by both coagulation event and inflammatory stimuli such as stromal-derived factor 1/SDF1. Expressing integrins (CD49f, CD103), vascular adhesion molecules (CD106, CD166), endoglin (CD105) and remodelling matrix enzymes (MMP2, MMP9, MMP13), they showed a transendothelial migratory potential besides multipotency. Taken together, our data suggested that a standardized, reliable and economically feasible blood product such as CPL-MB functions as an artificial stem cell niche that, under permissive conditions, originate ex vivo immature cells that could be useful for autologous stem cell-based therapies.

However, alterations in gene expression and microRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for the regulation of cell fate determination and may be evolved in OI phenotype. Methods: In this work, we analyzed the coding region and intron/exon boundaries of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes by sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 3130 automated sequencer and Big Dye Terminator Sequencing protocol. COL1A1 and miR-29b expression were also evaluated during the osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) by qRT-PCR using an ABI7500 Sequence Detection System. Results: We have identified eight novel mutations, where of four may be responsible for OI phenotype. COL1A1 and miR-29b showed lower expression values in OI type I and type III samples. Interestingly, one type III OI sample from a patient with Bruck Syndrome showed COL1A1 and miR-29b expressions alike those from normal samples. Conclusions: Results suggest that the miR-29b mechanism directed to regulate collagen protein accumulation during mineralization is dependent upon the amount of COL1A1 mRNA. Taken together, results indicate that the lower levels observed in OI samples were not sufficient for the induction of miR-29b.

J	Briede, I; Strumfa, I; Vanags, A; Gardovskis, J				Briede, Inese; Strumfa, Ilze; Vanags, Andrejs; Gardovskis, Janis			The Association Between Inflammation, Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition and Stemness in Colorectal Carcinoma	JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION RESEARCH												Background: Inflammation plays an important albeit dual role in carcinogenesis. Survival studies have highlighted the prognostic significance of peritumorous inflammation. Currently, the theoretical background allows inflammation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the closely associated stem cell differentiation in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to be linked. However, there is scarce direct morphological evidence. Purpose and methods: The aim of our study was to investigate the role of inflammation in cancer growth and invasion by analyzing the association between inflammation and known morphological prognostic features of colorectal cancer, EMT, stemness and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression. The study was designed as a retrospective morphological and immunohistochemical assessment of 553 consecutive cases of surgically treated primary CRC. Results: There were statistically significant associations between high-grade inflammation and lower pT (p = 0.002), absence of lymph node metastases (p < 0.001) and less frequent lymphatic (p = 0.003), venous (p = 0.017), arterial (p = 0.012), perineural (p = 0.001) and intraneural (p = 0.01) invasion. In contrast, Crohn's like reaction (CLR) by density of lymphoid follicles in the invasive front lacked significant differences in regard to pT, pN, tumor invasion into surrounding structures (blood or lymphatic vessels, nerves), grade or necrosis (all p > 0.05). The expression of E-cadherin, CD44 and MMR proteins yielded no statistically significant associations with peritumorous inflammation by Klintrup-Makinen score or the density of lymphoid follicles. Nevertheless, E-cadherin levels were significantly associated with the density of eosinophils (p = 0.007). Conclusion: High-grade peritumorous inflammation is associated with beneficial morphologic CRC features, including less frequent manifestations of invasion, and is not secondary to tissue damage and necrosis. CLR is not associated with cancer spread by pTN; this finding indirectly suggests an independent role of CLR in carcinogenesis. Further, inflammation by Klintrup-Makinen grade and CLR is not dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell differentiation. Our study highlights the complex associations between inflammation, tumor morphology, EMT, stemness and MMR protein expression in human CRC tissues.

Dental follicle cells (DFCs), acknowledged as the precursor cells of PDLCs, have demonstrated stemness, embryonic features, heterogeneity, and pluripotency. Therefore, we hypothesized that DFC sheets might be more effective and suitable for periodontal tissue regeneration than PDLC sheets. In this study, we compared the biological characteristics of DFC sheets and PDLC sheets in vitro. To investigate the potential for periodontal tissue regeneration in vivo, complexes composed of two types of cell sheets combined with dentin matrix were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice for 6 weeks. Our results showed that, when forming cell sheets, DFCs secreted richer extracellular matrix than PDLCs. And compared to DFCs, DFC sheets expressed high levels of calcification-related genes, including alkaline phosphatase (alp), bone sialoprotein (bsp), osteopontin (opn), runt-related transcription factor (runx2), as well as the periodontal ligament-specific genes collagen III (col III) and periostin, while the gene expression of bsp, osteocalcin (ocn), and opn were greatly increased in PDLC sheets, when compared to PDLCs. col I expression did not change significantly. However, cementum protein 23 (cp-23) expression increased several fold in PDLC sheets compared to PDLCs but decreased in DFC sheets compared to DFCs. DFC and PDLC sheets were both positive for Collagen I (Col I), cementum attachment protein (CAP), ALP, BSP, OCN, and OPN protein expression, and Col I, ALP, BSP, and OPN expression were increased after cell sheets were formed. Furthermore, the levels of laminin and fibronectin were higher in DFCs and DFC sheets than that of PDLCs and PDLC sheets, respectively. In vivo, DFC and PDLC sheets could both regenerate periodontal tissue-like structures, but DFC sheets demonstrated stronger periodontal regeneration potential than PDLC sheets. Therefore, DFC sheets derived from discarded dental follicle tissue after tooth extraction may be more advantageous for clinical periodontal tissue regeneration in the future.

One of the models that best explains the heterogeneity observed in CNS tumors is the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this paper, we evaluated platinum-based response in brain tumor U-87 MG, LN-18, and KELLY cell lines cultured in monolayer (2D) and neurosphere (CSC enrichment- 3D) models. We evaluated mRNA expression of heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSPB1, HSPA1AL, TRAP1, and HSPD1), and DNA repair gene ERCC1. Changes in cell cycle and glycosylation profile were assessed by flow cytometry. After treatment with cisplatin, we found that the mRNA expression of HSPs markedly increased in the U-87 MG and LN-18 neurosphere cells. In KELLY monolayer cells, cisplatin induced upregulation of all genes. In KELLY neurosphere cells, only the HSPA1A, HSPB1, TRAP1, and HSPD1 genes were upregulated. The proportion of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase was significantly higher in U-87 MG neurosphere cisplatin-treated cells. A trend towards a greater proportion of cells in the S phase of U-87 MG monolayer cisplatin-treated cells was also observed. On the other hand, a significant decrease in the number of cells in the S phase and an increase in G(2)/M was observed in LN-18 monolayer cisplatin-treated cells. Glycosylation analysis using lectins showed a higher surface binding for PNA in the U-87 MG treated monolayer and a lower binding for Concanavalin A in the treated neurospheres. The binding of Isolectin GS-IB4, GSII, and SBA in KELLY monolayer cisplatin-treated cells was lower whereas the proportion of cells labeled with Concanavalin A was higher. In the KELLY neurosphere cisplatin-treated cells, the binding of Concanavalin A was lower than nontreated cells. Thus, our findings strongly supported the idea that definitions of phenotypic characteristics may help to establish better therapeutic strategies for brain tumors.				Fialho, S.

Here, we assessed the BM microenvironment of AML patients and demonstrate that the leukemia stem cells induce a change in the transcriptional programming of the normal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The modified leukemic niche alters the expressions of cross-talk molecules (i.e., CXCL12 and JAG1) in MSCs to provide a distinct cross-talk between normal and leukemia cells, selectively suppressing normal primitive hemato-poietic cells while supporting leukemogenesis and chemoresistance. Of note, AML patients exhibited distinct heterogeneity in the alteration of mesenchymal stroma in BM. The distinct pattern of stromal changes in leukemic BM at initial diagnosis was associated with a heterogeneous posttreatment clinical course with respect to the maintenance of complete remission for 5 to 8 years and early or late relapse. Thus, remodeling of mesenchymal niche by leukemia cells is an intrinsic self-reinforcing process of leukemogenesis that can be a parameter for the heterogeneity in the clinical course of leukemia and hence serve as a potential prognostic factor.

Confocal Images of Circulating Tumor Cells Obtained Using a Methodology and Technology That Removes Normal Cells	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS					NanoMedicine Summit on Nanoparticles for Imaging, Diagnosis and Therapeutics	SEP 25-26, 2008-2009	Cleveland, OH	Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland Clinic				A completely negative enrichment technology was used to detect circulating tumor cells, CTCs, in the peripheral blood of head and neck cancer patients. Of 32 blood samples, 63% contained CTCs and the number of CTCs identified per mL of blood collected ranged from 0 to 214. The final purity ranged from 1 CTC in 9 total cells to 1 CTC in 20,000 total cells, the final purity being both a function of the number of CTCs and the performance of the specific enrichment. Consistent with previous reports, CTC were positively identified if: (1) they contained a nucleus based on DAPI stain, (2) stained positive for cytokeratins, and (3) have a high nuclei to cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, for a blood sample to be considered positive for CTCs, the enriched sample must be positive for epithelial growth factor receptor, EGFR, as measured by RT-PCR. While most of the blood samples were obtained during surgery, a number were taken prior to and during surgery, In all of the pre- and postsurgery paired samples, significant numbers of CTCs were detected. A number of these enriched samples were observed under confocal microscope in addition to the microscopic observations under traditional wide-field fluorescent microscope. As expected, the FITC stained cytokeratins appeared in the cytoplasm and the average size of these positively stained cells, on the cytospin, was in the range of 8-12 mu m. Future studies will involve the investigation if cancer stem cell and mesenchymal markers are present on these CTCs and correlations of patient outcome to the number and type of CTC present.

Examining cell-to-cell heterogeneity, and further, identifying subpopulations of cells based on scRNA seq data has been of common interest in life science research. A key component to successfully identifying cell subpopulations (or clustering cells) is the (dis)similarity measure used to group the cells. In this paper, we introduce a novel measure, named SIDEseq, to assess cell-to-cell similarity using scRNA seq data. SIDEseq first identifies a list of putative differentially expressed (DE) genes for each pair of cells. SIDEseq then integrates the information from all the DE gene lists (corresponding to all pairs of cells) to build a similarity measure between two cells. SIDEseq can be implemented in any clustering algorithm that requires a (dis)similarity matrix. This new measure incorporates information from all cells when evaluating the similarity between any two cells, a characteristic not commonly found in existing (dis)similarity measures. This property is advantageous for two reasons: (a) borrowing information from cells of different subpopulations allows for the investigation of pairwise cell relationships from a global perspective and (b) information from other cells of the same subpopulation could help to ensure a robust relationship assessment. We applied SIDEseq to a newly generated human ovarian cancer scRNA seq dataset, a public human embryo scRNA seq dataset, and several simulated datasets. The clustering results suggest that the SIDEseq measure is capable of uncovering important relationships between cells, and outperforms or at least does as well as several popular (dis)similarity measures when used on these datasets.																	1867-1764	1867-1772				JUN	2017	9	1					200	216		10.1007/s12561-017-9194-z							WOS:000405697000011	30774736

The Radiation Resistance of Human Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Is Independent of Their Tissue of Origin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS												Purpose: Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may aid the regeneration of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tissue damage. They can be harvested from different tissues for clinical purposes; however, the role of the tissue source on the radiation response of human MSCs remains unknown. Methods and Materials: Human MSCs were isolated from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and umbilical cord, and cellular survival, proliferation, and apoptosis were measured after irradiation. The influence of IR on the defining functions of MSCs was assessed, and cell morphology, surface marker expression, and the differentiation potential were examined. Western blot analyses were performed to assess the activation of DNA damage signaling and repair pathways. Results: MSCs from adipose tissue, bone marrow, and umbilical cord exhibited a relative radioresistance independent of their tissue of origin. Defining properties including cellular adhesion and surface marker expression were preserved, and irradiated MSCs maintained their potential for multilineage differentiation irrespective of their tissue source. Analysis of activated DNA damage recognition and repair pathways demonstrated an efficient repair of IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks in MSCs from different tissues, thereby influencing the induction of apoptosis. Conclusions: These data show for the first time that MSCs are resistant to IR and largely preserve their defining functions after irradiation irrespective of their tissue of origin. Efficient repair of IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks and consecutive reduction of apoptosis induction may contribute to the tissue-independent radiation resistance of MSCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Genetic Heterogeneity in Therapy-Naive Synchronous Primary Breast Cancers and Their Metastases	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH												Purpose: Paired primary breast cancers and metachronous metastases after adjuvant treatment are reported to differ in their clonal composition and genetic alterations, but it is unclear whether these differences stem from the selective pressures of the metastatic process, the systemic therapies, or both. We sought to define the repertoire of genetic alterations in breast cancer patients with de novo metastatic disease who had not received local or systemic therapy. Experimental Design: Up to two anatomically distinct core biopsies of primary breast cancers and synchronous distant metastases from nine patients who presented with metastatic disease were subjected to high-depth whole-exome sequencing. Mutations, copy number alterations and their cancer cell fractions, and mutation signatures were defined using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods. All mutations identified were validated with orthogonal methods. Results: Genomic differences were observed between primary and metastatic deposits, with a median of 60% (range 6%-95%) of shared somatic mutations. Although mutations in known driver genes including TP53, PIK3CA, and GATA3 were preferentially clonal in both sites, primary breast cancers and their synchronous metastases displayed spatial intratumor heterogeneity. Likely pathogenic mutations affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related genes, including SMAD4, TCF7L2, and TCF4 (ITF2), were found to be restricted to or enriched in the metastatic lesions. Mutational signatures of trunk mutations differed from those of mutations enriched in the primary tumor or the metastasis in six cases. Conclusions: Synchronous primary breast cancers and metastases differ in their repertoire of somatic genetic alterations even in the absence of systemic therapy. Mutational signature shifts might contribute to spatial intratumor genetic heterogeneity. (C) 2017 AACR.

Previous studies have indicated that gastric cancer originates from cancer stem cells (CSCs), and some investigators have found that a particular subset of CSCs possesses higher metastatic capacity. However, the specific mechanism remains uncertain. In the present study, we aimed to explore the biological functions of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) in gastric cancer metastasis and the distinct IL-17-induced transformation of quiescent gastric CSCs. Our results showed that invasive gastric CSCs were CD26+ and CXCR4+ and were closely associated with increased metastatic ability. The quiescent gastric CSCs, which were CD26- and CXCR4-, were exposed to appropriate concentrations of IL-17; this resulted in the decreased expression of E-cadherin and the increased expression of vimentin and N-cadherin. In addition, the upregulation of IL-17 both in vitro and in vivo resulted in a significant induction of invasion, migration and tumor formation ability in gastric CSCs compared with the control group, which was not treated with IL-17. Further experiments indicated that the activation of the downstream phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor pathway was facilitated by IL-17. On the contrary, the downregulation of STAT3 by the specific inhibitor Stattic significantly reversed the IL-17-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated properties of quiescent gastric CSCs. Moreover, tumorigenesis and metastasis were suppressed. Taken together, we suggest that IL-17 is positively correlated with the transformation of quiescent gastric CSCs into invasive gastric CSCs and that targeting IL-17 may emerge as a possible novel therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.																	0950-9232	1476-5594				MAR	2017	36	9					1256	1264		10.1038/onc.2016.291							WOS:000395861300009	27524415

PTEN and TP53 contribute to the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation in prostate progenitors, presumptive tumor initiating cells for prostate cancer. Here we characterize the transformed phenotypes resulting from deletion of the Pten and TP53 tumor suppressors in prostate epithelium. Using the PB-Cre4(+) Pten(fl/fl) TP53(fl/fl) model of prostate cancer, we describe the histological and metastatic properties of primary tumors, transplanted primary tumor cells, and clonal cell lines established from tumors. Adenocarcinoma was the major primary tumor type that developed, which progressed to lethal sarcomatoid carcinoma at approximately 6 months of age. In addition, basal carcinomas and prostatic urothelial carcinomas were observed. We show that tumor heterogeneity resulted, at least in part, from the transformation of multipotential progenitors. CK8+ luminal epithelial cells were capable of undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition in vivo to sarcomatoid carcinomas containing osseous metaplasia. Metastasis rarely was observed from primary tumors, but metastasis to lung and lymph nodes occurred frequently from orthotopic tumors initiated from a biphenotypic clonal cell line. Androgen deprivation influenced the differentiated phenotypes of metastases. These data show that one functional consequence of Pten/TP53 loss in prostate epithelium is lineage plasticity of transformed cells.

Here, we aimed to investigate the origin and clonal dynamics of endothelial cells (ECs) associated with neovascularization in the adult mouse heart following myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, we sought to define murine cardiac endothelial heterogeneity and to characterize the transcriptional profiles of pro-angiogenic resident ECs in the adult mouse heart, at single-cell resolution. Methods and results An EC-specific multispectral lineage-tracing mouse (Pdgfb-iCreER(T2)-R26R-Brainbow2.1) was used to demonstrate that structural integrity of adult cardiac endothelium following MI was maintained through clonal proliferation by resident ECs in the infarct border region, without significant contributions from bone marrow cells or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Ten transcriptionally discrete heterogeneous EC states, as well as the pathways through which each endothelial state is likely to enhance neovasculogenesis and tissue regeneration following ischaemic injury were defined. Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (Plvap) was selected for further study, which showed an endothelial-specific and increased expression in both the ischaemic mouse and human heart, and played a direct role in regulating human endothelial proliferation in vitro. Conclusion We present a single-cell gene expression atlas of cardiac specific resident ECs, and the transcriptional hierarchy underpinning endogenous vascular repair following MI. These data provide a rich resource that could assist in the development of new therapeutic interventions to augment endogenous myocardial perfusion and enhance regeneration in the injured heart.

We characterized ZEB1 expression at single cell level in 266 primary brain tumors and present a comprehensive dataset of high grade gliomas with Ki67, p53, IDH1, and EGFR immunohistochemistry, as well as EGFR FISH. ZEB1 protein expression in glioma stem cell lines was compared to their parental tumors with respect to gene expression subtypes based on RNA-seq transcriptomic profiles. ZEB1 is widely expressed in glial tumors, but in a highly variable fraction of cells. In glioblastoma, ZEB1 labeling index is higher in tumors with EGFR amplification or IDH1 mutation. Co-labeling studies showed that tumor cells and reactive astroglia, but not immune cells contribute to the ZEB1 positive population. In contrast, glioma cell lines constitutively express ZEB1 irrespective of gene expression subtype. In conclusion, our data indicate that immune infiltration likely contributes to differential labelling of ZEB1 and confounds interpretation of bulk ZEB1 expression data.

Quantitative non-invasive cell characterisation and discrimination based on multispectral autofluorescence features	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Automated and unbiased methods of non-invasive cell monitoring able to deal with complex biological heterogeneity are fundamentally important for biology and medicine. Label-free cell imaging provides information about endogenous autofluorescent metabolites, enzymes and cofactors in cells. However extracting high content information from autofluorescence imaging has been hitherto impossible. Here, we quantitatively characterise cell populations in different tissue types, live or fixed, by using novel image processing and a simple multispectral upgrade of a wide-field fluorescence microscope. Our optimal discrimination approach enables statistical hypothesis testing and intuitive visualisations where previously undetectable differences become clearly apparent. Label-free classifications are validated by the analysis of Classification Determinant (CD) antigen expression. The versatility of our method is illustrated by detecting genetic mutations in cancer, non-invasive monitoring of CD90 expression, label-free tracking of stem cell differentiation, identifying stem cell subpopulations with varying functional characteristics, tissue diagnostics in diabetes, and assessing the condition of preimplantation embryos.

In several cases, such heterogeneity in drug sensitivity of tumors is driven by stochastic and reversible acquisition of a drug tolerant phenotype by individual cells even in an isogenic population. Accumulating evidence further suggests that cell-fate transitions such as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated with drug resistance. In this study, we analyze stochastic models of phenotypic switching to provide a framework for analyzing cell-fate transitions such as EMT as a source of phenotypic variability in drug sensitivity. Motivated by our cell-culture based experimental observations connecting phenotypic switching in EMT and drug resistance, we analyze a coarse-grained model of phenotypic switching between two states in the presence of cytotoxic stress from chemotherapy. We derive analytical results for time-dependent probability distributions that provide insights into the rates of phenotypic switching and characterize initial phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cells. The results obtained can also shed light on fundamental questions relating to adaptation and selection scenarios in tumor response to cytotoxic therapy.																	2045-2322					JUL 26	2019	9								10845	10.1038/s41598-019-46926-x							WOS:000477698600003	31350465

Polyploid giant cancer cells are a special subpopulation of cancer cells that contribute to solid tumor heterogeneity. The size of PGCC was at least three times larger than regular diploid cancer cells. PGCCs have the properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and can express CSC markers CD44 and CD133. Daughter cells derived from PGCCs have strong proliferation, infiltration and migration abilities. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of daughter cells expressing mesenchymal phenotype and displaying strong abilities of proliferation and migration is unclear. As a plasminogen receptor, S100A10 which is closely associated with the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors, was highly expressed in PGCCs with their daughter cells. In this study, CoCl2 was used to induce the formation of PGCCs in LoVo and HCT116 CRC cells. Cell functional experiments, co-immunoprecipitation, MG132 and ginkgolic acid treatment, western blot, and ChIP-Seq were used to identify the mechanism of S100A10 nuclear location. The proliferation and migration abilities of PGCCs and their daughter cells decreased significantly after S100A10 knockdown. In the control cells, S100A10 was mainly ubiquitinated, while in PGCCs and daughter cells, S100A10 was mainly SUMOylated, which was associated with S100A10 nuclear location. After SUMO1 was inhibited, the nuclear S100A10 in PGCCs and daughter cells decreased, and their proliferation and migration abilities significantly decreased. ChIP-Seq combined with real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR showed that S100A10 regulated the expression of neutrophil defensin 3 (DEFA3), receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase N2 (PTPRN2), and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 18 (ARHGEF18), which were associated with actin dynamics and cytoskeleton remodeling. The expression of S100A10 in the nuclei and cytoplasm of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) and liver metastases increased compared with that in rectal cancer without nCRT. Taken together, the expression and nuclear localization of S100A10 modified by SUMOylation were associated with the high proliferation and migration of PGCCs and their daughter cells, and the differentiation, metastases, and relapse of CRCs by regulating the expression of ARHGEF18, PTPRN2, and DEFA3.																	2296-634X					JUL 16	2021	9								696871	10.3389/fcell.2021.696871							WOS:000679870300001	34336846

The complicated mechanisms underlying the maintenance of CSCs are keeping in illustration. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), due to their multifunction in various biological processes, have been indicated to play a crucial role in CSC renewal and stemness maintenance. Using lncRNA array, we identified a novel lncRNA (named lnc408) in epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related breast CSCs (BCSCs). The lnc408 is high expressed in BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. The enhanced lnc408 is critical to BCSC characteristics and tumorigenesis. Lnc408 can recruit transcript factor SP3 to CBY1 promoter to serve as an inhibitor in CBY1 transcription in BCSCs. The high expressed CBY1 in non-BCSC interacts with 14-3-3 and beta-catenin to form a ternary complex, which leads a translocation of the ternary complex into cytoplasm from nucleus and degradation of beta-catenin in phosphorylation-dependent pattern. The lnc408-mediated decrease of CBY1 in BCSCs impairs the formation of 14-3-3/beta-catenin/CBY1 complex, and keeps beta-catenin in nucleus to promote CSC-associated CD44, SOX2, Nanog, Klf4, and c-Myc expressions and contributes to mammosphere formation; however, restoration of CBY1 expression in tumor cells reduces BCSC and its enrichment, thus lnc408 plays an essential role in maintenance of BCSC stemness. In shortly, these findings highlight that the novel lnc408 functions as an oncogenic factor by recruiting SP3 to inhibit CBY1 expression and beta-catenin accumulation in nucleus to maintain stemness properties of BCSCs. Lnc408-CBY1-beta-catenin signaling axis might serve as a new diagnostic and therapeutic target for breast cancer.																	2041-4889					MAY 1	2021	12	5							437	10.1038/s41419-021-03708-6							WOS:000656503700003	33934099

Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) were identified as a subset of cells within the tumor in a variety of solid tumors including HNSCC. CSC are considered the tumor-initiating population responsible for recurrence or metastasis and are associated with therapy resistance. This meta-analysis including fourteen studies with altogether 1258 patients updates and summarizes all relevant data on the impact of ALDH1(+) CSC on the prognosis of HNSCC and its association with clinicopathological parameters. ALDH1 expression is highly correlated with tumor differentiation (G3 vs. G1+G2; odds ratio = 2.85. 95% CI: 1.72-4.73, P<0.0001) and decreased overall survival (relative risk = 1.77. 95% CI: 1.41-2.22, P<0.0001) if one out of seven studies was excluded because of heterogeneity. These findings provide insights into the understanding of more aggressive tumor phenotypes and also suggest that the prognostic value provided by HNSCC-subtyping by CSC frequency warrant further clinical investigation.

Aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is a transmembrane protein that transports water and reportedly transports H2O2. Recent studies have shown that AQP9 expression has a negative effect on HCC cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, the role of AQP9 in LCSCs remains obscure. We performed spheroid formation assay and flow cytometric analysis to investigate LCSCs stemness. CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells were isolated by flow cytometry. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence assay were used to estimate gene expression. The protein association of beta-catenin with TCF4 and the interaction of beta-catenin with FOXO3a were detected by immunoprecipitation (IP). Here, we found that AQP9 was preferentially decreased in LCSCs. Upregulated AQP9 significantly suppressed LCSCs sternness. In contrast, the inhibition of AQP9 had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, AQP9 was shown to be downregulated by insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which was widely reported to contribute to maintaining CSCs stemness. Furthermore, AQP9 overexpression was found to result in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which inhibited beta-catenin activity by attenuating the interaction of beta-catenin with TCF4 while concurrently enhancing the association of beta-catenin with FOXO3a, ultimately inhibiting LCSCs stemness. Our study implies that stimulation of the AQP9 signaling axis may he a novel preventive and/or therapeutic approach for eliminating LCSCs.																	1541-7786	1557-3125				JUL	2020	18	7					992	1003		10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-1180							WOS:000546016600005	32229502

Cancer progression is under the strict control of the the tumor microenvironment that strongly determines its success by regulating the behavioral changes of tumor cells. The cross-talk between cancer and stromal cells and the interactions with the extracellular matrix, hypoxia and acidosis contribute to trigger a new tumor cell identity and to enhance tumor heterogeneity and metastatic spread. In highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer, tumor cells show a significant capability to change their phenotype under the pressure of the hypoxic microenvironment. In this study, we investigated whether targeting the hypoxia-induced protein carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) could reduce triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell phenotypic switching involved in processes associated with poor prognosis such as vascular mimicry (VM) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). The treatment of two TNBC cell lines (BT-549 and MDA-MB-231) with a specific CA IX siRNA or with a novel inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases (RC44) severely impaired their ability to form a vascular-like network and mammospheres and reduced their metastatic potential. In addition, the RC44 inhibitor was able to hamper the signal pathways involved in triggering VM and CSC formation. These results demonstrate that targeting hypoxia-induced cell plasticity through CA IX inhibition could be a new opportunity to selectively reduce VM and CSCs, thus improving the efficiency of existing therapies in TNBC.

The aim of this study was to investigate and characterise tumour-propagating cell (TPC) compartments within human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: After long-term culture, we identified three morphologically different tumour cell populations in a single HCC specimen, and extensively characterised them by means of flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, karyotyping and microarray analyses, single cell cloning, and xenotransplantation in NOD/SCID/IL2Rc gamma(-/-) mice. Results: The primary cell populations (hcc-1, -2 and -3) and two clones generated by means of limiting dilutions from hcc-1 (clone-1/7 and -1/8) differently expressed a number of tumour-associated stem cell markers, including EpCAM, CD49f, CD44, CD133, CD56, Thy-1, ALDH and CK19, and also showed different doubling times, drug resistance and tumorigenic potential. Moreover, we found that ALDH expression, in combination with CD44 or Thy-1 negativity or CD56 positivity identified subpopulations with a higher clonogenic potential within hcc-1, hcc-2 and hcc-3 primary cell populations, respectively. Karyotyping revealed the clonal evolution of the cell populations and clones within the primary tumour. Importantly, the primary tumour cell population with the greatest tumorigenic potential and drug resistance showed more chromosomal alterations than the others and contained clones with epithelial and mesenchymal features. Conclusions: Individual HCCs can harbor different self-renewing tumorigenic cell types expressing a variety of morphological and phenotypical markers, karyotypic evolution and different gene expression profiles. This suggests that the models of hepatic carcinogenesis should take into account TPC heterogeneity due to intratumour clonal evolution.

Suhas; Ihsan, Mario O.; Kin, Xiao Xuan; Welsch, Roy E.; Clement, Marie-Veronique; Tucker-Kellogg, Lisa			TRANSCOMPP: understanding phenotypic plasticity by estimating Markov transition rates for cell state transitions	BIOINFORMATICS												Motivation: Gradual population-level changes in tissues can be driven by stochastic plasticity, meaning rare stochastic transitions of single-cell phenotype. Quantifying the rates of these stochastic transitions requires time-intensive experiments, and analysis is generally confounded by simultaneous bidirectional transitions and asymmetric proliferation kinetics. To quantify cellular plasticity, we developed TRANSCOMPP (Transition Rate ANalysis of Single Cells to Observe and Measure Phenotypic Plasticity), a Markov modeling algorithm that uses optimization and resampling to compute best-fit rates and statistical intervals for stochastic cell-state transitions. Results: We applied TRANSCOMPP to time-series datasets in which purified subpopulations of stem-like or non-stem cancer cells were exposed to various cell culture environments, and allowed to re-equilibrate spontaneously over time. Results revealed that commonly used cell culture reagents hydrocortisone and cholera toxin shifted the cell population equilibrium toward stem-like or non-stem states, respectively, in the basal-like breast cancer cell line MCF10CA1a. In addition, applying TRANSCOMPP to patient-derived cells showed that transition rates computed from short-term experiments could predict long-term trajectories and equilibrium convergence of the cultured cell population.

Recent studies have reported that HCC may be derived not only from adult hepatocytes and hepatoblasts but also hepatic stem/progenitors. In this context, HepaRG cells may represent a suitable cellular model to study stem/progenitor cancer cells and the retrodifferentiation of tumor-derived hepatocyte-like cells. Indeed, they differentiate into hepatocyte-and biliary-like cells. Moreover, tumor-derived HepaRG hepatocyte-like cells (HepaRG-tdHep) differentiate into both hepatocyte-and biliary-like cells through a hepatic progenitor. In this study we report the mechanisms and molecular effectors involved in the retrodifferentiation of HepaRG-tdHep into bipotent progenitors. Gene expression profiling was used to identify genomic changes during the retrodifferentiation of HepaRG-tdHep into progenitors. We demonstrated that gene expression signatures related to a poor-prognosis HCC subclass, proliferative progenitors, or embryonic stem cells were significantly enriched in HepaRG progenitors derived from HepaRGtdHep. HepaRG-tdHep retrodifferentiation is mediated by crosstalk between transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFb1) and inflammatory cytokine pathways (e. g., tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFa] and interleukin 6 [IL6]). Signatures related to TNFa, IL6, and TGFb activation pathways are induced within the first hour of retrodifferentiation. Moreover, specific activation or inhibition of these signaling pathways allowed us to determine that TNFa and IL6 contribute to the loss of hepatic-specific marker expression and that TGFb1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of HepaRG-tdHep. Interestingly, the retrodifferentiation process is blocked by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, opening new therapeutic opportunities. Conclusion: Cancer progenitor cells (or metastasis progenitors) may derive from tumor-derived hepatocyte-like cells in an inflammatory environment that is frequently associated with HCC.

A 3D in vitro model to explore the inter-conversion between epithelial and mesenchymal states during EMT and its reversion	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are strongly implicated in cancer dissemination. Intermediate states, arising from inter-conversion between epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) states, are characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity combining E and M features and increased plasticity. Hybrid EMT states are highly relevant in metastatic contexts, but have been largely neglected, partially due to the lack of physiologically-relevant 3D platforms to study them. Here we propose a new in vitro model, combining mammary E cells with a bioengineered 3D matrix, to explore phenotypic and functional properties of cells in transition between E and M states. Optimized alginate-based 3D matrices provided adequate 3D microenvironments, where normal epithelial morphogenesis was recapitulated, with formation of acini-like structures, similar to those found in native mammary tissue. TGF beta 1-driven EMT in 3D could be successfully promoted, generating M-like cells. TGF beta 1 removal resulted in phenotypic switching to an intermediate state (RE cells), a hybrid cell population expressing both E and M markers at gene/protein levels. RE cells exhibited increased proliferative/clonogenic activity, as compared to M cells, being able to form large colonies containing cells with front-back polarity, suggesting a more aggressive phenotype. Our 3D model provides a powerful tool to investigate the role of the microenvironment on metastable EMT stages.

Due to the small number and the heterogeneity of primary isolated BMSCs, extensive in vitro expansion is usually required before application, which affects the cellular characteristics and gene expression of BMSCs. However, whether the radiation response of BMSCs changes during in vitro expansion is unclear.MethodsIn this study, BMSCs were passaged in vitro and irradiated at passage 6 (P6) and passage 10 (P10).Then, apoptosis, the cell cycle, senescence, the cytokine secretion and the gene expression profile were analysed for the P6, P10, and non-irradiated (control) BMSCs at different post-irradiation time points.ResultsThe P6 BMSCs had a lower percentage of apoptotic cells than the P10 BMSCs at 24 and 48h post-irradiation but not compared to that of the controls at 2 and 8h post-irradiation.The P6 BMSCs had a lower percentage of cells in S phase and a higher percentage in G1 phase than the P10 BMSCs at 2 and 8h post-irradiation. The radiation had similar effects on the senescent cell level and impaired immunomodulation capacity of the P6 and P10 BMSCs. Regardless of whether they were irradiated, the P6 and P10 BMSCs always expressed a distinctive set of genes. The upregulated genes were enriched in pathways including the cell cycle, DNA replication and oocyte meiosis.Then, a subset of conserved irradiation response genes across the BMSCs was identified, comprising 12 differentially upregulated genes and 5 differentially downregulated genes.These genes were especially associated with the p53 signaling pathway, DNA damage and DNA repair. Furthermore, validation experiments revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of these conserved genes were different between the P6 and P10 BMSCs after irradiation. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis supported these findings and further revealed the effects of cell passage on the irradiation response in BMSCs.ConclusionThe results indicated that cell passage in vitro affected the irradiation response of BMSCs via molecular mechanisms that mediated differences in apoptosis, the cell cycle, senescence and the cytokine secretion. Thus, accurate cell passage information is not only important for transplantation therapy but also for future studies on the radiation response in BMSCs.				quan, weili/B-7254-2011														1757-6512				MAR 8	2019	10								82	10.1186/s13287-019-1191-3							WOS:000460812000002	30850008

Here, we developed multi-color Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based enzymatic substrates and use them in a microfluidics platform to simultaneously measure multiple specific protease activities from water-in-oil droplets that contain single cells. By integrating the microfluidic platform with a computational analytical method, Proteolytic Activity Matrix Analysis (PrAMA), we are able to infer six different protease activity signals from individual cells in a high throughput manner (similar to 100 cells/experimental run). We characterized protease activity profiles at single cell resolution for several cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231, lung cancer cell line PC-9, and leukemia cell line K-562 using both live-cell and in-situ cell lysis assay formats, with special focus on metalloproteinases important in metastasis. The ability to measure multiple proteases secreted from or expressed in individual cells allows us to characterize cell heterogeneity and has potential applications including systems biology, pharmacology, cancer diagnosis and stem cell biology.

Experimental Design: We identified three proteins, CLIC4, ERp29, and Smac/DIABLO, from metastatic cancer stem-like cells of colorectal cancer and verified the proteins' role in metastatic behaviors. The proteins were detected by IHC in colorectal cancer tumors and matched colonic mucosa from patients with colorectal cancer who underwent radical surgery in the training cohort. The associations between proteins expression levels and five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) were evaluated to predict the survival probability in the training cohort of 421 cases and the validation cohort of 228 cases. Results: A three-protein panel including CLIC4, ERp29, and Smac/DIABLO, which was generated from multivariate analysis by excluding clinicopathologic characteristics from the training cohort, distinguished patients with colorectal cancer into very low-, low-, middle-, and high-risk groups with significant differences in five-year DSS probability (88.6%, 63.3%, 30.4%, 11.4%; P < 0.001). The panel is independent from tumor-node-metastasis staging system and histologic grading to predict prognosis, and also enables classification of validation cohort into four risk stratifications (five-year DSS probability is 98.2%, 80.2%, 25.6%, and 2.7%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: CLIC4, ERp29, and Smac/DIABLO integrated into a novel panel based on cancer stem-like cells in association with metastasis stratify the prognostic risks of colorectal cancer. Prediction of risks with molecular markers will benefit clinicians to make decisions of individual management with postoperative colorectal cancer patients. (C) 2014 AACR.

Cell Surface Profiling Using High-Throughput Flow Cytometry: A Platform for Biomarker Discovery and Analysis of Cellular Heterogeneity	PLOS ONE												Cell surface proteins have a wide range of biological functions, and are often used as lineage-specific markers. Antibodies that recognize cell surface antigens are widely used as research tools, diagnostic markers, and even therapeutic agents. The ability to obtain broad cell surface protein profiles would thus be of great value in a wide range of fields. There are however currently few available methods for high-throughput analysis of large numbers of cell surface proteins. We describe here a high-throughput flow cytometry (HT-FC) platform for rapid analysis of 363 cell surface antigens. Here we demonstrate that HT-FC provides reproducible results, and use the platform to identify cell surface antigens that are influenced by common cell preparation methods. We show that multiple populations within complex samples such as primary tumors can be simultaneously analyzed by co-staining of cells with lineage-specific antibodies, allowing unprecedented depth of analysis of heterogeneous cell populations. Furthermore, standard informatics methods can be used to visualize, cluster and downsample HT-FC data to reveal novel signatures and biomarkers. We show that the cell surface profile provides sufficient molecular information to classify samples from different cancers and tissue types into biologically relevant clusters using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Finally, we describe the identification of a candidate lineage marker and its subsequent validation. In summary, HT-FC combines the advantages of a high-throughput screen with a detection method that is sensitive, quantitative, highly reproducible, and allows in-depth analysis of heterogeneous samples. The use of commercially available antibodies means that high quality reagents are immediately available for follow-up studies. HT-FC has a wide range of applications, including biomarker discovery, molecular classification of cancers, or identification of novel lineage specific or stem cell markers.				; Wouters, Bradly/T-1525-2017	Wang, Jean/0000-0001-7543-3917; Gedye, Craig/0000-0002-1629-4352; Wouters, Bradly/0000-0002-8187-592X; van den Beucken, Twan/0000-0002-2233-7558; Rottapel, Robert/0000-0002-6024-5558; Lobo, Nazleen/0000-0003-2696-3676												1932-6203					AUG 29	2014	9	8							e105602	10.1371/journal.pone.0105602							WOS:000341127500061	25170899

Self-Organizing Tissue-Engineered Constructs in Collagen Hydrogels	MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS												A novel self-organizing behavior of cellularized gels composed of collagen type 1 that may have utility for tissue engineering is described. Depending on the starting geometry of the tissue culture well, toroidal rings of cells or hollow spheroids were prompted to form autonomously when cells were seeded onto the top of gels and the gels released from attachment to the culture well 12 to 24 h after seeding. Cells within toroids assumed distinct patterns of alignment not seen in control gels in which cells had been mixed in. In control gels, cells formed complex three-dimensional arrangements and assumed relatively higher levels of heterogeneity in expression of the fibronectin splice variant ED-A-a marker of epithelial mesenchymal transformation. The tissue-like constructs resulting from this novel self-organizing behavior may have uses in wound healing and regenerative medicine, as well as building blocks for the iterative assembly of synthetic biological structures.																	1431-9276					FEB	2012	18	1					99	106		10.1017/S1431927611012372							WOS:000299757100009	22214557

The discovery of the cancer stem cell (CSC)-specific drug salinomycin raised hope for improved treatment options by targeting therapy-refractory CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells. However, the occurrence of an acquired salinomycin resistance in tumor cells remains elusive. To study the formation of salinomycin resistance, mesenchymal breast cancer cells were sequentially treated with salinomycin in an in vitro cell culture assay, and the resulting differences in gene expression and salinomycin susceptibility were analyzed. We demonstrated that long-term salinomycin treatment of mesenchymal cancer cells resulted in salinomycin-resistant cells with elevated levels of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and miR-200c, a decreased migratory capability, and a higher susceptibility to the classic chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The formation of salinomycin resistance through the acquisition of epithelial traits was further validated by inducing mesenchymal-epithelial transition through an overexpression of miR-200c. The transition from a mesenchymal to a more epithelial-like phenotype of salinomycin-treated tumor cells was moreover confirmed in vivo, using syngeneic and, for the first time, transgenic mouse tumor models. These results suggest that the acquisition of salinomycin resistance through the clonal selection of epithelial-like cancer cells could become exploited for improved cancer therapies by antagonizing the tumor-progressive effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are an attractive cell source for stem cell therapy because they can be isolated easily from fat tissue in significant numbers and exhibit multiple differentiation potential under appropriate in vitro culture conditions. However, ASCs derived from individual donors can show wide variations in differentiation potential. In addition, the regulatory mechanisms underlying stem cell differentiation remain unclear. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) is a well-known ASC chondrogenic differentiation factor that stimulates ASC signaling pathways by activating transmembrane type I and type II receptors. We hypothesized that the chondrogenic differentiation potential of ASCs is dependent upon the expression of TGF beta receptors and could be improved by the co-delivery of type I (TGF beta RI) and type II (TGF beta RII) TGF beta receptors. To prove this, heterogeneity within the chondrogenic potential of ASCs isolated from 10 donors was examined and their susceptibility to TGF beta during the process of chondrogenic differentiation investigated. In addition, the results showed that co-delivery of the TGF beta RI and TGF beta RII genes increased the expression of TGF beta receptor signaling in ASCs with low chondrogenic potential, resulting in increased chondrogenic differentiation. Monitoring and delivering TGF beta RI and TGF beta RII may, therefore, be a powerful tool for predicting the differentiation potential of stem cells and for enhancing their differentiation capacity prior to stem cell transplantation.

How less aggressive luminal-like breast cancer transitions to invasive cancer remains unclear. Our study revealed that CD44(hi) cancer cells are the leading subpopulation in collectively invading luminal cancer cells and efficiently promote the collective invasion of CD44(lo)/follower cells. The CD44(hi)/leader subpopulation showed a specific gene signature of various hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal genes and key functional coregulators of collective invasion, which was distinct from that of CD44(lo)/follower cells. However, the CD44(hi)/leader cells, which showed a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, readily switched to the CD44(lo) phenotype along with collective migration and vice versa; this phenomenon was spontaneous and sensitive to the tumor microenvironment. The CD44(lo)-to-CD44(hi) conversion was accompanied by a shift in CD44s to CD44v but not a conversion of non-cancer stem cells to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Therefore, the CD44(hi) leader cells, as currently identified, are not a stable subpopulation in breast tumors. This plasticity and ability to generate CD44(hi) carcinoma cells with enhanced migratory and invasive behavior might be responsible for the transition from in situ to invasive behavior of luminal-type breast cancer.																	0950-9232	1476-5594				NOV 14	2019	38	46					7113	7132		10.1038/s41388-019-0899-y							WOS:000496930500001	31417182

Here, we aimed to gain insights into the molecular basis of hypoxia-induced cancer cell plasticity in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To achieve this goal, we employed our previously published in-vitro model of TNBC, in which a small subset of stem-like cells can be distinguished from the bulk cell population based on their responsiveness to a Sox2 reporter. In MDA-MB-231, a TNBC cell line, we observed that hypoxia significantly increased the expression of luciferase and green fluorescence protein (GFP), the readouts of the Sox2 reporter. Upon hypoxic challenge, the bulk, reporter unresponsive (RU) cells acquired stem-like features, as evidenced by the significant increases in the proportion of CD44(high)/CD24(low) cells, colony formation and resistance to cisplatin. Correlating with these phenotypic changes, RU cells exposed to hypoxia exhibited a substantial upregulation of the active/phosphorylated form of STAT3 (pSTAT3). This hypoxia-induced activation of STAT3 correlated with increased STAT3 transcriptional activity, as evidenced by increased STAT3-DNA binding and an altered gene expression profile. This hypoxia-induced STAT3 activation is biologically significant, since siRNA knockdown of STAT3 in RU cells significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced acquisition of Sox2 activity and stem-like phenotypic features. In conclusion, our data have provided the proof-of-concept that STAT3 is a critical mediator in promoting the hypoxia-induced acquisition of cancer stemness in TNBC. Targeting STAT3 in TNBC may be useful in overcoming chemoresistance and decreasing the risk of disease relapse.

However, the alternative polyadenylation (APA) profiles of TNBC remain unknown. Here, we aimed to define the characteristics of the APA events at post-transcription level among TNBCs. Methods: Using transcriptome microarray data, we analyzed APA profiles of 165 TNBC samples and 33 paired normal tissues. A pooled short hairpin RNA screen targeting 23 core cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) genes was used to identify key C/P factors. Results: We established an unconventional APA subtyping system composed of four stable subtypes: 1) luminal androgen receptor (LAR), 2) mesenchymal-like immune-activated (MLIA), 3) basal-like (BL), 4) suppressed (S) subtypes. Patients in the S subtype had the worst disease-free survival comparing to other patients (log-rank p = 0.021). Enriched clinically actionable pathways and putative therapeutic APA events were analyzed among each APA subtype. Furthermore, CPSF1 and PABPN1 were identified as the master C/P factors in regulating APA events and TNBC proliferation. The depletion of CPSF1 or PABPN1 weakened cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, resulted in cell cycle redistribution and a reversion of APA events of genes associated with tumorigenesis, proliferation, metastasis and chemosensitivity in breast cancer. Conclusions: Our findings advance the understanding of tumor heterogeneity regulation in APA and yield new insights into therapeutic target identification in TNBC.																	1838-7640						2020	10	23					10531	10547		10.7150/thno.40944							WOS:000566786700011	32929364					
S	Takagi, M		Bao, J; Ye, Q; Zhong, JJ		Takagi, Mutsumi			Cell Processing Engineering for Regenerative Medicine Noninvasive Cell Quality Estimation and Automatic Cell Processing	BIOREACTOR ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS II	Advances in Biochemical Engineering-Biotechnology											The cell processing engineering including automatic cell processing and noninvasive cell quality estimation of adherent mammalian cells for regenerative medicine was reviewed. Automatic cell processing necessary for the industrialization of regenerative medicine was introduced. The cell quality such as cell heterogeneity should be noninvasively estimated before transplantation to patient, because cultured cells are usually not homogeneous but heterogeneous and most protocols of regenerative medicine are autologous system. The differentiation level could be estimated by two-dimensional cell morphology analysis using a conventional phase-contrast microscope. The phase-shifting laser microscope (PLM) could determine laser phase shift at all pixel in a view, which is caused by the transmitted laser through cell, and might be more noninvasive and more useful than the atomic force microscope and digital holographic microscope. The noninvasive determination of the laser phase shift of a cell using a PLM was carried out to determine the three-dimensional cell morphology and estimate the cell cycle phase of each adhesive cell and the mean proliferation activity of a cell population. The noninvasive discrimination of cancer cells from normal cells by measuring the phase shift was performed based on the difference in cytoskeleton density. Chemical analysis of the culture supernatant was also useful to estimate the differentiation level of a cell population. A probe beam, an infrared beam, and Raman spectroscopy are useful for diagnosing the viability, apoptosis, and differentiation of each adhesive cell.																	0724-6145		978-3-662-48347-3; 978-3-662-48346-6				2016	152						53	74		10.1007/10_2014_282	10.1007/978-3-662-48347-3						WOS:000396056900004	25373455

Magnetic separation of peripheral nerve-resident cells underscores key molecular features of human Schwann cells and fibroblasts: an immunochemical and transcriptomics approach	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Nerve-derived human Schwann cell (SC) cultures are irreplaceable models for basic and translational research but their use can be limited due to the risk of fibroblast overgrowth. Fibroblasts are an ill-defined population consisting of highly proliferative cells that, contrary to human SCs, do not undergo senescence in culture. We initiated this study by performing an exhaustive immunological and functional characterization of adult nerve-derived human SCs and fibroblasts to reveal their properties and optimize a protocol of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to separate them effectively both as viable and biologically competent cells. We next used immunofluorescence microscopy imaging, flow cytometry analysis and next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to unambiguously characterize the post-MACS cell products. High resolution transcriptome profiling revealed the identity of key lineage-specific transcripts and the clearly distinct neural crest and mesenchymal origin of human SCs and fibroblasts, respectively. Our analysis underscored a progenitor- or stem cell-like molecular phenotype in SCs and fibroblasts and the heterogeneity of the fibroblast populations. In addition, pathway analysis of RNA-seq data highlighted putative bidirectional networks of fibroblast-to-SC signaling that predict a complementary, yet seemingly independent contribution of SCs and fibroblasts to nerve regeneration. In sum, combining MACS with immunochemical and transcriptomics approaches provides an ideal workflow to exhaustively assess the identity, the stage of differentiation and functional features of highly purified cells from human peripheral nerve tissues.

This approach consists in seeding primary MM cells freshly extracted from bone marrow aspirates into microfluidic chambers implemented in multi-well plates, each consisting of a reconstruction of the bone marrow microenvironment, including extracellular matrix (collagen or basement membrane matrix) and stroma (patient-derived mesenchymal stem cells) or human-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs). The chambers are drugged with different agents and concentrations, and are imaged sequentially for 96 hr through bright field microscopy, in a motorized microscope equipped with a digital camera. Digital image analysis software detects live and dead cells from presence or absence of membrane motion, and generates curves of change in viability as a function of drug concentration and exposure time. We use a computational model to determine the parameters of chemosensitivity of the tumor population to each drug, as well as the number of sub-populations present as a measure of tumor heterogeneity. These patient-tailored models can then be used to simulate therapeutic regimens and estimate clinical response.																	1940-087X					JUL	2015		101							e53070	10.3791/53070							WOS:000361536200060	26274375

The external microenvironment shapes the molecular profile of tumor culture models, thus influencing potential therapy response. Our study examines the expression profile of selected lncRNAs involved in tumor resistance network in three different glioblastoma-derived models commonly utilized for testing drug response in vitro. Differential expression analysis revealed significant divergence in lncRNA profile between parental tumors and tumor-derived cell cultures in vitro, including the following particles: MALAT1, CASC2, H19, TUSC7, XIST, RP11-838N2.4, DLX6-AS1, GLIDR, MIR210HG, SOX2-OT. The examined lncRNAs influence the phenomenon of tumor resistance via their downstream target genes through a variety of processes: multi-drug resistance, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, autophagy, cell proliferation and viability, and DNA repair. A comparison of in vivo and in vitro expression identified differences in the levels of potential lncRNA targets, with the highest discrepancies detected for the MDR1, LRP1, BCRP and MRP1 genes. Co-expression analyses confirmed the following interrelations: MALAT1-TYMS, MALAT1-MRP5, H19-ZEB1, CASC2-VIM, CASC2-N-CAD; they additionally suggest the possibility of MALAT1-BCRP, MALAT1-mTOR and TUSC7-PTEN interconnections in glioblastoma. Although our results clearly demonstrate that the artificial ex vivo microenvironment changes the profile of lncRNAs related to tumor resistance, it is difficult to anticipate the final phenotypic effect, since this phenomenon is a complex one that involves a network of molecular interactions underlying a variety of cellular processes.

Gene expression datasets of CSCs from six studies were subjected to connectivity map to identify drugs that may ameliorate gene expression patterns unique to CSCs. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was negatively connected with gene expression in CSCs. ATRA reduced mammosphere-forming ability of a subset of breast cancer cells, which correlated with induction of apoptosis, reduced expression of SOX2 but elevated expression of its antagonist CDX2. SOX2/CDX2 ratio had prognostic relevance in CSC-enriched breast cancers. K-ras mutant breast cancer cell line enriched for CSCs was resistant to ATRA, which was reversed by MAP kinase inhibitors. Thus, ATRA alone or in combination can be tested for efficacy using SOX2, CDX2, and K-ras mutation/MAPK activation status as biomarkers of response.

To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells), a method that shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. We validate MAGIC on several biological systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously un-characterized regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover regulatory relations without perturbations.

Celecoxib is one of the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have chemo-preventive activity against cancers, including breast cancer and colorectal cancer. However, the mechanisms by which NSAIDs exert its cancer prevention effects have yet been completely understood. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the effect of celecoxib on breast CSCs inhibition and its potential molecular mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that celecoxib suppresses CSC self-renewal, sensitizes chemo-resistance, inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and attenuates metastasis and tumorigenesis. Further exploring the underlying mechanism revealed that celecoxib targets breast CSCs by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin E-2 and down-regulating the Wnt pathway activity. Our findings suggest that celecoxib, by targeting CSCs, may be used as an adjuvant chemotherapy drug to improve breast cancer treatment outcomes.

DNA Damage Follows Repair Factor Depletion and Portends Genome Variation in Cancer Cells after Pore Migration	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Migration through micron-size constrictions has been seen to rupture the nucleus, release nuclear localized GFP, and cause localized accumulations of ectopic 53BP1 a DNA repair protein. Here, constricted migration of two human cancer cell types and primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) increases DNA breaks throughout the nucleoplasm as assessed by endogenous damage markers and by electrophoretic "comet" measurements. Migration also causes multiple DNA repair proteins to segregate away from DNA, with cytoplasmic mis-localization sustained for many hours as is relevant to delayed repair. Partial knockdown of repair factors that also regulate chromosome copy numbers is seen to increase DNA breaks in U2OS osteosarcoma cells without affecting migration and with nucleoplasmic patterns of damage similar to constricted migration. Such depletion also causes aberrant levels of DNA. Migration-induced nuclear damage is nonetheless reversible for wild-type and sub-cloned U2OS cells, except for lasting genomic differences between stable clones as revealed by DNA arrays and sequencing. Gains and losses of hundreds of megabases in many chromosomes are typical of the changes and heterogeneity in bone cancer. Phenotypic differences that arise from constricted migration of U2OS clones are further illustrated by a clone with a highly elongated and stable MSC-like shape that depends on micro tubule assembly downstream of the transcription factor GATA4. Such changes are consistent with reversion to a more stem-like state upstream of cancerous osteoblastic cells. Migration-induced genomic instability can thus associate with heritable changes.

In this study, we have investigated metastatic potential of cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from mammary tumors of a Brca1-mutant mouse model. Our data indicated that CSCs, which are enriched in CD24(+)CD29(+)/CD49f(+) cell population, displayed much higher migration ability than CD24(-)CD29(-)/CD49f (-) cells in tissue culture and enhanced metastatic potential in allograft-nude mice. CD24(+)CD29(+) cells maintained the ability to differentiate and reconstitute heterogeneity in the metastatic tumors whereas CD24(-)CD29(-) cells could not. Corresponding to their enhanced metastatic ability, CD24(+)CD29(+) cells exhibited features of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Finally, using short hairpin RNA to knock down CD29 and/or CD49f in metastatic cancer cells, we demonstrated that while acute knockdown of CD29 or CD49f alone slightly decreased cell migration ability, knockdown of both genes generated a profound effect to block their migration, revealing an overlapping, yet critical function of both genes in the migration of CSCs. Our findings indicate that in addition to serving as markers of CSCs, CD29 and CD49f may also serve as potential therapeutic targets for cancer metastasis.				deng, chuxia/N-6713-2016													0950-9232	1476-5594				NOV 20	2014	33	47					5477	5482		10.1038/onc.2013.516							WOS:000345120700010	24317509					
J	Yaswen, P				Yaswen, Paul			Reinforcing targeted therapeutics with phenotypic stability factors	CELL CYCLE												Deregulated cell cycle progression can often be traced to intrinsic defects in specific regulatory proteins in cancer cells. Knowledge of these primary defects has led to targeted approaches that exploit the defects and spare normal cells. However, the success of such targeted approaches is still hit-or-miss. Genetic and epigenetic variability inherent in most tumors often results in phenotypic heterogeneity that, in turn, results in de novo or acquired resistance to therapeutic agents. The ability of cells to compensate and adapt to the inhibition of a specific cell cycle mediator is not remarkable. What is novel and of great potential importance is that the ability of cells to exhibit such adaptability varies markedly. Phenotypic stability factors that restrict the ability of cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) may dictate the success or failure of targeted therapies by interfering with compensatory changes such as deregulation of CDK2 activity. Identification of existing and new agents that induce and maintain phenotypic stability factors will inform and enable synergistic approaches to the eradication of even the most aggressive tumors.																	1538-4101	1551-4005				DEC 15	2014	13	24					3818	3822		10.4161/15384101.2014.985071							WOS:000348329600011	25483053

Cancer is a complex disease with profound genomic alterations and extensive heterogeneity. Recent studies on large-scale genomics have shed light on the impact of core oncogenic pathways, which are frequently dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancer types. Aberrant activation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling axis has been associated with promoting various oncogenic programs during tumor initiation, progression, and treatment resistance. As a result, HGF-targeted therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. However, recent clinical trials involving HGF-targeted therapies have demonstrated rather disappointing results. Thus, an alternative, in-depth assessment of new patient stratification is necessary to shift the current clinical course. Methods. To address such challenges, we have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of YYB-101, an HGF-neutralizing antibody, in a series of primary glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we performed genome and transcriptome analysis to determine genetic and molecular traits that exhibit therapeutic susceptibility to HGF-mediated therapy. Results. We have identified several differentially expressed genes, including MET, KDR, and SOX3, which are associated with tumor invasiveness, malignancy, and unfavorable prognosis in glioblastoma patients. We also demonstrated the HGF-MET signaling axis as a key molecular determinant in GSC invasion, and we discovered that a significant association in HGF expression existed between mesenchymal phenotype and immune cell recruitment. Conclusions. Upregulation of MET and mesenchymal cellular state are essential in generating HGF-mediated therapeutic responses. Our results provide an important framework for evaluating HGF-targeted therapy in future clinical settings.

However, as the heart matures, this proficiency for regeneration is reduced. This regenerative potential may be influenced by the microenvironment of the heart in the early stages of postnatal development and therefore, cell cultures derived at this stage may contain functional cardiomyocytes and progenitor cells. The aim of this study was to identify key steps in the isolation and culture of such early stage neonatal mouse hearts to allow maximum migration of cardiomyocytes from the explant and their maintenance as functional, long term cultures. Explant cultures of mouse ventricles preserved 3-dimensional structure and generated migrating layers of cardiomyocytes that expressed alpha sarcomeric actin which could be further sub-cultured by enzymatic dissociation. Western blotting demonstrated expression of c-KIT, GATA4, alpha sarcomeric actin and connexin43 proteins after 20 days of explant culture. ACTA1, GATA4, and CX43 continued to express in five weeks old explant cultures while the c-KIT protein was expressed up to two passages during sub-culture. Real time PCR and SQRT PCR also demonstrated gene expression of cardiomyocyte markers in long term cultures. Migrating cells from the explants assembled into contracting spheroids after subculture and expressed the c-KIT protein. Progenitor markers CD44, CD90, and extracellular proteins, periostin and vimentin demonstrated the preservation of cellular heterogeneity in such cultures. Supplementation with Hydrocortisone maintained a cardioprotective environment and reduced the non-myocyte population. This is an optimized and efficient method for the generation of neonatal heart cultures that is not labor intensive and does not require supplementation with cytokines. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Using glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a model system, we sought to determine whether molecular determinants that drive cells toward terminal differentiation are also genetically targeted in carcinogenesis and whether neutralizing such genes also plays an active role to reinforce the impaired differentiation state and promote malignancy. To that end, we screened 71 genes with known roles in promoting nervous system development that also sustain copy number loss in GBM through antineoplastic assay and identified A2BP1 (ataxin 2 binding protein 1, Rbfox1), an RNA-binding and splicing regulator that is deleted in 10% of GBM cases. Integrated in silico analysis of GBM profiles to elucidate the A2BP1 pathway and its role in glioma identified myelin transcription factor 1-like (Myt1L) as a direct transcriptional regulator of A2BP1. Reintroduction of A2BP1 or Myt1L in GBM cell lines and glioma stem cells profoundly inhibited tumorigenesis in multiple assays, and conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of A2BP1 or Myt1L in premalignant neural stem cells compromised neuronal lineage differentiation and promoted orthotopic tumor formation. On the mechanistic level, with the top-represented downstream target TPM1 as an illustrative example, we demonstrated that, among its multiple functions, A2BP1 serves to regulate TPM1's alternative splicing to promote cytoskeletal organization and terminal differentiation and suppress malignancy. Thus, in addition to the activation of self-renewal pathways, the neutralization of genetic programs that drive cells toward terminal differentiation may also promote immature and highly plastic developmental states that contribute to the aggressive malignant properties of GBM.

However, the effects of ABCG2 on CSC-related malignant characteristics in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not well elucidated. In this study, we compared the characteristics of low (ABCG2-) and high (ABCG2+)-ABCG2-expressing PDAC cells after cell sorting. In adherent culture condition, human PDAC cells, PANC-1, contained approximately 10% ABCG2+ cell populations, and ABCG2+ cells displayed more and longer microvilli compared with ABCG2- cells. Unexpectedly, ABCG2+ cells did not show significant drug resistance against fluorouracil, gemcitabine and vincristine, and ABCG2- cells exhibited higher sphere formation ability and stemness marker expression than those of ABCG2+ cells. Cell growth and motility was greater in ABCG2- cells compared with ABCG2+ cells. In contrast, epithelial-mesenchymal transition ability between ABCG2- and ABCG2+ cells was comparable. In 3D culture conditions, spheres derived from ABCG2- cells generated a large number of ABCG2+ cells, and the expression levels of stemness markers in these spheres were higher than spheres from ABCG2+ cells. Furthermore, spheres containing large populations of ABCG2+ cells exhibited high resistance against anti-cancer drugs presumably depending on ABCG2. ABCG2+ cells in PDAC in adherent culture are not correlated with stemness and malignant behaviors, but ABCG2+ cells derived from ABCG2- cells after sphere formation have stemness characteristics and anti-cancer drug resistance. These findings suggest that ABCG2- cells generate ABCG2+ cells and the malignant potential of ABCG2+ cells in PDAC varies depending on their environments.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are regenerative and immuno-privileged cells that are used for both tissue regeneration and treatment of severe inflammation-related disease. For quality control of manufactured MSC batches in regard to mature fat cell contamination, a quantitative method for measuring adipogenesis is needed. Methods. Four previously proposed methods were validated with the use of bone marrow (BM) MSCs during a 21-day in vitro assay. Oil red staining was scored semiquantitatively; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma and fatty acid binding protein (FABP)4 transcripts were measured by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction; FABP4 protein accumulation was evaluated by flow cytometry; and Nile red/4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) ratios were measured in fluorescent microplate assay. Skin fibroblasts and MSCs from fat pad, cartilage and umbilical cord were used as controls. Results. Oil red staining indicated considerable heterogeneity between BM donors and individual cells within the same culture. FABP4 transcript levels increased 100- to 5000-fold by day 21, with large donor variability observed. Flow cytometry revealed increasing intra-culture heterogeneity over time; more granular cells accumulated more FABP4 protein and Nile red fluorescence compared with less granular cells. Nile red increase in day-21 MSCs was similar to 5- and 4-fold, measured by flow cytometry or microplate assay, respectively. MSC proliferation/apoptosis was accounted through the use of Nile red/DAPI ratios; adipogenesis levels in day-21 BM MSCs increased similar to 13-fold, with significant correlations with oil red scoring observed for MSC from other sources. Conclusions. Flow cytometry permits the study of MSC differentiation at the single-cell level and sorting more and less mature cells from mixed cell populations. The microplate assay with the use of the Nile red/DAPI ratio provides rapid quantitative measurements and could be used as a low-cost, high-throughput method to quality-control MSC batches from different tissue sources.

J	Bocci, F; Jolly, MK; Onuchic, JN				Bocci, Federico; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Onuchic, Jose Nelson			A Biophysical Model Uncovers the Size Distribution of Migrating Cell Clusters across Cancer Types	CANCER RESEARCH												Migration from the primary tumor is a crucial step in the metastatic cascade. Cells with various degrees of adhesion and motility migrate and are launched into the bloodstream as single circulating tumor cells (CTC) or multicellular CTC clusters. The frequency and size distributions of these clusters have been recently measured, but the underlying mechanisms enabling these different modes of migration remain poorly understood. We present a biophysical model that couples the phenotypic plasticity enabled by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration to explain the modes of individual and collective cancer cell migration. This reduced physical model captures how cells undergo a transition from individual migration to collective cell migration and robustly recapitulates CTC cluster fractions and size distributions observed experimentally across several cancer types, thus suggesting the existence of common features in the mechanisms underlying cancer cell migration. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms that can maximize the fraction of CTC clusters in circulation. First, mechanisms that prevent a complete EMT and instead increase the population of hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) cells are required to recapitulate CTC size distributions with large clusters of 5 to 10 cells. Second, multiple intermediate E/M states give rise to larger and heterogeneous clusters formed by cells with different epithelial-mesenchymal traits. Overall, this biophysical model provides a platform to continue to bridge the gap between the molecular and biophysical regulation of cancer cell migration and highlights that a complete EMT might not be required for metastasis. Significance: A biophysical model of cancer cell invasion integrates phenotypic heterogeneity and cell migration to interpret experimental observations of circulating tumor cell clusters and provides new predictions.

Recent work described the existence of HF dermal stem cells (hfDSCs), but the genetic regulation of hfDSCs and their daughter cell lineages in HF regeneration remains unknown. Here we prospectively isolate functionally distinct mesenchymal compartment in the HF (dermal cup [DC; includes hfDSCs] and dermal papilla) and define the transcriptional programs involved in hfDSC function and acquisition of divergent mesenchymal fates. From this, we demonstrate cross-compartment mesenchymal signaling within the HF niche, whereby DP-derived R-spondins act to stimulate proliferation of both hfDSCs and epithelial progenitors during HF regeneration. Our findings describe unique transcriptional programs that underlie the functional heterogeneity among specialized fibroblasts within the adult HF and identify a novel regulator of mesenchymal progenitor function during tissue regeneration.

Significant progress has been achieved in the development of therapies for EB, such as bone-marrow transplantation, local or systemic injections with fibroblasts or mesenchymal stromal cells, readthrough of premature termination codons, or exon skipping. These were tailored in particular for dystrophic EB, which is caused by type VII collagen deficiency and have not yet reached broad clinical practice. Recently, pioneering combined gene and stem cell therapy was successful in treating one boy with junctional EB. Beside these exclusive approaches, no specific therapy to amend the major clinical features, skin and mucosal blistering and non-healing wounds is available to date. Here we extend the mutational spectrum of junctional EB, provide a stratification of COL17A1 mutations and discuss potential molecular therapeutic approaches.

These TICs have been shown to be responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to develop specific TIC-targeting therapy in addition to current chemotherapy strategies, which mostly focus on the bulk of non-TICs. In order to further understand the mechanism behind the malignancy of TICs, we describe a method to isolate and to characterize TICs in human sarcomas. Herein, we show a detailed protocol to generate patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of human sarcomas and to isolate TICs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-1) as a negative marker. Also, we describe how to functionally characterize these TICs, including a sphere formation assay and a tumor formation assay, and to induce differentiation along mesenchymal pathways. The isolation and characterization of PDX TICs provide clues for the discovery of potential targeting therapy reagents. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that this protocol may be further extended to isolate and characterize TICs from other types of human cancers.																	1940-087X					JUN	2019		148							e57011	10.3791/57011							WOS:000473295900001	31259909

The synovium is a specialized connective tissue forming the inner encapsulating lining of diarthrodial joints and intra-synovial tendons. It contains multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that render it a viable source of progenitors for tendon repair. This study evaluated the effects of autologous implantation of cells derived from normal synovium (synovial membrane cells [SMCs]) in augmenting repair in an ovine model of intra-synovial tendon injury. For this purpose, synovial biopsies were taken from the right digital flexor tendon sheath following creation of a defect to the lateral deep digital flexor tendon. Mononuclear cells were isolated by partial enzymatic digestion and assessed for MSC characteristics. Cell tracking and tendon repair were assessed by implanting 5 x 10(6) cells into the digital flexor tendon sheath under ultrasound guidance with the effects evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology. Synovial biopsies yielded an average 4.0 x 10(5) +/- 2.7 x 10(5) SMCs that exhibited a fibroblastic morphology, variable osteogenic, and adipogenic responses but were ubiquitously strongly chondrogenic. SMCs displayed high expression of CD29 with CD271(NEGATIVE) and MHC-IILOW cell-surface marker profiles, and variable expression of CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, and MHC-I. Implanted SMCs demonstrated engraftment within the synovium, though a lack of repair of the tendon lesion over 24 weeks was observed. We conclude healthy synovium is a viable source of multipotent cells, but that the heterogeneity of synovium underlies the variability between different SMC populations, which while capable of engraftment and persistence within the synovium exhibit limited capacity of influencing tendon repair.

This regulation is tightly controlled through direct cell-cell interactions with mesenchymal stromal stem (MSCs) and reticular cells, adipocytes, osteoblasts and endothelial cells, through binding to extracellular matrix molecules and through signaling by cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors. These interactions provide a healthy environment and secure the maintenance of the HSPC pool, their proliferation, differentiation and migration. Recent studies have shown that innervation of the BM and interactions with the peripheral sympathetic neural system are important for maintenance of the hematopoietic niche, through direct interactions with HSCPs or via interactions with other cells of the HSPC microenvironment. Signaling through adrenergic receptors (ARs), opioid receptors (ORs), endocannabinoid receptors (CRs) on HSPCs and MSCs has been shown to play an important role in HSPC homeostasis and mobilization. In addition, a wide range of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, such as Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Substance P (SP) and Tachykinins, as well as neurotrophins and neuropoietic growth factors have been shown to be involved in regulation of the hematopoietic niche. Here, a comprehensive overview is given of their role and interactions with important cells in the hematopoietic niche, including HSPCs and MSCs, and their effect on HSPC maintenance, regulation and mobilization.				kose, sevil/ABI-5227-2020; KORKUSUZ, PETEK/I-8321-2013	kose, sevil/0000-0003-2188-9534; UCKAN CETINKAYA, DUYGU/0000-0003-3593-6493; Aerts-Kaya, Fatima/0000-0002-9583-8572												0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-32823-8; 978-3-030-32822-1				2020	1212						127	153		10.1007/5584_2019_398	10.1007/978-3-030-32823-8						WOS:000554916300009	31342461

Therefore, we sought to identify distinct fibroblast subpopulations at the single-cell level. Methods: Using single-cell quantitative PCR as a powerful tool to study heterogeneity and rare cell events, in a high-throughput manner a panel of gene targets are run simultaneously on transcripts isolated from single cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sort. Assessment of cells with stem-like characteristics was attained by anchorage-independent, anoikis-resistant culture. Results: Single-cell analysis of fibroblasts and their tumour-activated counterparts demonstrated molecularly distinct cell types defined by differential expression of characteristic mesenchymal and fibroblast activation markers. Identified subpopulations presented overlapping gene expression patterns indicating transitional molecular states during fibroblast differentiation. Using single-cell resolution data we generated a molecular differentiation model which enabled the classification of patient-derived fibroblasts, validating our modelling approach. Remarkably, a subset of fibroblasts displayed expression of pluripotency markers, which was enriched for in non-adherent conditions. Yet the ability to form single-cell derived spheres was generally reduced in CAFs and upon fibroblast activation through TGF beta 1 ligand and cancer cell-secreted factors. Hence, our data imply the existence of putative stem/progenitor cells as a physiological feature of undifferentiated fibroblasts. Conclusions: Within this comprehensive study we have identified distinct and intersecting molecular profiles defining fibroblast activation states and propose that underlying cellular heterogeneity, fibroblasts are hierarchically organized. Understanding the molecular make-up of cellular organization and differentiation routes will facilitate the discovery of more specific markers for stromal subtypes and targets for anti-stromal therapies.

During radiation therapy (RT), the treatment dose, fractionation, and dose limits for organs at risk (OARs) do not change between patients and are still prescribed mainly based on the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) stage, performance status, and comorbidities, taking no account of the tumor biology. Our data once again emphasize that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy approaches should become more personalized according to RT regimen, tumor histology, and molecular status of critical proteins. Radiotherapy is a primary treatment modality for patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor heterogeneity still poses the central question of cancer radioresistance, whether the presence of a particular cell population inside a tumor undergoing a selective outgrowth during radio- and chemotherapy give rise to metastasis and tumor recurrence. In this study, we examined the impact of two different multifraction X-ray radiation exposure (MFR) regimens, fraction dose escalation (FDE) in the split course and the conventional hypofractionation (HF), on the phenotypic and molecular signatures of four MFR-surviving NSCLC cell sublines derived from parental A549 (p53 wild-type) and H1299 (p53-null) cells, namely A549FR/A549HR, H1299FR/H1299HR cells. We demonstrate that sublines surviving different MFR regimens in a total dose of 60 Gy significantly diverge in their molecular traits related to irradiation regimen and p53 status. The observed changes regarding radiosensitivity, transformation, proliferation, metabolic activity, partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program activation and 1D confined migratory behavior (wound healing). For the first time, we demonstrated that MFR exposure led to the significant decrease in the expression of p63 and p73, the p53-family members, in p53null cells, which correlated with the increase in cell polyploidy. We could not find significant differences in FRA1 expression between parental cells and their sublines that survived after any MFR regimen regardless of p53 status. In our study, the FDE regimen probably causes partial EMT program activation in MFR-survived NSCLC cells through either Vimentin upregulation in p53null or an aberrant N-cadherin upregulation in p53wt cells. The HF regimen likely less influences the EMT activation irrespectively of the p53 status of MFR-survived NSCLC cells. Our data highlight that both MFR regimens caused overall higher cell transformation of p53null H1299FR and H1299HR cells than their parental H1299 cells. Moreover, our results indicate that the FDE regimen raised the radioresistance and transformation of MFR-surviving NSCLC cells irrespectively of their p53 status, though the HF regimen demonstrated a similar effect on p53null NSCLC cells only. Our data once again emphasize that NSCLC therapy approaches should become more personalized according to radiation therapy (RT) regimen, tumor histology, and molecular status of critical proteins.

Current CTC isolation approaches mainly rely on the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which may significantly reduce the ability to capture CTCs when the expression of EpCAM is lost or down-regulated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, a rapid and highly efficient method is developed to isolate and identify heterogeneous CTCs with high efficiency from patient blood samples using the fluorescent-magnetic nanoparticles (F-MNPs). A dual-antibody interface targeting EpCAM and N-cadherin is fabricated onto the F-MNPs to capture epithelial CTCs as well as mesenchymal CTCs from whole blood samples. The poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) brushes of excellent antifouling properties are employed to decrease nonspecific cell adhesion. Moreover, the F-MNPs provide a prompt identification strategy for heterogeneous CTCs (F-MNPs+, Hoechst 33342+, and CD45-) that can directly identify CTCs in a gentle one-step processing within 1 h after isolation from patient blood samples.

But the extent of heterogeneity within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo. Our work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier dysfunction in IBD.

Effectively, tumor plasticity drives adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation leading to stimulation of neoangionesis or tumor escape. Therefore, tumor plasticity is believed to be a great contributor in recurrence and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Importantly, it could be an Achilles' heel of cancer if we could identify molecular mechanisms dictating this phenotype. The reactivation of stem-like signalling pathways is considered a great determinant of tumor plasticity; in addition, a key role has been also attributed to tumor microenvironment (TME). Indeed, it has been proved that cancer cells interact with different cells in the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, well-established communication represents a potential allied in maintenance of a plastic phenotype in cancer cells supporting tumor growth and spread. An important signalling pathway mediating cancer cell-TME crosstalk is represented by the HGF/c-Met signalling. Here, we review the role of the HGF/c-Met signalling in tumor-stroma crosstalk focusing on novel findings underlying its role in tumor plasticity, immune escape, and development of adaptive mechanisms.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-47189-7; 978-3-030-47188-0				2021	1270						31	44		10.1007/978-3-030-47189-7_2	10.1007/978-3-030-47189-7						WOS:000595857200003	33123991

However, the number of PDX models that can represent the heterogeneity of NSCLC between different individuals is still limited. We successfully established nine PDX mice, from which lung adenocarcinoma tumors bearing the KRAS-G12C mutation were the most frequently grafted. We show that the most aggressive tumors have a greater implantation capacity, and the success of their implantation is indicative of a poor prognosis. By using H-score to quantify cell proliferation and mesenchymal markers, we show that PDX tumors evolved towards a more proliferative and mesenchymal phenotype associated with higher protein levels of Ki67, vimentin, and ezrin, suggesting that the evaluation of their combined expression could be used as a prognostic marker to study disease progression. These PDX models provide a valuable platform for NSCLC translational research. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The high mortality is very often a consequence of its late diagnosis when the cancer is already locally advanced or has disseminated. Advances in the study of NSCLC tumors have been achieved by using in vivo models, such as patient-derived xenografts. Apart from drug screening, this approach may also be useful for study of the biology of the tumors. In the present study, surgically resected primary lung cancer samples (n = 33) were implanted in immunodeficient mice, and nine were engrafted successfully, including seven adenocarcinomas, one squamous-cell carcinoma, and one large-cell carcinoma. ADC tumors bearing the KRAS-G12C mutation were the most frequently engrafted in our PDX collection. Protein expression of vimentin, ezrin, and Ki67 were evaluated in NSCLC primary tumors and during serial transplantation by immunohistochemistry, using H-score. Our data indicated a more suitable environment for solid adenocarcinoma, compared to other lung tumor subtypes, to grow and preserve its architecture in mice, and a correlation between higher vimentin and ezrin expression in solid adenocarcinomas. A correlation between high vimentin expression and lung adenocarcinoma tumors bearing KRAS-G12C mutation was also observed. In addition, tumor evolution towards more proliferative and mesenchymal phenotypes was already observed in early PDX tumor passages. These PDX models provide a valuable platform for biomarker discovery and drug screening against tumor growth and EMT for lung cancer translational research.

The constitutive protease release by primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells	JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY												Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells show constitutive release of matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors. We now investigated this constitutive release of protease/protease regulators associated with carcinogenesis (ADAM12, uPA, cystatin B), angiogenesis (serpin E1, uPA, CD147), cancer cell migration (uPA, cystatin C), coagulation (ADAM TS13, serpin C1), inflammation (fetuin A, caspase 1, cystatin C), monocytic differentiation (CFD) or regulation of hematopoiesis (neutrophil elastase). MethodsAML blasts from 79 consecutive patients were cultured in serum-free medium and mediator levels determined in culture supernatants. Results Detectable release of serpin C1 and E1, cystatin B and C, CD147 and uPA was seen for most patients. These mediators together with fetuin A, caspase 1, and CFD were included in a hierarchical clustering analysis and three patient subsets were identified (high, intermediate, and low release). High levels were associated with monocytic differentiation. Global gene expression analyses showed increased levels of several zinc finger proteins for low-release patients and high expression of several cell surface molecules, ATPases, and calcium-binding proteins for high-release patients. Constitutive release of several mediators was also seen for normal hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stem cells. In cocultures of the latter and AML blasts, the release level for most mediators was altered to resemble the levels of the mesenchymal cells cultured alone. Conclusions Differences in constitutive release of protease/protease regulators are a part of the disease heterogeneity in AML.																	0171-5216	1432-1335				OCT	2017	143	10					1985	1998		10.1007/s00432-017-2458-7							WOS:000410801800009	28631213

Stemness and chemoresistance are imparted to the OC cells through TGF beta 1 driven EMT	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY												Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fourth most common gynecological malignancy due to its highly aggressive, recurrent, and drug-resistant nature. The last two features are rendered by the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Factors like TGF1 and their downstream signaling pathways are upregulated in most cancers and are known to induce EMT and stemness, but the exact mechanisms underlying the process remain unelucidated. In our study, TGF1 induced enhanced stem-like properties like high expression of the pluripotent markers SOX2, OCT4a, and NANOG, along with CD44, and CD117 in the OC cells. In addition, increased activity of the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, formation of compact spheroids, and a quiescent phenotype were observed. In deciphering the mechanism behind it, our data propose ZEB1 transcription factor to play a substantial role in inducing the EMT-mediated stemness and chemoresistance. Further, in our study, we elucidated the significant contribution of both Smad and non-Smad pathways like ERK, JNK, and P38 MAPK pathways in the induction of stem-like characteristics. The novelty of the study also resides with the fact in the expression of different lineage-specific markers, like CD31, CD45, and CD117 along with CD44 in the TGF1-induced epithelial ovarian cancer spheroids. This suggests a tendency of the spheroidal cells towards differentiating into heterogenic populations, which is a distinctive feature of a stem cell. Taken together, the present study provides an insight to the molecular cues involved in the acquisition of stemness and chemoresistance along with tumor heterogeneity in TGF1-induced OC cells.

Chemoresistance is a potential cause of relapse and a key characteristic of CSC, but the development of novel therapeutic approaches for targeting these cells has been limited. We previously established osteosarcoma-initiating (OSi) cells by introducing the gene for c-Myc into bone marrow stromal cells of Ink4a/Arf knockout mice. These OSi cells are composed of two distinct clones: highly tumorigenic cells (AX cells), similar to bipotent committed osteochondral progenitor cells, and tripotent cells of low tumorigenicity (AO cells), similar to mesenchymal stem cells. Here we show that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton induces terminal adipocyte differentiation and suppresses tumorigenesis in chemoresistant OSi cells. In contrast to AX cells, AO cells were highly resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and were thus identified as chemoresistant cells. Inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) elicited terminal adipocyte differentiation in chemoresistant AO cells through negative regulation of the transcriptional coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 associated with actin depolymerization. The clinically administered ROCK inhibitor fasudil significantly suppressed growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo of chemoresistant AO cells as well as of OSi cells. Our findings thus suggest a new therapeutic strategy based on the induction of trans-terminal differentiation via modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics for therapy-resistant osteosarcoma stem cells. Significance: These findings suggest that induction of trans-terminal differentiation through regulation of actin dynamics is a potential novel therapeutic approach for targeting chemoresistant stem-like tumor cells.

Most novel cellular therapy products are produced under investigational protocols with no clear standardization across cell processing centers. Thus, the purpose of this study was to uncover any variations in manufacturing practices for similar cellular therapy products across different cell processing laboratories worldwide. Methods: An exploratory survey that was designed to identify variations in manufacturing practices in novel cellular therapy products was sent to cell processing laboratory directors worldwide. The questionnaire focused on the manufacturing life cycle of different cell therapies (i.e., collection, purification, in vitro expansion, freezing and storage, and thawing and washing), as well as the level of regulations followed to process each product type. Results: The majority of the centers processed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from peripheral blood (n = 18), bone marrow (n = 16) or cord blood (n = 19), making HPCs the most commonly processed cells. The next most commonly produced cellular therapies were lymphocytes (n = 19) followed by mesenchymal stromal cells (n = 14), dendritic cells (n = 9) and natural killer (NK) cells (n = 9). A minority of centers (<5) processed pancreatic islet cells (n = 4), neural cells (n = 3) and induced-pluripotent stem cells (n = 3). Thirty-two laboratories processed products under an investigational status, for either phase III (n = 27) or phase III (n = 17) clinical trials. If purification methods were used, these varied for the type of product processed and by institution. Environmental monitoring methods also varied by product type and institution. Conclusion: This exploratory survey shows a wide variation in cellular therapy manufacturing practices across different cell processing laboratories. A better understanding of the effect of these variations on the quality of these cell-based therapies will be important to assess for further process evaluation and development.

Variable expression levels of keratin and vimentin reveal differential EMT status of circulating tumor cells and correlation with clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with metastatic breast cancer	BMC CANCER												Background: CTCs expressing variable levels of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in breast cancer have previously been reported. However, no information exists for keratin expression levels of CTCs in association with disease status, whereas assays for the characterization of transitional EMT phenotypes of CTCs in breast cancer are rather lacking. We investigated the correlation between keratin expression of CTCs and patients' outcome and characterized the EMT status of CTCs via the establishment of a numerical "ratio" value of keratin and vimentin expression levels on a single cell basis. Methods: Keratin expression was evaluated in 1262 CTCs from 61 CTC-positive patients with metastatic breast cancer, using analysis of images obtained through the CellSearch System. For the determination of vimentin/keratin (vim/K) ratios, expression levels of keratin and vimentin were measured in cytospin preparations of luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal (MDA.MB231 and Hs578T) breast cancer cell lines and 110 CTCs from 5 CTC-positive patients using triple immunofluorescence laser scanning microscopy and image analysis. Results: MCF-7 and T47D displayed lower vim/K ratios compared to MDA.MB231 and Hs578T cells, while MCF-7 cells that had experimentally undergone EMT were characterized by varying intermediate vim/K ratios. CTCs were consisted of an heterogeneous population presenting variable vim/K values with 46% of them being in the range of luminal breast cancer cell lines. Keratin expression levels of CTCs detected by the CellSearch System correlated with triple negative (p = 0.039) and ER-negative (p = 0.025) breast cancer, and overall survival (p = 0.038). Conclusions: Keratin expression levels of CTCs correlate with tumor characteristics and clinical outcome. Moreover, CTCs display significant heterogeneity in terms of the degree of EMT phenotype that probably reflects differential invasive potential. The assessment of the vim/K ratios as a surrogate marker for the EMT status of CTCs merits further investigation as a prognostic tool in breast cancer.

NurOwn, phase 2, randomized, clinical trial in patients with ALS Safety, clinical, and biomarker results	NEUROLOGY												Objective To determine the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-neurotrophic factor (NTF) cells (NurOwn (R), autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, induced to secrete NTFs) delivered by combined intrathecal and intramuscular administration to participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial. Methods The study enrolled 48 participants randomized 3:1 (treatment: placebo). After a 3-month pretransplant period, participants received 1 dose of MSC-NTF cells (n = 36) or placebo (n = 12) and were followed for 6 months. CSF was collected before and 2 weeks after transplantation. Results The study met its primary safety endpoint. The rate of disease progression (Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale [ALSFRS-R] slope change) in the overall study population was similar in treated and placebo participants. In a prespecified rapid progressor subgroup (n = 21), rate of disease progression was improved at early time points (p < 0.05). To address heterogeneity, a responder analysis showed that a higher proportion of treated participants experienced >= 1.5 points/month ALSFRS-R slope improvement compared to placebo at all time points, and was significant in rapid progressors at 4 and 12 weeks (p = 0.004 and 0.046, respectively). CSF neurotrophic factors increased and CSF inflammatory biomarkers decreased in treated participants (p < 0.05) post-transplantation. CSF monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels correlated with ALSFRS-R slope improvement up to 24 weeks (p < 0.05). Conclusion A single-dose transplantation of MSC-NTF cells is safe and demonstrated early promising signs of efficacy. This establishes a clear path forward for a multidose randomized clinical trial of intrathecal autologous MSC-NTF cell transplantation in ALS. Classification of evidence This phase II study provides Class I evidence.

W.; Cleton-Jansen, Anne-Marie			An osteosarcoma zebrafish model implicates Mmp-19 and Ets-1 as well as reduced host immune response in angiogenesis and migration	JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY												About 40% of osteosarcoma patients die of metastases. Novel strategies to improve treatment of metastatic patients require a better understanding of the processes involved, like angiogenesis, migration, and the immune response. However, the rarity of osteosarcoma and its heterogeneity make this neoplasm difficult to study. Recently we reported malignant transformation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which formed osteosarcoma upon transplantation into mice. Here we studied these cells in zebrafish embryos and found that transformed MSCs induced angiogenesis and migrated through the bodies of the embryos, but this was never observed with non-transformed normal MSCs (progenitors of the transformed MSCs). Whole genome expression analysis of both the cells and the host showed that angiogenesis and migration-related genes matrix metalloproteinase 19 (Mmp-19) and erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue 1 (Ets-1) were overexpressed in transformed MSCs compared to normal MSCs. Investigating the host response, embryos injected with transformed MSCs showed decreased expression of immune response-related genes, especially major histocompatibility complex class 1 (mhc1ze), as compared to embryos injected with normal MSCs. These findings contribute to the identification of genetic events involved in angiogenesis, migration, and host response providing targets as well as an appropriate model for high-throughput drug screens.

The high plasticity probably is the main reason for the high variety in phenotypes of chordoma, from its high heterogeneity on a cellular level to its subtype variations depending on tissue location, with its potential to develop from an inactive quiescent form to an aggressive cancer with extreme adaptability and resistance to drugs and other treatments. Gene expression profiles of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skull chordoma, spine chordoma, and normal tissue specimens were generated and compared. Using strict criteria, we identified 222 differentially expressed transcripts unique to skull base chordoma, 261 unique to spine chordoma, and 192 common to both chordoma subtypes. Further analysis of these three groups of transcripts allowed the selection of three subsets of highly differentially expressed genes as potential biomarkers, disease drivers, and therapeutic targets in both chordoma subtypes. Immunohistochemistry revealed LMX1A to be dominant in skull base chordoma, SALL3 to be unique to spine chordoma, and T to be common to both chordoma subtypes. In both chordoma subtypes, the genes with the highest expression were predominantly development-related genes, mostly transcription factors. Our findings indicate that these developmental genes play important oncogenic roles in chordoma, mainly causing high plasticity and resistance to therapy in both these cancer subtypes but also determining their differentiation status and proliferation activity, pointing to features expected of heterogeneous stem cell-like tissues with similarities to their notochord origins.

BLIMP1 Induces Transient Metastatic Heterogeneity in Pancreatic Cancer	CANCER DISCOVERY												Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most metastatic and deadly cancers. Despite the clinical signifi cance of metastatic spread, our understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive PDAC metastatic ability remains limited. By generating a genetically engineered mouse model of human PDAC, we uncover a transient subpopulation of cancer cells with exceptionally high metastatic ability. Global gene expression profi ling and functional analyses uncovered the transcription factor BLIMP1 as a driver of PDAC metastasis. The highly metastatic PDAC subpopulation is enriched for hypoxia-induced genes, and hypoxia-mediated induction of BLIMP1 contributes to the regulation of a subset of hypoxia-associated gene expression programs. These fi ndings support a model in which upregulation of BLIMP1 links microenvironmental cues to a metastatic stem cell character. SIGNIFICANCE: PDAC is an almost uniformly lethal cancer, largely due to its tendency for metastasis.

The current treatment of choice comprises wide resection in combination with multimodal chemotherapy including etoposide (Eto). Due to the serious side effects associated with common chemotherapeutics and prevalent multidrug resistance in recurrent and metastatic ES, there is a growing demand for alternative strategies and add-on drugs. Previous research has demonstrated efficient cell death induction by Eto in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO) in ES cell lines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different temporal sequences of ATO and Eto administration on apoptosis induction and to explore the effect of both drugs on inhibitory glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3-beta) phosphorylation as well as multidrug transporter gene expression. The intensity of caspase activation was mainly determined by the Eto doses in A673 and TC-71 cells, whereas in RD-ES cells ATO application actively suppressed Eto-induced apoptosis. This coincided with an increase in inhibitory GSK-3 beta phosphorylation in ATO-treated RD-ES cells. Inherent mRNA expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) was low in the ES cell lines compared to that observed in the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), whereas multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) gene expression was considerably increased in the ES cell lines. ATO treatment reduced MRP1 mRNA expression in the A673 and TC-71 cells, while expression was induced in the MSC and RD-ES cells. In contrast, MDR1 mRNA expression was specifically induced by ATO in the A673 and TC-71 cells, reinforcing the expression differences between MSC and the ES cell lines. Although a reliable cell death induction by the combination of ATO and Eto has been previously shown in ES cell lines, the present study showed marked heterogeneity of the ES cell response to ATO and Eto treatment, illustrating the difficulty of prediction of individual treatment outcome in ES.

However, it has proven difficult to develop protocols for their purification and characterization. One of the major barriers in the field has been a lack of convenient assays for their bioactivity. Developing assays has not been a trivial matter, because of the heterogeneity of EVs, the multiple activities they demonstrate, and the uncertainty about their modes of action. Therefore, it is likely that multiple assays for their activities are needed. One important assay will be for the anti-inflammatory activity observed in mice after administration of the small EVs commonly referred to as exosomes. We developed an assay for the anti-inflammatory activity of exosomes with a line of mouse macrophages. The assay makes it possible to rank different preparations of exosomes by their anti-inflammatory activity, and their ranking predicts their efficacy in suppressing LPS-stimulated inflammation in mice. The assay is convenient for comparing multiple samples and, therefore, should be useful in developing protocols for the purification and characterization of anti-inflammatory exosomes.

Although its histogenesis and biological aspects remain poorly understood, previous studies have postulated that this tumor may arise from single cancer stem cells which subsequently differentiate into distinct tumor lineages. In this study, we explored a wide array of mutational hot spot regions, through high-depth next-generation sequencing of 47 cancer-associated genes in order to assess the mutational landscape of these tumors and investigate whether the epithelial and mesenchymal components shared the same genetic signatures. Results from this study confirm that despite their striking phenotypic differences, both elements of this infrequent tumor indeed share a common clonal origin. Additionally, CCS appears to embrace a heterogeneous spectrum with specific underlying molecular signatures correlating with the defining epithelial morphotype, with those carcinosarcomas exhibiting a squamous cell carcinoma epithelial component exhibiting diverse point mutations and deletions in the TP53 gene, and those with a basal cell carcinoma morphotype revealing a more complex mutational landscape involving several genes. Also, the fact that our findings involve several targetable gene pathways suggests that the underlying molecular events driving the pathogenesis of CCS may represent future potential targets for personalized therapies.

While Twist1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), here we show that Tkvist1 overexpression enhances nuclear and mitotic aberrations. This is accompanied by an increase in whole chromosomal copy number gains and losses, underscoring the role of Twist1 in inducing chromosomal instability (CIN) in colorectal cancer cells. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis further shows sub-chromosomal deletions, consistent with an increased frequency of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Remarkably, Twist1 overexpression downmodulates key cell cycle checkpoint factors-Bub1, BubR1, Mad1 and Mad2-that regulate CIN. Mathematical simulations using the RACIPE tool show a negative correlation of Twist1 with E-cadherin and BubR1. Data analyses of gene expression profiles of patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TOGA) reveal a positive correlation between Twist1 and mesenchymal genes across cancers, whereas the correlation of TWIST1 with CIN and DSB genes is cancer subtype-specific. Taken together, these studies highlight the mechanistic involvement of Twist1 in the deregulation of factors that maintain genome stability during EMT in colorectal cancer cells. Twist1 overexpression enhances genome instability in the context of EMT that further contributes to cellular heterogeneity. In addition, these studies imply that Twist1 downmodulates nuclear lamins that further alter spatiotemporal organization of the cancer genome and epigenome. Notwithstanding their genetic background, colorectal cancer cells nevertheless maintain their overall ploidy, while the downstream effects of Twist1 enhance CIN and DNA damage enriching for sub-populations of aggressive cancer cells.

Preservation of the 3D Phenotype Upon Dispersal of Cultured Cell Spheroids Into Monolayer Cultures	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY												In functional cytometric studies, cultured cells are exposed to effectors (e.g., drugs), and the heterogeneity of cell responses are studied using cytometry techniques (e.g., image cytometry). Such studies are difficult to perform on 3D cell cultures. A solution is to disperse 3D clusters and transfer the cells to the 2D state before applying effectors and using cytometry. This approach requires that the lifetime of the 3D phenotype be longer than the duration of the experiment. Here we studied the dynamics of phenotype transformation from 3D to 2D and searched for means of slowing this transformation down in dispersed spheroids of MCF7 cells. We found three functional biomarkers of the 3D phenotype in MCF7 cell spheroids that are absent in the 2D cell culture: (i) the presence of a subpopulation with an elevated drug-expelling capacity; (ii) the presence of a subpopulation with an elevated cytoprotective capacity; and (iii) the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Monitoring these biomarkers in cells transferred from the 3D state to the 2D state revealed their gradual extinction. We found that the combined application of an elevated cell density and thiol-containing medium supplements increased the lifetime of the 3D phenotype by several fold to as long as 96h. Our results suggest that extending the lifetime of the 3D phenotype in the cells transferred from the 3D state to the 2D state can facilitate detailed functional cytometric studies, such as measurements of population heterogeneity of cytotoxicity, chemosensitivity, and radiosensitivity.

The major challenges in overcoming the poor prognosis with this disease include late detection and the aggressive biology of the disease. Intratumoral heterogeneity; presence of a robust, reactive, and desmoplastic stroma; and the crosstalk between the different tumor components require complete understanding of the pancreatic tumor biology to better understand the therapeutic challenges posed by this disease.

However, it remains unclear whether DFCs can maintain stem cell characteristics, or mediate tissue-regeneration to form single or complex tissues in the periodontium, after long-term culturing. Therefore, DFCs were isolated from human impacted molars (HIM-DFCs), passaged > 30 times, and then evaluated for their heterogeneity and multipotential differentiation. Morphology, proliferation, epitope profile, and mineralization characteristics of clones derived from single HIM-DFCs in vitro were also assayed. HIM-DFCs (passage #30) were found to be positive for the heterogeneous markers, Notch-1, stro-1, alkaline phosphomonoesterase (ALP), type I collagen (COL-I), type III collagen (COL-III), and osteocalcine. Moreover, passage #30 of the HDF1, 2, and 3 subclone classes identified in this study were found to express high levels of the mesenchymal stem cells markers, CD146 and Stro1. HDF3 subclones were also associated with the strongest ALP staining detected, and strongly expressed osteoblast and cementoblast markers, including COL-I, COL-III, bone sialoprotein (BSP), and Runx2. In contrast, HDF1 subclone analyzed strongly expressed COL-I and COL-III, yet weakly expressed BSP and Runx2. The HDF2 subclone was associated with the strongest proliferative capacity. To evaluate differentiation characteristics in vivo, these various cell populations were combined with ceramic bovine bone and implanted into subcutaneous pockets of nude mice. The 30th passage of subclone HDF1 and 3 were observed to contribute to fiber collagens and the mineralized matrix present, respectively, whereas HDF2 subclones were found to have a minimal role in these formations. The formation of a cementum-periodontal ligament (PDL) complex was observed 6 weeks after HIM-DFCs (passage #30) were implanted in vivo, thus suggesting that these cells maintain stem cell characteristics. Therefore, subclone HDF1-3 may be related to the differentiation of fibroblasts in the PDL, undifferentiated cells, and osteoblasts and cementoblasts, respectively. Overall, this study is the first to amplify HIM-DFCs and associated subclones with the goal of reconstructing complex or single periodontium. Moreover, our results demonstrate the potential for this treatment approach to address periodontal defects that result from periodontitis, or for the regeneration of teeth.

As a fabrication strategy 3D printing overcomes the geometric limitations associated with classical heart valve tissue engineering scaffold assembly strategies. Experiments were conducted to establish photoencapsulation and fabrication parameter ranges tolerated by valve and mesenchymal stem cells, thereby enabling direct cell-hydrogel printing with optimal capacity for geometric control. Additionally, a dynamic conditioning system was designed specifically for the culture of 3D bioprinted valves. These studies indicate that bioprinted valves with encapsulated mesenchymal stem cells can be produced with high viability for the purposes of a tissue engineered heart valve or with primary aortic valve cells for the purpose of in vitro testing and mechanistic studies.

CD44 Facilitates Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Phenotypic Change at Acquisition of Resistance to EGFR Kinase Inhibitors in Lung Cancer	MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in lung cancers. Because EMT is related to tumor invasion, metastases, and resistance to various treatments, it is important to prevent the emergence of EMT. However, molecular mechanism(s) underlying EMT pheno-typic changes, as well as biomarker(s) that predict the emergence of EMT in EGFR-mutated lung cancers, are unclear to date. Through the comparison of expression data between isogenic lung cancer cell lines that acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI(s), we identified that high CD44 expression is related to a mesenchymal phenotype and that shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD44 reversed the EMT change. High membranous CD44 expression was identified in lesions with mesenchymal phenotype that were obtained from lung cancer patients who developed acquired resis-tance to gefitinib or afatinib, whereas isogenic lesions without EMT change showed negative/weak staining for CD44. Immunohistochemistry for treatment-naive lung cancer cell lines with EGFR mutations found those that acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs via EMT (HCC4006 and H1975 cells) had strong membranous CD44 expression compared with non-EMT-transforming lines which demonstrated negative or weak staining (Fisher exact test P value = 0.036). shRNA-mediated CD44 knockdown in HCC4006 cells prevented the emergence of EMT after chronic exposure to osimertinib. These results suggest that upregulation of CD44 facilitates EMT-phenotypic change in lung cancers with EGFR mutations when treated with EGFR-TKIs. In addition, our results suggest that CD44 can be a useful biomarker to predict the emergence of EMT upon EGFR-TKI mono-therapy. (C) 2018 AACR.

It is well known that pericytes from different organs may have distinct embryonic sources. Yamazaki et al. (2017) using several transgenic mouse model reveal by cell-lineage tracing that pericytes are even more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. This study shows that pericytes from within the same tissue may be heterogeneous in their origin. Remarkably, a subpopulation of embryonic dermal pericytes derives from the hematopoietic lineage, an unexpected source. Reconstructing the lineage of pericytes is central to understanding development, and also for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in which pericytes play important roles.

In addition the high phenotypic plasticity of MSC population makes it enormously sensitive to any changes in environmental properties including fluctuation in oxygen concentration. We have shown here that lowering oxygen level far below air atmosphere has a beneficial impact on various parameters characteristic for umbilical cord Wharton Jelly- (WJ-) MSC and adipose tissue- (AD-) derived MSC cultures. This includes their cellular composition, rate of proliferation, and maintenance of stemness properties together with commitment to cell differentiation toward mesodermal and neural lineages. In addition, the culture genomic stability increased significantly during long-term cell passaging and eventually protected cells against spontaneous transformation. Also by comparing of two routinely used methods of MSCs isolation (mechanical versus enzymatic) we have found substantial divergence arising between cell culture properties increasing along the time of cultivation in vitro. Thus, in this paper we highlight the urgent necessity to develop the more sensitive and selective methods for prediction and control cells fate and functioning during the time of growth in vitro.

Heterogeneous microenvironmental stiffness regulates pro-metastatic functions of breast cancer cells	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												Besides molecular and phenotypic variations observed in cancer cells, intratumoral heterogeneity also oc-curs in the tumor microenvironment. Correlative stiffness maps of different intratumor locations in breast tumor biopsies show that stiffness increases from core to periphery. However, how different local ECM stiffness regulates key functions of cancer cells in tumor progression remains unclear. Although increased tissue stiffness is an established driver of breast cancer progression, conclusions from 2D cultures do not correspond with newer data from cancer cells in 3D environments. Many past studies of breast can-cer in 3D culture fail to recapitulate the stiffness of a real breast tumor or the various local stiffnesses present in a tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a series of collagen/alginate hybrid hydrogels with adjustable stiffness to match the core, middle, and peripheral zones of a breast tumor. We used this hydrogel system to investigate effects of different local stiffness on morphology, prolifer-ation, and migration of breast cancer cells. RNA sequencing of cells in hydrogels with different stiffness revealed changes in multiple cellular processes underlying cancer progression, including angiogenesis and metabolism. We discovered that tumor cells in a soft environment enriched YAP1 and AP1 signaling re-lated genes, whereas tumor cells in a stiff environment became more pro-angiogenic by upregulating fibronectin 1 (FN1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. This systematic study defines how the range of environmental stiffnesses present in a breast tumor regulates cancer cells, providing new insights into tumorigenesis and disease progression at the tumor-stroma interface. Statement of significance Applied a well-defined hybrid hydrogel system to mimic the tumor microenvironment with hetero-geneous local stiffness. Breast cancer cells tended to proliferate in soft core environment while mi-grate in stiff peripheral environment. Breast cancer cells shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS and fatty acid metabolism responding to stiff matrix microenvironment. The transcriptomic profile of breast cancer cells altered due to microenvironmental stiffness changes. (c) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Caner initiating cells (CICs), which are responsible for tumor growth and coupled with gain of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), have been identified. Previously, we enriched a subpopulation of head and neck cancer initiating cells (HN-CICs) with up-regulation of CD133 and enhancement of EMT. Others demonstrate that Src kinase interacts with and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of CD133. However, the physiological function of CD133/Src signaling in HNSCCs has not been uncovered. Methodology/Principal Finding: Herein, we determined the critical role of CD133/Src axis modulating stemness, EMT and tumorigenicity of HNSCC and HN-CICs. Initially, down-regulation of CD133 significantly reduced the self-renewal ability and expression of stemness genes, and promoted the differentiation and apoptotic capability of HN-CICs. Additionally, knockdown of CD133 in HN-CICs also lessened both in vitro malignant properties including cell migration/cell invasiveness/anchorage independent growth, and in vivo tumor growth by nude mice xenotransplantation assay. In opposite, overexpression of CD133 enhanced the stemness properties and tumorigenic ability of HNSCCs. Lastly, up-regulation of CD133 increased phosphorylation of Src coupled with EMT transformation in HNSCCs, on the contrary, silence of CD133 or treatment of Src inhibitor inversely abrogated above phenotypic effects, which were induced by CD133 up-regulation in HNSCCs or HN-CICs. Conclusion/Significance: Our results suggested that CD133/Src signaling is a regulatory switch to gain of EMT and of stemness properties in HNSCC.

The pediatric cancer neuroblastoma includes adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES) tumor cell types, which differ in phenotype, super-enhancers (SEs) and core regulatory circuitries. These cell types can spontaneously interconvert, but the mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we unravel how a NOTCH3 intracellular domain reprogrammed the ADRN transcriptional landscape towards a MES state. A transcriptional feed-forward circuitry of NOTCH-family transcription factors amplifies the NOTCH signaling levels, explaining the swift transition between two semi-stable cellular states. This transition induces genome-wide remodeling of the H3K27ac landscape and a switch from ADRN SEs to MES SEs. Once established, the NOTCH feed-forward loop maintains the induced MES state. In vivo reprogramming of ADRN cells shows that MES and ADRN cells are equally oncogenic. Our results elucidate a swift transdifferentiation between two semi-stable epigenetic cellular states.

An in vitro 3D model using collagen coated gelatin nanofibers for studying breast cancer metastasis	BIOFABRICATION												The study of breast cancer metastasis is limited due to poor knowledge of molecular progression of breast tumor and varied heterogeneity. For a better understanding of tumor metastasis, a reliable 3D in vitro model bridging the gap between 2D cultures and in vivo animal model studies is essential. Our study is focused on two key points: (i) designing a 3D microenvironment for studying metastasis and (ii) simulating the metastasis milieu by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). An electrospun gelatin nanofiber matrix (EGNF) was fabricated using electrospinning and further dip coated with different concentrations of collagen to obtain surface complexity and mechanical properties, similar to connective tissues. Nanofiber matrices were physically characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The FTIR, AFM, and FESEM results indicated the crosslinking and confirmed the presence of pores in the nanofiber matrices. Comparative studies on biocompatibility, cell attachment, and the proliferation of MCF-7 cells on EGNF and collagen coated gelatin nanofibrous matrix (CCGM) revealed higher cellular attachment and proliferation in CCGM. CCGM with human metastatic breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was taken to study breast cancer metastasis using estrogen (induces EMT) and progesterone (induces MET) hormones for 24 h. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for quantifying the expression of metastasis related genes, and fluorescence microscopy for verifying the invasion of cells to the matrices. The expression of E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) confirmed the occurrence of EMT and MET. Live cell imaging and cellular attachment showed significant increase of cellular invasion in crosslinked 0.15% CCGM that serves as a suitable non-toxic, biocompatible, and affordable scaffold for studying breast cancer metastasis. Our findings suggested that CCGM can be used as a tissue-like 3D model for studying breast cancer metastatic events in vitro.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis of lineage diversity in high-grade glioma	GENOME MEDICINE												Background: Despite extensive molecular characterization, we lack a comprehensive understanding of lineage identity, differentiation, and proliferation in high grade gliomas (HGGs). Methods: We sampled the cellular milieu of HGGs by profiling dissociated human surgical specimens with a high density microwell system for massively parallel single cell RNA Seq. We analyzed the resulting profiles to identify subpopulations of both HGG and microenvironmental cells and applied graph based methods to infer structural features of the malignantly transformed populations. Results: While HGG cells can resemble glia or even immature neurons and form blanched lineage structures, mesenchymal transformation results in unstructured populations. Glioma cells in a subset of mesenchymal tumors lose their neural lineage identity, express inflammatory genes, and co-exist with marked myeloid infiltration, reminiscent of molecular inter actions between glioma and immune cells established in animal models. Additionally, we discovered a tight coupling between lineage resemblance and proliferation among malignantly transformed cells Glioma cells that resemble oligodendrocyte progenitors, which proliferate in the brain, are often found in the cell cycle Conversely, glioma cells that resemble astrocytes, neuroblasts, and oligodendrocytes, which are non proliferative in the brain, are generally non cycling in tumors. Conclusions: These studies reveal a relationship between cellular identity and proliferation in HGG and distinct population structures that reflects the extent of neural and non-neural lineage resemblance among malignantly transformed cells.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a tumorigenic programme through which cells acquire mesenchymal, more pro-oncogenic phenotype. The reversible phenotype switching is an event still not completely understood in melanoma. The EMT features and increased invasiveness are associated with lower levels of the pivotal lineage identity maintaining and melanoma-specific transcription factor MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), whereas increased proliferation is linked to higher MITF levels. However, the precise role of MITF in phenotype switching is still loosely characterized. To exclude the changes occurring upstream of MITF during MITF regulation invivo, we employed a model whereby MITF expression was inducibly regulated by shRNA in melanoma cell lines. We found that the decrease in MITF caused only moderate attenuation of proliferation of the whole cell line population. Proliferation was decreased in five of 15 isolated clones, in three of them profoundly. Reduction in MITF levels alone did not generally produce EMT-like characteristics. The stem cell marker levels also did not change appreciably, only a sharp increase in SOX2 accompanied MITF down-regulation. Oppositely, the downstream differentiation markers and the MITF transcriptional targets melastatin and tyrosinase were profoundly decreased, as well as the downstream target livin. Surprisingly, after the MITF decline, invasiveness was not appreciably affected, independently of proliferation. The results suggest that low levels of MITF may still maintain relatively high proliferation and might reflect, rather than cause, the EMT-like changes occurring in melanoma.

We submit that greater adoption of these critical resources will be promoted by the provision of a suitably-sized, meaningfully-described reference collection along with appropriate tools for working with them. Consequently, we present a curated panel of 12 readily-usable, genetically-diverse, tumourigenic, patient-derived, low-passage, serum-free cell lines representing the spectrum of molecular subtypes of IDH-wildtype GBM along with their detailed phenotypic characterisation plus a bespoke set of lentiviral plasmids for bioluminescent/fluorescent labelling, gene expression and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation. The cell lines and all accompanying data are readily-accessible via a single website, Q-Cell (qimrberghofer.edu.au/q-cell/) and all plasmids are available from Addgene.

The worst prognostic subtype has been defined by genes associated with stem-like biology. Recently, it has been shown that the majority of genes associated with this poor prognostic group are stromal derived. We investigated the potential for tumor misclassification into multiple diagnostic subgroups based on tumoral region sampled. Experimental Design: We performed multiregion tissue RNA extraction/transcriptomic analysis using colorectal-specific arrays on invasive front, central tumor, and lymph node regions selected from tissue samples from 25 colorectal cancer patients. Results: We identified a consensus 30-gene list, which represents the intratumoral heterogeneity within a cohort of primary colorectal cancer tumors. Using a series of online datasets, we showed that this gene list displays prognostic potential HR = 2.914 (confidence interval 0.9286-9.162) in stage II/III colorectal cancer patients, but in addition, we demonstrated that these genes are stromal derived, challenging the assumption that poor prognosis tumors with stem-like biology have undergone a widespread epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Most importantly, we showed that patients can be simultaneously classified into multiple diagnostically relevant subgroups based purely on the tumoral region analyzed. Conclusions: Gene expression profiles derived from the nonmalignant stromal region can influence assignment of colorectal cancer transcriptional subtypes, questioning the current molecular classification dogma and highlighting the need to consider pathology sampling region and degree of stromal infiltration when employing transcription-based classifiers to underpin clinical decision making in colorectal cancer.

We have recently shown that these large cancer cells are not only viable but also can divide asymmetrically and yield progeny cancer cells with cancer stem-like properties via budding division. To further understand the molecular events involved in the regulation of PGCCs and the generation of their progeny cancer cells, we comparatively analyzed the proteomic profiles of PGCCs, PGCCs with budding daughter cells, and regular control cancer cells from the HEY and SKOv3 human ovarian cancer cell lines with and without CoCl2. We used a high-throughput iTRAQ-based proteomic methodology coupled with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy to determine the differentiated regulated proteins. We performed Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses to validate the differences in the expression patterns of a variety of proteins between PGCCs or budding PGCCs and regular cancer cells identified by iTRAQ approach and also a selected group of proteins from the literature. The differentially regulated proteins included proteins involved in response to hypoxia, stem cell generation, chromatin remodeling, cell-cycle regulation, and invasion and metastasis. In particular, we found that HIF-1alpha and its known target STC1 are upregulated in PGCCs. In addition, we found that a panel of stem cell-regulating factors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition regulatory transcription factors were upregulated in budding PGCCs, whereas expression of the histone 1 family of nucleosomal linker proteins was consistently lower in PGCCs than in control cells. Thus, proteomic expression patterns provide valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of PGCC formation and the relationship between PGCCs and cancer stem cells in patients with ovarian cancers.																	1932-6203					NOV 14	2013	8	11							e80120	10.1371/journal.pone.0080120							WOS:000327143800125	24348907

Aims The aims are to assess efficacy of bone marrow stromal cell therapy for ischemic stroke in animal studies. Methods Randomized controlled animal trials assessing efficacy of bone marrow stromal cell therapy were eligible. Stroke therapy academic industry round table was used to assess methodologic quality of included studies. Primary outcomes were total infarction volume and modified Neurological Severity Score. Multiple prespecified sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were conducted. Random effects models were used for meta-analysis. Results Thirty-three randomized animal trials were included with a total of 796 animals. The median quality score was 6 (interquartile range, 5-7). Bone marrow stromal cell therapy decreased total infarction volume (standardized mean difference, 0.897; 95% confidence interval, 0.553-1.241; P<.001) at follow-up. Overall standardized mean difference between animals treated with bone marrow stromal cell and controls was 2.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.84-3.11; P<.001) for modified Neurological Severity Score; 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.82; P<.001) for adhesive removal test; and 2.13 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-3.61; P<.001) for rotarod test. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. Effect of all outcomes stayed significant in various sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses, except in a few subgroup analyses with small sample size or with short time follow-up. No significant difference between groups was observed except for study location, in which significantly larger estimates were found in Asian countries. On the basis of this meta-analysis, larger sample sizes are warranted for future animal studies. Conclusions Bone marrow stromal cell therapy significantly decreased total infarction volume and increased neural functional recovery in randomized controlled animal models of ischemic stroke.

FAP Delineates Heterogeneous and Functionally Divergent Stromal Cells in Immune-Excluded Breast Tumors	CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH												Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are generally associated with poor clinical outcome. CAFs support tumor growth in a variety of ways and can suppress antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy. However, a precise understanding of CAF contributions to tumor growth and therapeutic response is lacking. Discrepancies in this field of study may stem from heterogeneity in the composition and function of fibroblasts in the tumor micro-environment. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether CAFs directly interact with and suppress T cells. Here, mouse and human breast tumors were used to examine stromal cells expressing fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a surface marker for CAFs. Two discrete populations of FAP thorn mesenchymal cells were identified on the basis of podoplanin (PDPN) expression: a FAP(+) PDPN+ population of CAFs and a FAP(+) PDPN- population of cancer-associated pericytes (CAPs). Although both subsets expressed extracellular matrix molecules, the CAF transcriptome was enriched in genes associated with TGF beta signaling and fibrosis compared with CAPs. In addition, CAFs were enriched at the outer edge of the tumor, in close contact with T cells, whereas CAPs were localized around vessels. Finally, FAP thorn PDPN thorn CAFs suppressed the proliferation of T cells in a nitric oxide-dependent manner, whereas FAP(+) PDPN- pericytes were not immunosuppressive. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that breast tumors contain multiple populations of FAP-expressing stromal cells of dichotomous function, phenotype, and location.

First passage hMSCs exhibited growth rates in vitro that varied up to 12-fold between donors. No correlation between growth rate and the age or gender of the donor was evident (P less than or equal to 0.05). When hMSCs were cultured without passage for eight days (subconfluent cultures) or 22 days (confluent cultures) in the absence of any osteogenic agonists, levels of alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity varied 40-fold and 10-fold, respectively, between donors. When exposed to osteo-inductive media, donor populations also showed dramatic differences in levels of bone-specific gene induction. Collectively, these data demonstrate that hMSC cultures are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells at various stages of differentiation and with distinct osteogenic potentials. Differences in both growth rate and ALP activity were evident in hMSC cultures Established from multiple aspirates obtained over a six month period from the same donors. Therefore, it appears that cellular heterogeneity produced by the method of harvest is propagated within and among different donor populations during culture expansion in vitro. J. Cell.

Bioelectric modulation of wound healing in a 3D in vitro model of tissue-engineered bone	BIOMATERIALS												Long-standing interest in bioelectric regulation of bone fracture healing has primarily focused on exogenous stimulation of bone using applied electromagnetic fields. Endogenous electric signals, such as spatial gradients of resting potential among non-excitable cells in vivo, have also been shown to be important in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and tissue regeneration, and may therefore have as-yet unexplored therapeutic potential for regulating wound healing in bone tissue. To study this form of bioelectric regulation, there is a need for three-dimensional (3D) in vitro wound tissue models that can overcome limitations of current in vivo models. We present a 3D wound healing model in engineered bone tissue that serves as a pre-clinical experimental platform for studying electrophysiological regulation of wound healing. Using this system, we identified two electrophysiology-modulating compounds, glibenclamide and monensin, that augmented osteoblast mineralization. Of particular interest, these compounds displayed differential effects in the wound area compared to the surrounding tissue. Several hypotheses are proposed to account for these observations, including the existence of heterogeneous subpopulations of osteoblasts that respond differently to bioelectric signals, or the capacity of the wound-specific biochemical and biomechanical environment to alter cell responses to electrophysiological treatments. These data indicate that a comprehensive characterization of the cellular, biochemical, biomechanical, and bioelectrical components of in vitro wound models is needed to develop bioelectric strategies to control cell functions for improved bone regeneration.

Three-dimensional Micro-culture System for Tooth Tissue Engineering	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH												The arrangement of cells within a tissue plays an essential role in organogenesis, including tooth development. Progress is being made to regenerate teeth by reassociating dissociated embryonic dental cells and implanting them in vivo. In the present study, we tested the hanging drop method to study mixed epithelial-mesenchymal cell reorganization in a liquid instead of semisolid medium to see whether it could lead to tooth histogenesis and organogenesis. This method allowed the control of the proportion and number of cells to be used, and the forming microtissues showed homogeneous size. The liquid environment favored cell migrations as compared with collagen gels. Three protocols were compared. The one that sequentially combined the hanging drop and semisolid medium cultures prior to in vivo implantation gave the best results. Indeed, after implantation, teeth developed, showing a well-formed crown, mineralization of dentin and enamel, and the initiation of root formation. Vascularization and the cellular heterogeneity in the mesenchyme were similar to what was observed in developing molars. Finally, after coimplantation with a trigeminal ganglion, the dental mesenchyme, including the odontoblast layer, became innervated. The real advantage of this technique is the small number of cells required to make a tooth. This experimental model can be employed to study the development, physiology, metabolism, or toxicology in forming teeth and test other cell sources.

The importance of circulating and disseminated tumor cells in pancreatic cancer	SURGERY OPEN SCIENCE												Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease in a large part due to the systemic nature at the time of diagnosis. In those patients who undergo a potentially curative resection of pancreatic cancer, the overwhelming majority will have systemic relapse. Circulating tumor cells are an important mediator of the development of metastases. Circulating tumor cells have been identified in patients with clinically localized resectable pancreatic cancer and exist as several phenotypes. Mesenchymal and stem cell-like phenotypes of circulating tumor cells predict early recurrence and worse survival. This review focuses on the current understanding of circulating tumor cells in pancreatic cancer and how this information can be used in developing more effective therapy in the future.

However variety of MSC sources and general heterogeneity lead to controversial data in functional characterization. Furthermore, despite intensive usage as preclinical animal model, little is known about MSCs of the common marmoset monkey. Methods: MSCs derived from placental amnion and bone marrow samples from human and common marmoset were characterized in parallel over 12 passages to monitor similarities and significant differences (p <= 0.05, Student's t-test) in MSC markers and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, metabolic activity test, with special focus on pluripotency associated genes. Results: Human and non-human primate MSCs were characterized for expression of MSC markers and capability of differentiation into mesenchymal lineages. MSCs could be cultured more than 100 days (26 passages), but metabolic activity was significantly enhanced in amnion vs. bone marrow MSCs. Interestingly, MHC class I expression is significantly reduced in amnion MSCs until passage 6 in human and marmoset, but not in bone marrow cells. For MSC markers, CD73 and CD105 levels remain unchanged in amnion MSCs and slightly decline in bone marrow at late passages; CD166 is significantly higher expressed in human MSCs, CD106 significantly lower vs. marmoset. All cultured MSCs showed pluripotency marker expression like Oct-4A at passage 3 significantly decreasing over time (passages 6-12) while Nanog expression was highest in human bone marrow MSCs. Furthermore, human MSCs demonstrated the highest Sox2 levels vs. marmoset, whereas the marmoset exhibited significantly higher Lin28A values. Bisulfite sequencing of the Oct-4 promoter region displayed fewer methylations of CpG islands in the marmoset vs. human. Conclusions: Little is known about MSC characteristics from the preclinical animal model common marmoset vs. human during long term culture. Studied human and common marmoset samples share many similar features such as most MSC markers and reduced MHC class I expression in amnion cells vs. bone marrow. Furthermore, pluripotency markers indicate in both species a subpopulation of MSCs with true 'stemness', which could explain their high proliferation capacity, though possessing differences between human and marmoset in Lin28A and Sox2 expression.

Evidence of lateral transmission of aggressive features between different types of breast cancer cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY												Breast cancer (BrC) is a major public health problem worldwide. The intra-tumoral heterogeneity and tumor cell plasticity importantly contribute to disease progression and treatment failure. However, the dynamic interactions between different tumor clones, as well as their contribution to tumor aggressiveness are still poorly understood. In this study, we provide evidence of a lateral transmission of aggressive features between aggressive and non-aggressive tumor cells, consisting of gain of expression of cancer stem cell markers, increased expression of CXCL12 receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 and increased invasiveness in response to CXCL12, which correlated with high levels of secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-8 and metalloproteinases 1 and 2 by the aggressive cells. Noteworthy, we found no evidence of a TGF-beta participation in the inducible-invasive phenotype. Altogether, our results provide evidence of communication between tumor cells with different potentials for aggressiveness, which could influence intra-tumoral population dynamics promoting the emergence of clones with novel functions. Understanding these interactions will provide better targets for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategies.

J	Kalcheim, C; Kumar, D				Kalcheim, Chaya; Kumar, Deepak			Cell fate decisions during neural crest ontogeny	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												The neural crest (NC) originates in the central nervous system (CNS) primordium. Born as an epithelium, NC progenitors undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that generates cellular movement away from the CNS. Mesenchymal NC progenitors then migrate through stereotypic pathways characteristic of various axial levels until homing to distinct primordia where phenotypic differentiation takes place. Being the source of most of the peripheral nervous system, pigment cells and ectomesenchyme, the embryonic NC is considered to be a multipotent population of precursors. In spite of numerous recent studies, an essential and still unsolved question is when during ontogeny do the different lineages segregate from putative homogeneous and multipotent progenitors. Evidence suggests that the premigratory NC still resident in the dorsal neural tube epithelium is composed both of multipotent as well as of fate-restricted precursors, supporting the notion of an early appearance of cellular heterogeneity. Understanding these changing states of commitment is a prerequisite for deciphering molecular mechanisms that regulate fate segregation of the embryonic NC. In this review, we present data illustrating the existence of progenitors harboring different states of specification and their emergence as a function of time and space.

The mixture of neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells that remain after surgery form the biological context for adjuvant therapeutic intervention and recurrence. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and histological analysis on radiographically guided biopsies taken from different regions of GBM and showed that the tissue contained within the contrast-enhancing (CE) core of tumors have different cellular and molecular compositions compared with tissue from the nonenhancing (NE) margins of tumors. Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. These subtype-specific patterns provide new insights into molecular and cellular composition of the infiltrative margins of GBM.

Modeling differentiation-state transitions linked to therapeutic escape in triple-negative breast cancer	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity. Author summary Some classes of breast cancer tumors are composed of cells with different sets of observable traits, or phenotypes. The phenotype corresponds to particular cellular functionality and can arise due to the genetic/epigenetic code inside the cell, the environment outside the cell, and the genotype-environment interaction. Interestingly, treating a population of cancer cells with specific targeted therapies can stimulate changes in the phenotypic make-up of the population, contributing to resistance against the drug. Previous studies have indicated that changes in phenotypic composition of cancer cell populations might be caused by cells transitioning between phenotypes, but details of the transitions are not well-understood due to lack of sufficient time series data. Using a novel data set with well-established numerical methods, the results presented here improve our understanding of the phenotypic transitions occurring between drug-treated triple-negative breast cancer cells and have the potential to inform the design of improved cancer treatment strategies.

Therefore, the further molecular characterization of isolated CTCs might have clinical relevance as liquid biopsy for therapeutic decision-making and to monitor disease progression. The direct analysis of systemic cancer appears particularly important in view of the known disparity in expression of therapeutic targets as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-based heterogeneity between primary and systemic tumor cells, which all substantially complicate monitoring and therapeutic targeting at present. Since CTCs are the potential precursor cells of metastasis, their in-depth molecular profiling should also provide a useful resource for target discovery. The present review will discuss the use of systemically spread cancer cells as liquid biopsy and focus on potential target antigens.

However, little is known about the stem/progenitor properties of transformed cells within tumors. Using the aggressive Pten/Tp53-null mouse model of prostate cancer, we show that two classes of luminal progenitors exist within a tumor. Not only did tumors contain previously described multipotent progenitors, but also a major population of committed luminal progenitors. Luminal cells, sorted directly from tumors or grown as organoids, initiated tumors of adenocarcinoma or multilineage histological phenotypes, which is consistent with luminal and multipotent differentiation potentials, respectively. Moreover, using organoids we show that the ability of luminal-committed progenitors to self-renew is a tumor-specific property, absent in benign luminal cells. Finally, a significant fraction of luminal progenitors survived in vivo castration. In all, these data reveal two luminal tumor populations with different stem/progenitor cell capacities, providing insight into prostate cancer cells that initiate tumors and can influence treatment response.

EMT state is often heterogeneous within individual tumors, though the epigenetic drivers underlying such heterogeneity remain elusive. In colon cancer, hyperactivation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling not only drives tumor initiation, but also promotes metastasis in late stage by promoting EMT program. However, it is unknown whether the intratumorally heterogeneous Wnt activity could directly drive EMT heterogeneity, and, if so, what are the underlying epigenetic driver(s). Here, by analyzing a phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous colon cancer cell line using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two distinct cell populations with positively correlated Wnt activity and EMT state. Integrative multi-omics analysis of these two cell populations revealed RUNX2 as a critical transcription factor epigenetically driving the EMT heterogeneity. Both in vitro and in vivo genetic perturbation assays validated the EMT-enhancing effect of RUNX2, which remodeled chromatin landscape and activated a panel of EMT-associated genes through binding to their promoters and/or potential enhancers. Finally, by exploring the clinical data, we showed that RUNX2 expression is positively correlated with metastasis development and poor survival of colon cancer patients, as well as patients afflicted with other types of cancer. Taken together, our work revealed RUNX2 as a new EMT-promoting epigenetic regulator in colon cancer, which may potentially serve as a prognostic marker for tumor metastasis.				; Fang, Liang/V-5019-2018	Li, Guipeng/0000-0002-3244-5499; Long, Yongkang/0000-0003-0953-7325; Fang, Liang/0000-0003-4502-1756; Cui, Huanhuan/0000-0002-6190-6135												0950-9232	1476-5594				JUL 9	2020	39	28					5152	5164		10.1038/s41388-020-1351-z		JUN 2020					WOS:000539953300003	32535615

The development of advanced structural materials with excellent biocompatibility and superior corrosion resistance in the physiological environment holds great significance. High entropy alloys (HEAs) with a huge compositional design space and outstanding mechanical and functional properties can be promising for bioimplant applications. However, microstructural heterogeneity arising from elemental segregation in these multiprinciple alloy systems is the Achilles heel in the development of next-generation HEAs. Here, we demonstrate a pathway to homogenize the microstructure of a biocompatible dual-phase HEA, comprising refractory elements, namely, MoNbTaTiZr, through severe surface deformation using stationary friction processing (SFP). The strain and temperature field during processing homogenized the elemental distribution, which was otherwise unresponsive to conventional annealing treatments. Nearly 15 min of the SFP treatment resulted in a significant elemental homogenization across dendritic and interdendritic regions, similar to a week-long annealing treatment at 1275 K. The SFP processed alloy showed a nearly six times higher biocorrosion resistance compared to its as-cast counterpart. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to investigate the nature of the oxide layer formed on the specimens. Superior corrosion behavior of the processed alloy was attributed to the formation of a stable passive layer with zirconium oxide as the primary constituent and higher hydrophobicity. Biocompatibility studies performed using the human mesenchymal stem cell line, showed higher viability for the processed HEA compared to its as-cast counterpart as well as conventional metallic biomaterials including stainless steel (SS316L) and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V).

Reengineering the Tumor Microenvironment to Alleviate Hypoxia and Overcome Cancer Heterogeneity	COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN MEDICINE												Solid tumors consist of cancer cells and stromal cells, including resident and transiting immune cells-all ensconced in an extracellular matrix (ECM)-nourished by blood vessels and drained by lymphatic vessels. The microenvironment constituents are abnormal and heterogeneous in morphology, phenotype, and physiology. Such irregularities include an inefficient tumor vascular network comprised of leaky and compressed vessels, which impair blood flowand oxygen delivery. Low oxygenation in certain tumor regions-or focal hypoxia-is a mediator of cancer progression, metastasis, immunosuppression, and treatment resistance. Thus, repairing an abnormal and heterogeneous microenvironment-and hypoxia in particular-can significantly improve treatments of solid tumors. Here, we summarize two strategies to reengineer the tumor microenvironment (TME)-vessel normalization and decompression-that can alleviate hypoxia. In addition, we discuss how these two strategies alone and in combination with each other-or other therapeutic strategies-may overcome the challenges posed by cancer heterogeneity.

Continuing Challenges in Advancing Preclinical Science in Skeletal Cell-Based Therapies and Tissue Regeneration	JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH												Cell-based therapies hold much promise for musculoskeletal medicine; however, this rapidly growing field faces a number of challenges. Few of these therapies have proven clinical benefit, and an insufficient regulatory environment has allowed for widespread clinical implementation without sufficient evidence of efficacy. The technical and biological complexity of cell-based therapies has contributed to difficulties with reproducibility and mechanistic clarity. In order to aid in addressing these challenges, we aim to clarify the key issues in the preclinical cell therapy field, and to provide a conceptual framework for advancing the state of the science. Broadly, these suggestions relate to: (i) delineating cell-therapy types and moving away from catch-all terms such as stem cell therapies; (ii) clarifying descriptions of cells and their processing; and (iii) increasing the standard of in vivo evaluation of cell-based therapy experiments to determining cell fates. Further, we provide an overview of methods for experimental evaluation, data sharing, and professional society participation that would be instrumental in advancing this field.

It is considered as a regulatory factor involved in the development of preeclampsia (PE) and cancer-associated neo-angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to describe a new sandwich ELISA for sEng quantification. In contrast to three commercial kits, the new ELISA was able to quantify sEng not only in blood plasma and cell culture supernatants, but also in urine and cerebrospinal fluid. The assay detected up to two orders of magnitude higher antigen levels than did the commercial kits. Using Western blot assay followed by SDS-PAGE or Blue Native PAGE, we demonstrated a heterogeneous nature of sEng molecules. Antigen heterogeneity is considered as a factor contributing to the pronounced differences in its content estimations by different ELISAs. We obtained evidence indicating that the assay was capable of detecting heterogenious sEng molecules. The new ELISA was validated as a quick, specific and accurate method for sEng quantification. Despite the differences in antigen content estimates, the assay had similar diagnostic performance as widely used commercial kit for the detection of severe PE in pregnant women based on plasma sEng contents. Moreover, the new assay was able to delineate diseased patients based on antigen levels in urine. Therefore, the new ELISA is a potentially valuable tool for in vitro and clinical studies.

Here, following a negative selection strategy combined with single-cell RNA sequencing of 768 transcriptomes of mesenchymal cells from a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer, we define three distinct subpopulations of CAFs. Validation at the transcriptional and protein level in several experimental models of cancer and human tumors reveal spatial separation of the CAF subclasses attributable to different origins, including the peri-vascular niche, the mammary fat pad and the transformed epithelium. Gene profiles for each CAF subtype correlate to distinctive functional programs and hold independent prognostic capability in clinical cohorts by association to metastatic disease. In conclusion, the improved resolution of the widely defined CAF population opens the possibility for biomarker-driven development of drugs for precision targeting of CAFs.

Characterizing this heterogeneity and identifying invasive phenotype may provide possibility to improve chemotherapy treatment. By mimicking cancer cell perfusion through circulatory system in metastasis, we develop a unique microfluidic cytometry (MC) platform to separate cancer cells at high throughput, and further derive a physical parameter 'transportability' to characterize the ability to pass through micro-constrictions. The transportability is determined by cell stiffness and cell-surface frictional property, and can be used to probe tumor heterogeneity, discriminate more invasive phenotypes and correlate with biomarker expressions in breast cancer cells. Decreased cell stiffness and cell-surface frictional force leads to an increase in transportability and may be a feature of invasive cancer cells by promoting cell perfusion through narrow spaces in circulatory system. The MC-Chip provides a promising microfluidic platform for studying cell mechanics and transportability could be used as a novel marker for probing tumor heterogeneity and determining invasive phenotypes.

Aim To evaluate the safety of MSC therapy in all populations receiving MSC therapy and explore the potential heterogeneities influencing the clinical application of MSCs. Methods The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched from onset until 1 March 2021. Results All adverse events are displayed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs (confidential intervals). In total, 62 randomized clinical trials were included that enrolled 3546 participants diagnosed with various diseases (approximately 20 types of diseases) treated with intravenous or local implantation versus placebo or no treatment. All studies were of high quality, and neither serious publication bias nor serious adverse events (such as death and infection) were discovered across the included studies. The pooled analysis demonstrated that MSC administration was closely associated with transient fever (OR, 3.65, 95% CI 2.05-6.49, p < 0.01), administration site adverse events (OR, 1.98, 95% CI 1.01-3.87, p = 0.05), constipation (OR, 2.45, 95% CI 1.01-5.97, p = 0.05), fatigue (OR, 2.99, 95% CI 1.06-8.44, p = 0.04) and sleeplessness (OR, 5.90, 95% CI 1.04-33.47, p = 0.05). Interestingly, MSC administration trended towards lowering rather than boosting the incidence rate of arrhythmia (OR, 0.62, 95% CI 0.36-1.07, p = 0.09). Conclusions Conclusively, MSC administration was safe in different populations compared with other placebo modalities.																		1757-6512				OCT 18	2021	12	1							545	10.1186/s13287-021-02609-x							WOS:000708497400001	34663461

To overcome this limitation, several methods are developed to fabricate microtissues with the desired 3D microenvironment. However, they tend to be time-consuming, labor-intensive, or costly, thus hindering the application of 3D microtissues as models in a wide variety of research fields. In the present study, we have developed a pressure-assisted network for droplet accumulation (PANDA) system, an easy-to-use chip that comprises a multichannel fluidic system and a hanging drop cell culture module for uniform 3D microtissue formation. This system can control the desired artificial niches for modulating the fate of the stem cells to form the different sizes of microtissue by adjusting the seeding density. Furthermore, a large number of highly consistent 3D glomerulus-like heterogeneous microtissues that are composed of kidney glomerular podocytes and mesenchymal stem cells have been formed successfully. These data suggest that the developed PANDA system can be employed as a rapid and economical platform to fabricate microtissues with tunable 3D microenvironment and cellular heterogeneity, thus can be employed as tissue-mimicking models in various biomedical research.

Although various culture systems have been developed, the long-term expansion of patient-derived tumor cells remains challenging. The present results suggested that tumor cells isolated from colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts can be efficiently immortalized in conditioned medium from irradiated feeder cells containing Y-27632, a rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Patient-derived tumor cells proliferated rapidly, reaching 90-95% confluence in 6 days. Short tandem repeat analysis suggested that these tumor tissues and cultured cells presented 13 identical short tandem repeat loci, including Amelogenin, Penta E, Penta D, D2S1338 and D19S433. Their epithelial phenotype was confirmed by staining for epithelial cell adhesion molecule and cytokeratin 20, whereas vimentin was used as a mesenchymal marker. When cells were transferred to 3D cultures, they continued to proliferate, forming well-defined tumor spheroids. Expression levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and C-Myc mRNA were increased in cultured cells. Finally, immortalized cells were used for the screening of 65 anticancer drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, allowing the identification of gene-drug associations. In the present study, primary culture models of colorectal cancer were efficiently established using a ROCK inhibitor and feeder cells, and this approach could be used for personalized treatment strategies for patients with colorectal cancer.				lee, yeo song/AAG-4342-2020													1021-335X	1791-2431				NOV	2019	42	5					2029	2038		10.3892/or.2019.7285							WOS:000490982300036	31432145

High-Throughput Screening of Surface Marker Expression on Undifferentiated and Differentiated Human Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Adipose tissue contains an abundant source of multipotent mesenchymal cells termed adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) that hold potential for regenerative medicine. However, the heterogeneity inherent to ASCs harvested using standard methodologies remains largely undefined, particularly in regards to differences across donors. Identifying the subpopulations of ASCs predisposed toward differentiation along distinct lineages holds value for improving graft survival, predictability, and efficiency. Human ASCs (hASCs) from three different donors were independently isolated by density-based centrifugation from adipose tissue and maintained in culture or differentiated along either adipogenic or osteogenic lineages using differentiation media. Undifferentiated and differentiated hASCs were then analyzed for the presence of 242 human surface markers by flow cytometry analysis. By comprehensively characterizing the surface marker profile of undifferentiated hASCs using flow cytometry, we gained novel insights into the heterogeneity underlying protein expression on the surface of cultured undifferentiated hASCs across different donors. Comparison of the surface marker profile of undifferentiated hASCs with hASCs that have undergone osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation allowed for the identification of surface markers that were upregulated and downregulated by osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. Osteogenic differentiation induced upregulation of CD164 and downregulation of CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD55, CD58, CD105, and CD166 while adipogenic differentiation induced upregulation of CD36, CD40, CD146, CD164, and CD271 and downregulation of CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD71, CD105, and CD166. These results lend support to the notion that hASCs isolated using standard methodologies represent a heterogeneous population and serve as a foundation for future studies seeking to maximize their regenerative potential through fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based selection before therapy.

The various developmental origins of SMCs such as neural crest and mesoderm result in the heterogeneity of SMCs, which plays an important role in vascular remodeling and disease development. Upon vascular injury, SMCs are exposed to blood flow and subjected to fluid shear stress. Previous studies have shown that fluid shear stress inhibits SMC proliferation. However, the effect of shear stress on the subpopulation of SMCs from specific developmental origin and vascular bed is not well understood. Here we investigated how shear stress regulates human aortic SMCs positive for neural crest markers. DNA microarray analysis showed that shear stress modulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, matrix synthesis, cell signaling, transcription and cytoskeleton organization. Further studies demonstrated that shear stress induced SMC proliferation and cyclin D1, downregulated cell cycle inhibitor p21, and activated Akt pathway. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase blocked these shear stress-induced changes. These results suggest that SMCs with neural crest characteristics may respond to shear stress in a different manner. This finding has significant implications in the remodeling and disease development of blood vessels.

This complexity is partly related to the crosstalk between tumor and its microenvironment. Endothelial cells -the building blocks of tumor vasculature-have been shown to have additional roles in cancer progression than angiogenesis and supplying oxygen and nutrients. Here, we show an alternative role for endothelial cells in supporting breast cancer growth and spreading independent of their vascular functions. Using endothelial cells and breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MCF-7, we developed co-culture systems to study the influence of tumor endothelium on breast tumor development by both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results demonstrated that endothelial cells conferred survival advantage to tumor cells under complete starvation and enriched the CD44(High) CD24(Low/-) stem cell population in tumor cells. Moreover, endothelial cells enhanced the pro-metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. The in vitro and in vivo results concordantly confirmed a role for endothelial Jagged1 to promote breast tumor through notch activation. Here, we propose a role for endothelial cells in enhancing breast cancer progression, stemness, and pro-metastatic traits through a perfusion-independent manner. Our findings may be beneficial in developing novel therapeutic approaches.

Deep-proteome mapping of WM-266-4 human metastatic melanoma cells: From oncogenic addiction to druggable targets	PLOS ONE												Cutaneous melanoma is a malignant tumor of skin melanocytes that are pigment-producing cells located in the basal layer (stratum basale) of epidermis. Accumulation of genetic mutations within their oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes compels melanocytes to aberrant proliferation and spread to distant organs of the body, thereby resulting in severe and/or lethal malignancy. Metastatic melanoma's heavy mutational load, molecular heterogeneity and resistance to therapy necessitate the development of novel biomarkers and drug-based protocols that target key proteins involved in perpetuation of the disease. To this direction, we have herein employed a nano liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLCMS/MS) proteomics technology to profile the deep-proteome landscape of WM-266-4 human metastatic melanoma cells. Our advanced melanoma-specific catalogue proved to contain 6,681 unique proteins, which likely constitute the hitherto largest single cell-linederived proteomic collection of the disease. Through engagement of UNIPROT, DAVID, KEGG, PANTHER, INTACT, CYTOSCAPE, dbEMT and GAD bioinformatics resources, WM-266-4 melanoma proteins were categorized according to their sub-cellular compartmentalization, function and tumorigenicity, and successfully reassembled in molecular networks and interactomes. The obtained data dictate the presence of plastically inter-converted sub-populations of non-cancer and cancer stem cells, and also indicate the oncoproteomic resemblance of melanoma to glioma and lung cancer. Intriguingly, WM-266-4 cells seem to be subjected to both epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) programs, with 1433G and ADT3 proteins being identified in the EMT/MET molecular interface. Oncogenic addiction of WM-266-4 cells to autocrine/paracrine signaling of IL17-, DLL3-, FGF(2/13)-and OSTP-dependent sub-routines suggests their critical contribution to the metastatic melanoma chemotherapeutic refractoriness. Interestingly, the 1433G family member that is shared between the BRAF-and EMT/MET-specific interactomes likely emerges as a novel and promising druggable target for the malignancy. Derailed proliferation and metastatic capacity of WM-266-4 cells could also derive from their metabolic addiction to pathways associated with glutamate/ammonia, propanoate and sulfur homeostasis, whose successful targeting may prove beneficial for advanced melanomaaffected patients.

They are frequently used to study osteogenesis in vitro. Most commonly, hBMSC are isolated from bone marrow aspirates collected in clinical routine and cultured under the "aspect plastic adherence" without any further selection. Owing to the random donor population, they show a broad heterogeneity. Here, the osteogenic differentiation potential of 531 hBMSC was analyzed. The data were supplied to correlation analysis involving donor age, gender, and body mass index. hBMSC preparations were characterized as follows: (a) how many passages the osteogenic characteristics are stable in and (b) the influence of supplements and culture duration on osteogenic parameters (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), octamer binding transcription factor 4, core-binding factor alpha-1, parathyroid hormone receptor, bone gla protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated protein gamma). The results show that no strong prediction could be made from donor data to the osteogenic differentiation potential; only the ratio of induced TNAP to endogenous TNAP could be a reliable criterion. The results give evidence that hBMSC cultures are stable until passage 7 without substantial loss of differentiation potential and that established differentiation protocols lead to osteoblast-like cells but not to fully authentic osteoblasts.																	1687-966X	1687-9678					2016	2016								7842191	10.1155/2016/7842191							WOS:000376335800001	27293446

A suitable animal model that replicates the situation in humans is not available. Therefore, the aim of the present work is to present a standardized human wound model and the data of a pilot study of topically applied progenitor cells in a sacral pressure sore. Methods: Three patients underwent cell harvest from the iliac crest at the time of the initial debridement. Forty-eight hours after bone marrow harvest and debridement, the CD34(+) selected cell suspension was injected into the wound. With the aid of a laser scanner, three-dimensional analyses of wound morphometry were performed until the defect was reconstructed with a local flap 3 weeks after debridement. Results: Decreases in volume to 60%+/- 6% of baseline on the sham side and to 52%+/- 3% of baseline on the cell side were measured. Histologic work-up revealed no signs of metaplastic, dysplastic, or neoplastic proliferation/differentiation after progenitor cell treatment. CD34(+) cells were detected in the biopsies of day 0. Conclusions: The pressure sore wound model allows investigation of the initial 3 weeks after cell-based therapy. Objective outcome analysis in terms of wound volume and histology can be performed without, or with, minimal additional morbidity, and the anatomy of the sacral area allows a control and study side in the same patient.

Deciphering the biological mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in PCa pathogenesis and progression has been hindered by numerous technical limitations mainly attributed to the limited number of cell lines available, which do not recapitulate the diverse phenotypes of clinical disease. Indeed, PCa has proven problematic to establish as cell lines in culture due to its heterogeneity which remains a challenge, despite the various in vitro and in vivo model systems available. Growth factors have been shown to play a central role in the complex regulation of cell proliferation among hormone sensitive tumors, such as PCa. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of novel patient-derived prostate epithelial (which we named as AUB-PrC) cells from organoids culture system. We also assessed the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in culturing those cells. We profiled the AUB-PrC cells isolated from unaffected and tumor patient samples via depicting their molecular and epithelial lineage features through immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as well as through functional assays and transcriptomic profiling through RNA sequencing. In addition, by optimizing a previously established prostate organoids culture system, we were able to grow human prostate epithelial cells using growth medium and EGF only. With these data collected, we were able to gain insight at the molecular architecture of novel human AUB-PrC cells, which might pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms that lead to PCa development and progression, and ultimately improving prognostic abilities and treatments.

We profiled the gene expression of CTC subpopulations immunomagnetic-captured by targeting either the melanoma-associated marker, MCSP, or the melanoma-initiating marker, ABCB5. Firstly, the expression of a subset of melanoma genes was investigated by RT-PCR in MCSP-enriched and ABCB5-enriched CTCs isolated from a total of 59 blood draws from 39 melanoma cases. Of these, 6 MCSP- and 6 ABCB5-enriched CTC fractions were further analysed using a genome-wide gene expression microarray. The transcriptional programs of both CTC subtypes included cell survival maintenance, cell proliferation, and migration pathways. ABCB5-enriched CTCs were specifically characterised by up-regulation of genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting an invasive phenotype. These findings underscore the presence of at least two distinct melanoma CTC subpopulations with distinct transcriptional programs, which may have distinct roles in disease progression and response to therapy.

Commonly Occurring Cell Subsets in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Tumors Identified by Single-Cell Mass Cytometry	CELL REPORTS												We have performed an in-depth single-cell pheno-typic characterization of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) by multiparametric mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a CyTOF antibody panel to interrogate features of HGSOC biology, combined with unsupervised computational analysis, we identified noteworthy cell types co-occurring across the tumors. In addition to a dominant cell subset, each tumor harbored rarer cell phenotypes. One such group co-expressed E-cadherin and vimentin (EV), suggesting their potential role in epithelial mesenchymal transition, which was substantiated by pairwise correlation analyses. Furthermore, tumors from patients with poorer outcome had an increased frequency of another rare cell type that co-expressed vimentin, HE4, and cMyc. These poorer-outcome tumors also populated more cell phenotypes, as quantified by Simpson's diversity index. Thus, despite the recognized genomic complexity of the disease, the specific cell phenotypes uncovered here offer a focus for therapeutic intervention and disease monitoring.

While the aberrant expression of Sox2 has been shown to significantly correlate with a number of clinicopathologic parameters in BC, its biological significance in BC is incompletely understood. Methods: In-vitro invasion assay was used to evaluate whether the expression of Sox2 is linked to the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and/or Western blots were used to assess if Sox2 modulates the expression of factors known to regulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as Twist1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to assess the binding of Sox2 to the promoter region of Twist1. Results: We found that siRNA knockdown of Sox2 expression significantly increased the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. However, when MCF7 cells were separated into two distinct subsets based on their differential responsiveness to the Sox2 reporter, the Sox2-mediated effects on invasiveness was observed only in 'reporter un-responsive' cells (RU cells) but not 'reporter responsive' cells (RR cells). Correlating with these findings, siRNA knockdown of Sox2 in RU cells, but not RR cells, dramatically increased the expression of Twist1. Accordingly, using ChIP, we found evidence that Sox2 binds to the promoter region of Twist1 in RU cells only. Lastly, siRNA knockdown of Twist1 largely abrogated the regulatory effect of Sox2 on the invasiveness in RU cells, suggesting that the observed Sox2-mediated effects are Twist1-dependent. Conclusion: Sox2 regulates the invasiveness of BC cells via a mechanism that is dependent on Twist1 and the transcriptional status of Sox2. Our results have further highlighted a new level of biological complexity and heterogeneity of BC cells that may carry significant clinical implications.																	1471-2407					JUL 1	2013	13								317	10.1186/1471-2407-13-317							WOS:000321568100002	23815808

In this study, we used MCAM/CD146, as a marker to localize, isolate and assay subendothelial clonogenic cells from the microvasculature of postnatal human skeletal muscle. We show here that these cells share with their BM counterpart, anatomic position (subendothelial/adventitial) and ex vivo clonogenicity (CFU-Fs). When assayed under the stringent conditions, these cells display a high spontaneous myogenic potential (independent of co-culture with myoblasts or of in vivo fusion with local myoblasts), which is otherwise only attained in cultures of satellite cells. These muscle-derived mural cells activated a myogenic program in culture. Cultured CD146(+) cells expressed the myogenic factors (Pax7, Pax3 and Myf5), NCAM/CD56, des min as well as proteins characteristic of more advanced myogenic differentiation, such as myosin heavy chain. In vivo, these cells spontaneously generate myotubes and myofibrils. These data identify the anatomy and phenotype of a novel class of committed myogenic progenitor in human post-natal skeletal muscle of subendothelial cells associated with the abluminal surface of microvascular compartment distinct from satellite cells.

Thus, the aim of this study was to describe those MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell line phenotype and genotype characteristics that may play a crucial role in pancreatic cancer therapeutic assays, namely neuroendocrine chemotherapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Epithelial, mesenchymal, endocrine and stem cell marker characterization was performed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, and genotyping by PCR, gene sequencing and capillary electrophoresis. MIA PaCa-2 (polymorphism) expresses CK5.6, AE1/AE3, E-cadherin, vimentin, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, SSTR2 and NTR1 but not CD56. PANC-1 (pleomorphism) expresses CK5.6, MNF-116, vimentin, chromogranin A, CD56 and SSTR2 but not E-cadherin, synaptophysin or NTR1. MIA PaCA-1 is CD24(-), CD44(+/++,) CD326(-/+) and CD133/1(-), while PANC-1 is CD24(-/+), CD44(+), CD326(-/+) and CD133/1(-). Both cell lines have KRAS and TP53 mutations and homozygous deletions including the first 3 exons of CDKN2A/p16(INK4A), but no SMAD4/DPC4 mutations or microsatellite instability. Both have neuroendocrine differentiation and SSTR2 receptors, precisely the features making them suitable for the therapies we propose to assay in future studies.

Comparison of Mitochondrial Fluorescent Dyes in Stromal Cells	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE												Specific fluorescent mitochondrial dyes JC-1, MitoTracker Red FM, and MitoTracker Red CMXRos were studied on cultures of mesenchymal stromal stem cells from human adipose tissue. Static and dynamic experiments demonstrated the dependence of dye accumulation in the mitochondria and cytoplasm on mitochondrial potential in the presence of oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler CCCP. JC-1 dye demonstrated most pronounced bleaching upon repeated laser exposure even in very low doses, which should be taken into account when planning dynamic experiments on live cells. Moreover, this dye requires two-wave recording in red and green spectral bands. MitoTracker Red FM and MitoTracker Red CMXRos are resistant to bleaching, but for the latter, the intensity of fluorescence reflects not only the mitochondrial potential. MitoTracker Red CMXRos covalently binds to sulfhydryl groups in mitochondrial lipids and proteins, which can lead to misinterpretation of the fluorescence intensity-mitochondrial potential dependence.

Abrogation of p53 function leads to metastatic transcriptome networks that typify tumor progression in human breast cancer xenografts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY												Development of chromosomal instability (CIN) and consequent phenotypic heterogeneity represent common events during breast cancer progression. Breast carcinomas harboring extensive chromosomal aberrations display a more aggressive behavior characterized by chemoresistance and the propensity to give rise to distant metastases. The tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and tissue homeostasis through activation of cell cycle checkpoints following DNA damage and control of centrosome duplication that ensures equal chromosome segregation during cell division. Furthermore, p53 suppresses CD44 expression and the acquisition of stem cell-like properties responsible for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In this study we employed MCF-7 breast cancer cells with endogenous wild-type p53, an engineered MCF-7 variant (vMCF-7(DNP53)) overexpressing a dominant negative p53val135 mutant, and cells re-cultured from vMCF-7(DNP53) tumor xenografts. We carried out an integrative transcriptome and cytogenetic analysis to characterize the mechanistic linkage between loss of p53 function. EMT and consequent establishment of invasive gene signatures during breast cancer progression. We demonstrate that abrogation of p53 function drives the early transcriptome changes responsible for cell proliferation. EMT and survival, while further transcriptome changes that occur during in vivo tumor progression are mechanistically linked to the development of CIN leading to a more invasive and metastatic breast cancer phenotype. Here we identified distinct novel non-canonical transcriptome networks involved in cell proliferation, EMT, chemoresistance and invasion that arise following abrogation of p53 function in vitro and development of CIN in vivo. These studies also have important translational implications since some of the nodal genes identified here are 'druggable' making them appropriate molecular targets for the treatment of breast carcinomas displaying mutant p53, EMT. CIN and high metastatic potential.

The expression of biliary-hepatic progenitor cell markers generally correlates with poor prognosis. This article focuses on the pathogenesis of HOC, how differentiation or dedifferentiation leads to a phenotype switch, and heterogeneity in the same tumor. A tumor cell decides its fate based on a complex interplay of signaling pathways. Interaction with the microenvironment decides whether it will invade, proliferate, or enter survival mode. Several signaling pathways contribute to stemness features, reflecting a small chemoresistant subpopulation of the tumor that expresses biliary-hepatic progenitor cell markers.

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived MSCs would circumvent many of current issues and enable large-scale production of standardized cellular therapy. To explore differences between native MSCs (nMSCs) and iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs), we developed isogeneic lines from Wharton's jelly (WJ) from the umbilical cords of two donors (#12 and #13) under xeno-free conditions. Next, we reprogrammed them into iPSCs (iPSC12 and iPSC13) and subsequently differentiated them back into iMSCs (iMSC12 and iMSC13) using two different protocols, which we named ARG and TEX. We assessed their differentiation capability, transcriptome, immunomodulatory potential, and interferon-gamma (IFNG)-induced changes in metabolome. Our data demonstrated that although both differentiation protocols yield iMSCs similar to their parental nMSCs, there are substantial differences. The ARG protocol resulted in iMSCs with a strong immunomodulatory potential and lower plasticity and proliferation rate, whereas the TEX protocol raised iMSCs with a higher proliferation rate, better differentiation potential, though weak immunomodulatory response. Our data suggest that, following a careful selection and screening of donors, nMSCs from umbilical's cord WJ can be easily reprogrammed into iPSCs, providing an unlimited source of material for differentiation into iMSCs. However, the differentiation protocol should be chosen depending on their clinical use.

Tumor cell heterogeneity and influence from the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to the complexity of the disease and large variability in clinical outcomes. Methods To model the heterogeneous nature of colorectal cancer, we used patient-derived scaffolds (PDS), which were obtained via decellularization of surgically resected tumor material, as a growth substrate for standardized cell lines. Results After confirmation of native cell absence and validation of the structural and compositional integrity of the matrix, 89 colorectal PDS were repopulated with colon cancer cell line HT29. After 3 weeks of PDS culture, HT29 cells varied their gene and protein expression profiles considerably compared to 2D-grown HT29 cells. Markers associated with proliferation were consistently decreased, while markers associated with pluripotency were increased in PDS-grown cells compared to their 2D counterparts. When comparing the PDS-induced changes in HT29 cells with clinically relevant tumor information from individual patients, we observed significant associations between stemness/pluripotency markers and tumor location, and between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cancer mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that low PDS-induced EMT correlated with worse cancer-specific survival. Conclusions The colorectal PDS model can be used as a simplified personalized tool that can potentially reveal important diagnostic and pathophysiological information related to the TME.

J	Arneth, B				Arneth, Borros			Comparison of Burnet's clonal selection theory with tumor cell-clone development	THERANOSTICS												Increasing evidence has shown that Darwin's theory of evolution provides vital insights into the emergence and etiology of different types of cancer. On a microscopic scale, cancer stem cells meet the conditions for the Darwinian process of natural selection. In particular, cancer stem cells undergo cell reproduction characterized by the emergence of heritable variability that promotes replication and cell survival. Methods: Evidence from previous studies was gathered to compare Burnet's clonal selection theory with the tumor evolution theory. Results: The findings show that the Darwinian theory offers a general framework for understanding fundamental aspects of cancer. As fundamental theoretical frameworks, Burnet's clonal selection theory and the tumor evolution theory can be used to explain cancer cell evolution and identify the beneficial adaptations that contribute to cell survival in tissue landscapes and tissue ecosystems. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study shows that both Burnet's clonal selection theory and the tumor evolution theory postulate that cancer cells in tissue ecosystems evolve through reiterative processes, such as clonal expansion, clonal selection, and genetic diversification. Therefore, both theories provide insights into the complexities and dynamics of cancer, including its development and progression. Finally, we take into account the occurrence of biologic variation in both tumor cells and lymphocytes. It is important to note that the presence of lymphocyte variations appears to be advantageous in the framework of tumor defense but also dangerous within the framework of autoimmune disease development.																	1838-7640						2018	8	12					3392	3399		10.7150/thno.24083							WOS:000435483500005	29930737

Here we show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support tumor growth in vivo and maintain the stemness of cancer stem/initiating cells in an in vitro model using an established CAF cell line. We found that CD44 is abundantly expressed on CAFs. This molecule is a cancer stem cell marker in several tumors, but its role in tumorigenesis when expressed by CAFs has not been investigated. It is generally accepted that hypoxic and hyponutritional conditions are triggers of cancer malignancy. We found that CAFs strongly express CD44 in hypoxic and avascular areas in the tumor and that its expression on established CAFs is upregulated under hypoxic and hyponutritional conditions in vitro. In addition, CAF CD44-positivity in tumor tissues was increased after treatment with inhibitors of angiogenesis. Using cocultures and tumor sphere formation assays, CAFs from wild-type mice were found to sustain the stemness of cancer stem/initiating cells, while CD44-deficient CAFs did not. Furthermore, CD44 was involved in malignant cancer cell drug resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, our study suggests that CD44 on CAFs is a functional molecule contributing to the maintenance of cancer stem cell populations in the tumor microenvironment.

Herein, we first demonstrated that the frequencies of the aberrancies of DNA methylation-correlated (METcor) and microRNA (miRNA)-correlated (MIRcor) genes were significantly co-regulated. Next, through integrative clustering of the expression profiles of METcor and MIRcor genes, four molecular subtypes were identified in CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and then validated in four independent datasets. More importantly, the four subtypes were well characterized and showed distinct clinical and molecular features: (i) S-I: high metabolic activity, sensitive to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and good prognosis; (ii) S-II: moderate metabolic activity, marked proliferation, frequent KRAS mutation and intermediate prognosis; (iii) S-III: moderate metabolic activity, marked proliferation, promoter DNA hypermethylation, high mutation burden, frequent BRAF and EGFR mutations, moderate levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) signals, immune-inflamed phenotype, sensitive to cetuximab and death protein-1 inhibitor treatment and relatively poor prognosis and (iv) S-IV: miRNA overexpression, stem/serrated/mesenchymal-like properties, hypoxia, high levels of EMT and TGF beta signals, immune-excluded phenotype and poor prognosis.

Noninvasive imaging methods are needed to study tissue-engineered constructs before and after implantation. Here, we show that high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on a clinical 1.5-T device is a reliable technique to assess three-dimensional structures of porous scaffolds and to validate cell-seeding procedures. A high-temperature superconducting detection coil was used to achieve a resolution of 30 x 30 x 30 mm(3) when imaging the scaffolds. Three types of structures with tuneable architectures were prepared from naturally derived polysaccharides and evaluated as scaffolds for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture. To monitor cell seeding, MSCs were magnetically labeled using simple incubation with anionic citrate-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles for 30 min. Iron uptake was quantified using single-cell magnetophoresis, and cell proliferation was checked for 7 days after labeling. Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures of scaffolds were assessed using MRI, revealing lamellar or globular porous organization according to the scaffold preparation process. MSCs with different iron load (5, 12 and 31 pg of iron per cell) were seeded on scaffolds at low density (132 cells/mm(3)) and detected on 3D gradient-echo MR images according to phase distortions and areas of intensely low signal, whose size increased with cell iron load and echo time. Overall signal loss in the scaffold correlated with the number of seeded cells and their iron load. Different organizations of cells were observed depending on the scaffold architecture. After subcutaneous implantation in mice, scaffolds seeded with labeled cells could be distinguished in vivo from scaffold with nonlabeled cells by observation of signal and phase heterogeneities and by measuring the global signal loss. High-resolution 1.5-T MRI combined with efficient intracellular contrast agents shows promise for noninvasive 3D visualization of tissue-engineered constructs before and after in vivo implantation.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a physical link between loading and bone cells, where mechanoreceptors, such as integrins, initiate mechanosensation. Though this relationship is well studied, the dynamic interplay between mechanosensation, mechanotransduction and cellular responses is unclear. A hybrid-multiscale model combining molecular, cellular and tissue interactions was developed to examine links between integrins' mechanosensation and effects on mechanotransduction, ECM modulation and cell-ECM interaction. The model shows that altering integrin mechanosensitivity threshold (MT) increases mechanotransduction durations from hours to beyond 4 days, where bone formation starts. This is relevant to bone, where it is known that a brief stimulating period provides persistent influences for over 24 hours. Furthermore, the model forecasts that integrin heterogeneity, with respect to MT, would be able to induce sustained increase in pERK baseline > 15% beyond 4 days. This is analogous to the emergence of molecular mechanical memory signalling dynamics. Therefore, the model can provide a greater understanding of mechanical adaptation to differential mechanical responses at different times. Given reduction of bone sensitivity to mechanical stimulation with age, these findings may lead towards useful therapeutic targets for upregulation of bone mass.

Increased adipogenic conversion of muscle satellite cells in obese Zucker rats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY												Aims/hypothesis: Visceral and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) depots account for most obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Muscle satellite cells (SCs) are mesenchymal stem cells giving rise to myotubes and also to adipocytes, suggesting their possible contribution to IMAT origin and expansion. We investigated the myogenic differentiation of SCs and the adipogenic potential of both preadipocytes and SCs from genetically obese Zucker rats (fa/fa), focusing on the role of Wnt signaling in these differentiation processes. Methods: SCs were isolated by single-fiber technique from flexor digitorum brevis muscle and preadipocytes were extracted from subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT). Morphological features and gene expression profile were evaluated during in vitro myogenesis and adipogenesis. Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 10b (Wnt10b) expression was quantified by quantitative PCR in skeletal muscle and AT. Results: We did not observe any difference in the proliferation rate and in the myogenic differentiation of SCs from obese and lean rats. However, a decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake was present in myotubes originating from fa/fa rats. Under adipogenic conditions, preadipocytes and SCs of obese animals displayed an enhanced adipogenesis. Wnt10b expression was reduced in obese rats in both muscle and AT. Conclusions/interpretation: Our data suggest that the increase in different fat depots including IMAT and the reduced muscle insulin sensitivity, the major phenotypical alteration of obese Zucker rats, could be ascribed to an intrinsic defect, either genetically determined or acquired, still present in both muscle and fat precursors. The involvement of Wnt10b as a regulator of both adipogenesis and muscle-to-fat conversion is suggested.

Progenitor cell therapies show promise in both preclinical and clinical studies.We conducted a meta-analysis of preclinical studies using progenitor cells to treat TBI. Methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Review, Biosis, and Google Scholar were searched for articles using prespecified search strategies. Studies meeting inclusion criteria underwent data extraction. Analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 according to a fixed-effects model, and all studies underwent quality scoring. Results: Of 430 abstracts identified, 38 met inclusion criteria and underwent analysis. Average quality score was 4.32 of 8 possible points. No study achieved a perfect score. Lesion volume (LV) and neurologic severity score (NSS) outcomes favored cell treatment with standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.64-1.09) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.11-1.60),respectively.Rotarod and Morris water maze outcomes also favored treatment with improvements in SMD of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.02-0.65) and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.17-74), respectively. Although LV and NSS were robust to publication bias assessments, rotarod and Morris water maze tests were not.Heterogeneity (I-2) ranged from 74%-85% among the analyses, indicating a high amount of heterogeneity among studies. Precision as a function of quality score showed a statistically significant increase in the size of the confidence interval as quality improved. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis study reveals an overall positive effect of progenitor cell therapies on LV and NSS with a trend toward improved motor function and spatial learning in different TBI animal models.

Activated in response to DNA damage, cell cycle and mitotic checkpoints activate the p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways and induce apoptosis or senescence. Since senescent cells survive and produce a secretome that influences neighbouring cells, it is not particularly clear whether these responses are equivalent and if tumor cells escape these two suppressive pathways to the same extent. Predicting escape is also complicated by the fact that cancer cells adapt to treatments by activating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and by producing clones with cancer-initiating cells features. Dedifferentiation pathways used in stressful conditions reconstitute dividing and sometimes more aggressive populations in response to chemotherapy. These observations illustrate the importance of tumor heterogeneity and the adaptation capacities of different intra-tumoral subclones. Depending on their oncogenic profile, on their localisation within the tumor and on their interaction with stromal cells, these subclones are expected to have different responses and adaptation capacities to chemotherapy. A complete eradication will certainly rely on combination therapies that can kill at the same time the bulk of the sensitive tumor but can also prevent plasticity and the generation of persistent clones.

Pre-selection of cell subpopulations harboring higher osteopotential is a promising strategy to achieve a thorough translation of MSC-based therapies to the clinic. Here, we searched for novel molecular markers predictive of osteopotential by comparing MSC populations from two sources harboring different osteogenic potentials. We show that MSCs from human deciduous teeth (SHED) have an intrinsically higher osteogenic potential when compared with MSCs from human adipose tissue (hASCs) under the same in vitro controlled induction system. Transcriptome profiling revealed IGF2 to be one of the top upregulated transcripts before and during early in vitro osteogenic differentiation. Further, exogenous IGF2 supplementation enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization, and inhibition of IGF2 lessened these parameters in SHED and hASCs, validating IGF2 as an osteogenic factor in these MSCs. Further, we found IGF2 to be biallelically expressed in SHED, but not in hASCs. We observed a 4 % methylation increase in the imprinting control region within the IGF2-H19 locus in SHED, and this is mainly due to 2 specific CpG sites. Thus, we suggest that IGF2 upregulation in SHED is due to loss of imprinting. This study unravels osteogenic properties in SHED, implying IGF2 as a potential biomarker of MSCs with higher osteopotential, and unveils IGF2 loss-of-imprinting in SHED.

They are believed to be a very appealing and safe material for clinical applications. Primary hAC have been proposed as an efficient source of immunomodulatory factors that could be used as alternative or supporting to classical drug immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate hAC immunomodulatory properties post-activation by inflammatory cytokines as Interleukin 1 beta and Interferon gamma. hAC were isolated and characterized by the expression of pluripotency marker SSEA4, epithelial marker CK7, HLA-G antigen, mRNA for PTGS2, NOS2 and HLA-G gene, and secretion of soluble mediators as HLA-G and PGE2 in the culture medium in presence or absence of INF-gamma and IL-1 beta. Heterogeneity of the cultured hAC was proved, with 50 +/- 8% of cells positive for epithelial marker (CK7), and 73 +/- 3% expressing SSEA4 pluripotency marker. Priming effect by in vitro exposure to INF-gamma and IL-1 beta resulted in a significant increase in expression of PTGS2, NOS2 and HLA-G gene, with a peak between 32 and 64 h. The highest PGE2 concentration was measured in the culture medium at 48 h. At 96 h, a significant difference in the percentage of SSEA4(+) hAC between activated and non-activated cells, as well as the highest expression of HLA-G - especially in SSEA4(+) cells, and highly elevated concentration of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) in the medium of activated cells, were found. The prolonged exposure of primary human amnion-derived cells to inflammatory cytokines INF-gamma and IL-1 beta may result in enhanced expression and secretion of immunomodulatory molecules important in allogenic therapies.				gramignoli, roberto/AAD-8669-2019; Kopaczka, Katarzyna/ABD-9846-2020	gramignoli, roberto/0000-0003-3362-4170; Wieczorek, Patrycja/0000-0001-7598-1817; Kolanko, Emanuel/0000-0001-7485-0823												0014-2999	1879-0712				SEP 15	2019	859								172545	10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.172545							WOS:000477819500030	31319066

Previous attempts to generate such resources to study breast cancer have yielded predominantly basal-type cell lines. We have created a panel of immortalized cell lines from core breast biopsies of ancestry-mapped healthy women that form ductal structures similar to normal breast in 3D cultures and expressed markers of major cell types, including the luminal-differentiated cell-enriched ER zeta-FOXA1-GATA3 transcription factor network. We have also created cell lines from PROCR (CD201)(+)/EpCAM(-) cells that are likely the "normal" counterpart of the claudin-low subtype of breast cancers. RNA-seq and PAM50-intrinsic subtype clustering identified these cell lines as the "normal" counterparts of luminal A, basal, and normal-like subtypes and validated via immunostaining with basal-enriched KRT14 and luminal-enriched KRT19. We further characterized these cell lines by flow cytometry for distribution patterns of stem/basal, luminal- progenitor, mature/differentiated, multipotent PROCR+ cells, and organogenesis-enriched epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid cells using CD44/CD24, CD49f/EpCAM, CD271/EpCAM, CD201/EpCAM, and ALDEFLUOR assays and E-cadherin/vimentin double staining. These cell lines showed interindividual heterogeneity in stemness/differentiation capabilities and baseline activity of signaling molecules such as NF-kappa B, AKT2, pERK, and BRD4. These resources can be used to test the emerging concept that genetic variations in regulatory regions contribute to widespread differences in gene expression in "normal" conditions among the general population and can delineate the impact of cell-type origin on tumor progression. Significance: In addition to providing a valuable resource for the breast cancer research community to investigate cell-type origin of different subtypes of breast cancer, this study highlights interindividual differences in normal breast, emphasizing the need to use "normal" cells from multiple sources as controls to decipher the effects of cancer-specific genomic aberrations.

Pericyte dropout can cause increased vascular permeability and contribute to vascular occlusion. Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) have been suggested to replace pericytes and restore microvascular support as potential therapy of DR. In models of DR, ASC not only generated a cytoprotective and reparative environment by the secretion of trophic factors but also engrafted and integrated into the retina in a pericyte-like fashion. The aim of this study was to compare the pro-angiogenic features of human ASC and human retinal microvascular pericytes (HRMVPC)in vitro. The proliferation and the expression of ASC and HRMVPC markers were compared. Adhesion to high glucose-conditioned endothelial extracellular matrix, mimicking the diabetic microenvironment, was measured. The angiogenesis-promoting features of both cell types and their conditioned media on human retinal endothelial cells (EC) were assessed. To identify a molecular basis for the observed differences, gene expression profiling was performed using whole-genome microarrays, and data were validated using PCR arrays and flow cytometry. Based on multiplex cytokine results, functional studies on selected growth factors were performed to assess their role in angiogenic support. Despite a distinct heterogeneity in ASC and HRMVPC cultures with an overlap of expressed markers, ASC differed functionally from HRMVPC. Most importantly, the pro-angiogenic activity was solely featured by ASC, whereas HRMVPC actively suppressed vascular network formation. HRMVPC, in contrast to ASC, showed impaired adhesion and proliferation on the high glucose-conditioned endothelial extracellular matrix. These data were supported by gene expression profiles with differentially expressed genes. The vessel-stabilizing factors were more highly expressed in HRMVPC, and the angiogenesis-promoting factors were more highly expressed in ASC. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 inhibition efficiently abolished the ASC angiogenic supportive capacities, whereas the addition of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 did not alter these effects. Our results clearly show that ASC are pro-angiogenic, whereas HRMVPC are marked by anti-angiogenic/EC-stabilizing features. These data support ASC as pericyte replacement in DR but also suggest a careful risk-to-benefit analysis to take full advantage of the ASC therapeutic features.

Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was recently revealed as a major parameter of poor clinical outcome. Here, we addressed the expression and function of the therapeutic target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of the major determinant of epithelial differentiation epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in clinical samples and in vitro models of HNSCCs. We describe improved survival of EGFR(low)/EpCAM(high) HNSCC patients (n = 180) and provide a molecular basis for the observed disparities in clinical outcome. EGF/EGFR have concentration-dependent dual capacities as inducers of proliferation and EMT through differential activation of the central molecular switch phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) and EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs) Snail, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), and Slug. Furthermore, soluble ectodomain extracellular domain of EpCAM (EpEX) was identified as a ligand of EGFR that activates pERK1/2 and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and induces EGFR-dependent proliferation but represses EGF-mediated EMT, Snail, Zeb1, and Slug activation and cell migration. EMT repression by EpEX is realized through competitive modulation of pERK1/2 activation strength and inhibition of EMT-TFs, which is reflected in levels of pERK1/2 and its target Slug in clinical samples. Accordingly, high expression of pERK1/2 and/or Slug predicted poor outcome of HNSCCs. Hence, EpEX is a ligand of EGFR that induces proliferation but counteracts EMT mediated by the EGF/EGFR/pERK1/2 axis. Therefore, the emerging EGFR/EpCAM molecular cross talk represents a promising target to improve patient-tailored adjuvant treatment of HNSCCs.

It is known that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in therapy resistance and CSC-based targeted therapies have been considered as a powerful tool for cancer treatment. In the current study, we investigated the synergistic effects of suppressing signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) function by decoy ODNs on X-irradiation (XI) and methotrexate (MTX) exposure as a combinational therapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells. Lipofectamine 2000 (R) was used as a transfecting agent and the cells treated with Scramble ODNs (SCR) and decoy ODNs were subjected to irradiation with 2 Gy at single/fractionated (XI group) doses, different concentration of MTX group, and X-irradiation-methotrexate (XI/MTX group). Synergistic effects of STAT3 SCR and decoy ODNs on cells were investigated by cell viability (MTT), cell cycle profile, apoptosis rate, migration, and invasion assays. Statistical analysis of obtained data showed that STAT3 decoy ODNs significantly decreased the cell viability, arrested the growth at G0/G1 phase, increased apoptosis rate, and reduced migrated and invaded cells through transwell membrane, in XI, MTX, and XI/MTX exposed groups. Since STAT3 is a master transcription factor in breast cancer cells stemness, aggressiveness, TNBC's heterogeneity, and therapy resistance; therefore, inhibition of this transcription factor by decoy ODNs could increase antitumor efficiencies of XI and MTX exposure strategies. Accordingly, this method could have the potential to increase the efficiency of combination therapies.

J	Fodde, R; Brabletz, T				Fodde, Riccardo; Brabletz, Thomas			Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer stemness and malignant behavior	CURRENT OPINION IN CELL BIOLOGY												Stem cells are defined by their intrinsic capacity to self-renew and differentiate. Cancer stem cells retain both these features but have lost homeostatic mechanisms which maintain normal cell numbers. The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a central role in modulating the delicate balance between sternness and differentiation in several adult stem cell niches such as the hair follicles in the skin, the mammary gland, and the intestinal crypt. Accordingly, constitutive Wnt signaling activation, resulting from mutations in genes encoding its downstream components, underlies tumorigenesis in these tissues. In the majority of sporadic colorectal cancer cases, the rate-limiting event is either loss of APC function or oncogenic beta-catenin mutations. However, although the presence of these initiating mutations would predict nuclear beta-catenin accumulation throughout the tumor mass, heterogeneous intracellular distributions of this key Wnt signaling molecule are observed within primary tumors and their metastases. In particular, tumor cells located at the invasive front and those migrating into the adjacent stromal tissues show nuclear beta-catenin staining. Hence, different levels of Wnt signaling activity reflect tumor heterogeneity and are likely to account for distinct cellular activities such as proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, which prompt tumor growth and malignant behavior, respectively. Several intrinsic (cell-autonomous and/or autocrine) and extrinsic (paracrine, derived from the tumor microenvironment) factors may explain this heterogeneity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity within the tumor mass.

In this study, we examined the hypothesis that CDCs favor heart repair by switching the macrophages from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) into a regulatory anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2). Macrophages from mice were cultured with CDCs-conditioned medium or with fibroblasts-conditioned medium as a control. Immunostaining showed that CDCs-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the expression of CD206 (a marker for M2 macrophages), but decreased the expression of CD86 (a marker for M1 macrophages) 3 days after culture. For animal studies, we used an acute myocardial infarction model of mice. We injected CDCs, fibroblasts, or saline only into the border zone of infarction. Then we collected the heart tissues for histological analysis 5 and 14 days after treatment. Compared with control animals, CDCs treatment significantly decreased M1 macrophages and neutrophils but increased M2 macrophages in the infarcted heart. Furthermore, CDCs-treated mice had reduced infarct size and fewer apoptotic cells compared to the controls. Our data suggest that CDCs facilitate heart repair by modulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization and neutrophil recruitment, which may provide a new insight into the mechanisms of stem cell-based myocardial repair.

Transferring mitochondria to cells is an emerging and promising technique for the therapy of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA)-related diseases. This paper presents a unique method of controlling the quality and quantity of mitochondria transferred to single cells using an automated optical tweezer-based micromanipulation system. The proposed method can automatically, accurately, and efficiently collect and transport healthy mitochondria to cells, and the recipient cells then take up the mitochondria through endocytosis. The results of the study reveal the possibility of using mitochondria from fetal mesenchymal stem cells (fMSCs) as a potential source to reverse the aging-related phenotype and improve metabolic activities in adult mesenchymal stem cells (aMSCs). The results of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis show that the transfer of isolated mitochondria from fMSCs to a single aMSC can significantly increase the antiaging and metabolic gene expression in the aMSC. The proposed mitochondrial transfer method can greatly promote precision medicine for cell therapy of mtDNA-related diseases.

Tooth cells that proliferate in vitro have polyclonal immunoreactivity (IR) for glial fibrillary acidic protein, (GFAP), growth-associated protein (GAP-43), And vimentin, plus glial-like ion channels. Here, we analyzed GFAP-IR patterns in dental and trigeminal tissues of rats, for comparison With green fluorescent protein (GFP) associated with GFAP transcription in transgenic mice, in order to better characterize glial-like cells in dental tissues. Astrocytes, ganglion satellite cells, And epineurial Schwann cells were demonstrated by anti-GFAP antibodies and GFP-GFAP, as expected. Odontoblasts did not, stain by any of these methods and cannot be the glial-like cells. Fibroblasts and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in pulp had polyclonal GFAP-IR and vimentin-IR, while nerve fibers reacted only with polyclonal antibody. Some Schwann cell subtypes in trigeminal nerve and Oral mucosa were positive for GFP and for polyclonal anti-GFAP, but not for monoclonal antibody. In pulp. almost all Schwann cells were unstained, but many Schwann cells in periodontal ligament had polyclonal GFAP-IR. These results show greater heterogeneity for Schwann cells than expected, and suggest that the glial-like pulp cells are fibroblasts and/or undifferentiated mesenchymal cells or stem cells. We also found that polyclonal GFAP revealed intermediate filaments in preterminal sensory nerve fibers, thereby providing a useful marker for that neural subregion. GFP transcription by some Schwann cell subtypes in oral mucosae and trigeminal nerve, but not trigeminal root Was a novel finding that reveals more complexity in peripheral glia than previously recognized.

However, there is considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients, and the molecular basis for the evolution of immunodeficiency into MDS/AML remains unknown. Thus, we conducted whole-genome sequencing on a patient with a germline GATA-2 heterozygous mutation (c. 988 C > T; p. R330X), who had a history suggestive of immunodeficiency and evolved into MDS/AML. Analysis was conducted with DNA samples from leukocytes for immunodeficiency, bone marrow mononuclear cells for MDS and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Whereas we did not identify a candidate genomic deletion that may contribute to the evolution into MDS, a total of 280 MDS-specific nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants were identified. By narrowing down with the single nucleotide polymorphism database, the functional missense database, and NCBI information, we finally identified three candidate mutations for EZH2, HECW2 and GATA-1, which may contribute to the evolution of the disease.

As a high molecular weight polysaccharide, hyaluronan (HA) not only has been shown to regulate cancer processes including cell invasion, metastasis, migration, and proliferation, but also is a major component of the BM extracellular matrix. Here, we tested whether HA promotes breast cancer cell quiescence through detecting cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, and the expression of cell cycle-related regulator proteins. In our results, HA slowed the growth and prolonged the G0/G1 phase of the highly metastatic, bone-seeking human breast cancer MDA-MB-231BO cell line, which is consistent with results that HA activated p38 alpha/beta, inhibited phospho-ERK1/2 levels and reduced the ERK/p38 signaling ratio. Additionally, we examined the crucial cell cycle factors p21(cip1) and Cyclin D1, both of which influence the transition from G1 to S phase. The results revealed that p21(cip1) expression was up-regulated by HA, which was consequently accompanied by a decrease in Cyclin D1 level. Further research with a 3D culture model indicated that HA maintained low Ki-67 and high p21(cip1) expression levels in MDA-MB-231BO cells. In summary, our work revealed that HA might contribute to DTC quiescence.																	1672-9145	1745-7270				DEC	2018	50	12					1181	1189		10.1093/abbs/gmy126							WOS:000456134400001	30371731

M.			Growth and metastatic behavior of molecularly well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines in mice	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT												Breast cancer (BC) is a disease with intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, and models representing the complete variety of clinical BC phenotypes are not available. We explored the tumor growth potential and metastatic behavior of human BC cell lines and determined whether these cell lines can recapitulate subtype-related biological characteristics of tumors. Eighteen human BC cell lines were implanted under the mammary fat pad of nude mice. Subtype-specific differences in tumor growth, metastatic ability to distant sites, and tumor-related survival of mice were recorded. Eighty-nine percent of the cell lines gave rise to xenografts of which 56 % showed metastasis to distant sites. A clear difference was observed in growth of xenografts from cell lines of different molecular subtypes (P = 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test). Mice bearing the basal-like and the normal-like xenografts showed poor tumor-related survival (HR: 10.50; P = 0.002 and HR: 9.89; P = 0.003, respectively) compared with those bearing the ERBB2-positive xenografts, which had the longest survival. Subtype-specific metastasis to distant sites between xenografts was not however observed. Comparable to clinical behavior in humans, we observed that the basal-like and the normal-like cell lines grew more aggressively in mice than the cell lines of other molecular subtypes. However, in contrast to clinical findings, we observed no relationships between intrinsic subtype and preferences for site of relapse. Importantly, we have established xenograft models from 16 phenotypically and molecularly diverse human BC cell lines, which can be exploited as useful tools to perform functional studies and screening of interfering drugs.

Therefore, it is clinically useful to identify the relevant CSC marker that is associated with prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clarify its genetic and biological characteristics. MethodsExpression of four CSC markers, CD13, EpCAM, CD44 and CD44v9, was examined in 99 HCC patients. Biological and cDNA/miRNA microarray data were compared among CD44-positive/-negative HCC cells and normal hepatic cells. The significance of the representative miRNAs was examined with regard to prognosis of additional 110 HCC patients. ResultsCD44-positive HuH7 cells proliferated faster and showed a greater sphere forming ability than CD44-negative HuH7 cells. CD44-positive HuH7 cells exhibited higher expression of specific genes involved in resistance to reactive oxygen species, anticancer drugs and tumour invasion than CD44-negative HCC cells. Higher expression of six miRNAs was observed in CD44-positive HuH7 cells, CD44-negative HuH7 cells, and human normal hepatic cells in that order. Of the six miRNAs, miR-137 was closely associated with overall and cancer-specific survivals, as well as with invasion of hepatic vein, hepatic artery, portal vein and bile duct, and alpha-foetoprotein in additional 110 HCC patients. ConclusionsmiR-137 may serve as a prognostic marker in patients with HCC and may be a potential target for the elimination of liver CSCs.

Here, we identify a SIRT1-PRRX1-KLF4-ALDH1 circuitry, which couples CSCs, chemo-resistance, metastasis and aging. Pro-longevity protein SIRT1 deacetylates and stabilizes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) inducer PRRX1, which inhibits the transcription of core stemness factor KLF4. Loss of SIRT1 destabilizes PRRX1, disinhibits KLF4, and activates the transcription of ALDH1, which induces and functionally marks CSCs, resulting in chemo-resistance and metastatic relapse. Clinically, the level of PRRX1 is positively linked to SIRT1, whereas KLF4 is reversely correlated. Importantly, KLF4 inhibitor Kenpaullone sensitizes breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors to Paclitaxel and improves therapeutic effects. Our findings delineate a SIRT1-centered circuitry that regulates CSC origination, and targeting this pathway might be a promising therapeutic strategy.

Progress Toward Improving Animal Models for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCES												Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a disease with an unknown cause and a poor prognosis. Among attempts to define disease pathogenesis, animal models of experimental lung fibrosis have a prominent role. Commonly used models include exposure to bleomycin, silica, fluorescein isothiocyanate; irradiation; or expression of specific genes through a viral vector or transgenic system. These all have been instrumental in the study of lung fibrosis, but all have limitations and fall short of recapitulating a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia, the pathologic correlate to IPF. A model of repetitive bleomycin lung injury has recently been reported that results in marked lung fibrosis, prominent alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia, a pattern of temporal heterogeneity and persistence of aberrant remodeling well after stimulus removal, representing a significant addition to the collection of animal lung fibrosis models. Taken together, animal models remain a key component in research strategies to better define IPF pathogenesis.																	0002-9629	1538-2990				JUN	2011	341	6					444	449		10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31821aa000							WOS:000291004900006	21613932

Cooperation between melanoma cell states promotes metastasis through heterotypic cluster formation	DEVELOPMENTAL CELL												Melanomas can have multiple coexisting cell states, including proliferative (PRO) versus invasive (INV) sub populations that represent a "go or grow"trade-off; however, how these populations interact is poorly understood. Using a combination of zebrafish modeling and analysis of patient samples, we show that INV and PRO cells form spatially structured heterotypic clusters and cooperate in the seeding of metastasis, maintaining cell state heterogeneity. INV cells adhere tightly to each other and form clusters with a rim of PRO cells. Intravital imaging demonstrated cooperation in which INV cells facilitate dissemination of less metastatic PRO cells. We identified the TFAP2 neural crest transcription factor as a master regulator of clustering and PRO/INV states. Isolation of clusters from patients with metastatic melanoma revealed a subset with heterotypic PRO-INV clusters. Our data suggest a framework for the co-existence of these two divergent cell populations, in which heterotypic clusters promote metastasis via cell-cell cooperation.

One of the most important prognostic factors for survival is the early detection of the disease. Recent studies indicate that extracellular vesicles may provide diagnostic information for cancer management. We demonstrate the secretion of extracellular vesicles by primary breast epithelial cells enriched for stem/progenitor cells cultured as mammospheres, in non-adherent conditions. Using a proteomic approach we identified proteins contained in these vesicles whose expression is affected by hormonal changes in the cellular environment. In addition, we showed that these vesicles are capable of promoting changes in expression levels of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell markers.

Here, we report the distinction of two CAF subtypes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) that have differential tumor-promoting capability, one with a transcriptome and secretome closer to normal fibroblasts (CAF-N) and the other with a more divergent expression pattern (CAF-D). Both subtypes supported higher tumor incidence in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) Il gamma 2(null) mice and deeper invasion of malignant keratinocytes than normal or dysplasia-associated fibroblasts, but CAF-N was more efficient than CAF-D in enhancing tumor incidence. CAF-N included more intrinsically motile fibroblasts maintained by high autocrine production of hyaluronan. Inhibiting CAF-N migration by blocking hyaluronan synthesis or chain elongation impaired invasion of adjacent OSCC cells, pinpointing fibroblast motility as an essential mechanism in this process. In contrast, CAF-D harbored fewer motile fibroblasts but synthesized higher TGF-beta 1 levels. TGF-beta 1 did not stimulate CAF-D migration but enhanced invasion and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in malignant keratinocytes. Inhibiting TGF-beta 1 in three-dimensional cultures containing CAF-D impaired keratinocyte invasion, suggesting TGF-beta 1-induced EMT mediates CAF-D-induced carcinoma cell invasion. TGF-beta 1-pretreated normal fibroblasts also induced invasive properties in transformed oral keratinocytes, indicating that TGF-beta 1-synthesizing fibroblasts, as well as hyaluronan-synthesizing fibroblasts, are critical for carcinoma invasion. Taken together, these results discern two subtypes of CAF that promote OSCC cell invasion via different mechanisms. (C) 2013 AACR.

Clonal MET Amplification as a Determinant of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Resistance in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Mutant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY												PURPOSE Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) activation has been implicated as an oncogenic driver in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can mediate primary and secondary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). High copy number thresholds have been suggested to enrich for response to MET inhibitors. We examined the clinical relevance of MET copy number gain (CNG) in the setting of treatment-naive metastatic EGFR-mutant-positive NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS MET fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in 200 consecutive patients identified as metastatic treatment-naive EGFR-mutant-positive. We defined MET-high as CNG greater than or equal to 5, with an additional criterion of MET/centromeric portion of chromosome 7 rati greater than or equal to 2 for amplification. Time-to-treatment failure (TTF) to EGFR TKI in patients identified as MET-high and -low was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Multiregion single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis was performed on 13 early-stage resected EGFR-mutant-positive NSCLC across 59 sectors to investigate intratumoral heterogeneity of MET CNG. RESULTS Fifty-two (26%) of 200 patients in the metastatic cohort were MET-high at diagnosis; 46 (23%) had polysomy and six (3%) had amplification. Median TTF was 12.2 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 22.6 months) versus 13.1 months (95% CI, 10.6 to 15.0 months) for MET-high and -low, respectively (P = .566), with no significant difference in response rate regardless of copy number thresholds. Loss of MET was observed in three of six patients identified as MET-high who underwent postprogression biopsies, which is consistent with marked intratumoral heterogeneity in MET CNG observed in early-stage tumors. Suboptimal response (TTF, 1.0 to 6.4 months) to EGFR TKI was observed in patients with coexisting MET amplification (five [3.2%] of 154). CONCLUSION Although up to 26% of TKI-naive EGFR-mutant-positive NSCLC harbor high MET CNG by fluorescence in situ hybridization, this did not significantly affect response to TKI, except in patients identified as MET-amplified. Our data underscore the limitations of adopting arbitrary copy number thresholds and the need for cross-assay validation to define therapeutically tractable MET pathway dysregulation in EGFR-mutant-positive NSCLC.

Here, we show that significant heterogeneity in the niche activity of MSCs is created during their culture in various serum-supplemented media. The MSCs cultured under stimulatory or non-stimulatory culture conditions exhibited differences in colony forming unit-fibroblast contents, expression levels of cross-talk molecules (Jagged-1 and CXCL-12) and their support for HSC self-renewal. Accordingly, the enhancing effects of MSCs on hematopoietic engraftment were only visible when HSCs were co-transplanted with MSCs under stimulatory conditions. Of note, these differences in MSCs and their effects on HSCs were readily reversed by switching the cultures, indicating that the difference in niche activity can be caused by distinct functional state, rather than by clonal heterogeneity. Supporting the findings, transcriptomic analysis showed distinct upstream signaling pathways such as inhibition of P53 and activation of ER-stress response gene ATF4 for MSCs under stimulatory conditions. Taken together, our study shows that the niche activity of MSCs can vary rapidly by the extrinsic cues during culture causing variable outcomes in hematopoietic recoveries, and point to the possibility that MSCs can be prescreened for more predictable efficacy in various cell therapy trials.																	1932-6203					DEC 28	2016	11	12							e0168036	10.1371/journal.pone.0168036							WOS:000391222000031	28030562

Toward absolute quantification of iron oxide nanoparticles as well as cell internalized fraction using multiparametric MRI	CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING												Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are widely used as MR contrast agents because of their strong magnetic properties and broad range of applications. The contrast induced by IONPs typically depends on concentration, water accessibility, particle size and heterogeneity of IONP distribution within the microenvironment. Although the latter could be a tool to assess local physiological effects at the molecular level, it renders IONP quantification from relaxation measurements challenging. This study aims to quantify IONP concentration using susceptibility measurements. In addition, further analysis of relaxation data is proposed to extract quantitative information about the IONP spatial distribution. Mesenchymal stem cells were labeled with IONPs and the IONP concentration measured by mass spectroscopy. MR relaxation parameters (T1, T2, T2*) as well as magnetic susceptibility of cylindrical samples containing serial dilutions of mixtures of free and cell-internalized IONPs were measured and correlated with IONP concentration. Unlike relaxation data, magnetic susceptibility was independent of whether IONPs were free or internalized, making it an excellent candidate for IONP quantification. Using IONP concentration derived from mass spectroscopy and measured relaxation times, free and internalized IONP fractions were accurately calculated. Magnetic susceptibility was shown to be a robust technique to measure IONP concentration in this preliminary study. Novel imaging-based susceptibility mapping techniques could prove to be valuable tools to quantify IONP concentration directly by MRI, for samples of arbitrary shape. Combined with relaxation time mapping techniques, especially T2 and T2*, this could be an efficient way to measure both IONP concentration and the internalized IONP fraction in vivo using MRI, to gain insight into tissue function and molecular imaging paradigms.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these two kinds of CTCs in MBC patients. Materials and Methods: We detected CTCs and pCTCs from 66 MBC patients using MACS immunomagnetic enrichment technology combined with immunocytochemistry (ICC). A cutoff score of 5 CTCs (or pCTCs) was set as a benchmark for prognosis in patients. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated and analyzed during the following 24 months. Results: We evaluated the sensitivity of this method and recovery rates of the CTCs by spiking experiments. The loss number of tumor cells by our method was 0-15. The population with fewer than 5 CTCs showed significantly higher PFS than the group with 5 or more CTCs. The difference in PFS between the patients with 5 or more pCTCs and those with fewer than 5 pCTCs was statistically significant. The presence of these pCTCs more accurately predicted poor prognosis than the CTCs that express cytokeratins. Conclusions: There is a subset of CTCs that lose epithelial markers such as pCTCs. Due to the heterogeneity of the expression of epithelial antigens in CTCs, different subtypes of CTCs exist. Independently of CTCs, the groups of patients with pCTCs had poorer prognoses.																	0973-1482	1998-4138				JAN-MAR	2013	9	1					29	37		10.4103/0973-1482.110353							WOS:000321897000008	23575071

Long-term in vitro maintenance of clonal abundance and leukaemia-initiating potential in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia	LEUKEMIA												Lack of suitable in vitro culture conditions for primary acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells severely impairs their experimental accessibility and the testing of new drugs on cell material reflecting clonal heterogeneity in patients. We show that Nestin-positive human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) support expansion of a range of biologically and clinically distinct patient-derived ALL samples. Adherent ALL cells showed an increased accumulation in the S phase of the cell cycle and diminished apoptosis when compared with cells in the suspension fraction. Moreover, surface expression of adhesion molecules CD34, CDH2 and CD10 increased several fold. Approximately 20% of the ALL cells were in G0 phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that MSCs may support quiescent ALL cells. Cellular barcoding demonstrated long-term preservation of clonal abundance. Expansion of ALL cells for 43 months compromised neither feeder dependence nor cancer initiating ability as judged by their engraftment potential in immunocompromised mice. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of this co-culture approach for the investigation of drug combinations with luciferase-expressing primograft ALL cells. Taken together, we have developed a preclinical platform with patient-derived material that will facilitate the development of clinically effective combination therapies for ALL.

J	Soliman, H; Rossi, FMV				Soliman, Hesham; Rossi, Fabio M., V			Cardiac fibroblast diversity in health and disease	MATRIX BIOLOGY												The cardiac stroma plays essential roles in health and following cardiac damage. The major player of the stroma with respect to extracellular matrix deposition, maintenance and remodeling is the poorly defined fibro-blast. It has long been recognized that there is considerable variability to the fibroblast phenotype. With the advent of new, high throughput analytical methods our understanding and appreciation of this heterogeneity has grown dramatically. This review aims to explore the diversity of cardiac fibroblasts and highlights new insights into the diverse nature of these cells and their progenitors as revealed by single cell sequencing and fate mapping studies. We propose that at least in part the observed heterogeneity is related to the existence of a differentiation cascade within stromal cells. Beyond in-organ heterogeneity, we also discuss how the stro-mal response to damage differs between non-regenerating organs such as the heart and regenerating organs such as skeletal muscle. In exploring possible causes for these differences, we outline that although fibro-genic cells from different organs overlap in many properties, they still possess organ-specific transcriptional signatures and differentiation biases that make them functionally distinct.

Murine Dermal Fibroblast Isolation by FACS	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Fibroblasts are the principle cell type responsible for secreting extracellular matrix and are a critical component of many organs and tissues. Fibroblast physiology and pathology underlie a spectrum of clinical entities, including fibroses in multiple organs, hypertrophic scarring following burns, loss of cardiac function following ischemia, and the formation of cancer stroma. However, fibroblasts remain a poorly characterized type of cell, largely due to their inherent heterogeneity. Existing methods for the isolation of fibroblasts require time in cell culture that profoundly influences cell phenotype and behavior. Consequently, many studies investigating fibroblast biology rely upon in vitro manipulation and do not accurately capture fibroblast behavior in vivo. To overcome this problem, we developed a FACS-based protocol for the isolation of fibroblasts from the dorsal skin of adult mice that does not require cell culture, thereby preserving the physiologic transcriptional and proteomic profile of each cell. Our strategy allows for exclusion of non-mesenchymal lineages via a lineage negative gate (Lin(-)) rather than a positive selection strategy to avoid pre-selection or enrichment of a subpopulation of fibroblasts expressing specific surface markers and be as inclusive as possible across this heterogeneous cell type.

J	Mercapide, J; Rappa, G; Lorico, A				Mercapide, Javier; Rappa, Germana; Lorico, Aurelio			The intrinsic fusogenicity of glioma cells as a factor of transformation and progression in the tumor microenvironment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER												We have previously reported in vitro heterotypic fusion of glioma cells with neural progenitor cells, producing tetraploid cells expressing genetic complements of each partner. Herein, we investigated the fusogenicity of glioma cells. In 1:1 cocultures of single-labeled cells, U87MG cells presented high frequency of homotypic fusogenic events, producing cells that coexpressed both fluorescent proteins. Six percent of the total cells had 8n DNA content, consistent with the finding that the double-labeled cells were actively proliferating. In coculture with fibroblasts, glioma cell fusogenicity resulted in viable reprogrammed cells, thus emerging as a plausible source of tumor cell heterogeneity. As for heterotypic fusion to happen, glioma cells have to establish direct contact with other cells, the effect of stroma on glioma cells was analyzed. Proliferation assays and array analysis of cancer-related pathways established a promalignant effect of stroma. This effect was mediated by fibronectin and was nearly completely abolished by inhibitors of the epidermal-growth-factor receptor. That stroma elicited transduction signaling through the mitogen-activated-protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway, which is linked to increased tumor cell migration through extracellular matrix, suggested that glioma cells may actively approach nontumor cells in stromal niches. According to these results, the fusogenicity of glioma cells emerged as an inherent factor for phenotypic changes leading to glioma progression.

Additive manufacturing by fused deposition modeling is a widely used technique to produce porous scaffolds with defined pore network, geometry, and therewith defined mechanical properties. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for tissue engineering-based cell therapies due to their multipotent character. One of the hurdles to overcome when combining additive manufactured scaffolds with MSCs is the resulting heterogeneous cell distribution and limited cell proliferation capacity. In this study, we show that the use of a biaxial rotating bioreactor, after static culture of human fetal MSCs (hfMSCs) seeded on synthetic polymeric scaffolds, improved the homogeneity of cell and extracellular matrix distribution and increased the total cell number. Furthermore, we show that the relative mRNA expression levels of indicators for stemness and differentiation are not significantly changed upon this bioreactor culture, whereas static culture shows variations of several indicators for stemness and differentiation. The biaxial rotating bioreactor presented here offers a homogeneous distribution of hfMSCs, enabling studies on MSCs fate in additive manufactured scaffolds without inducing undesired differentiation.

The pathogenesis of PPHN is very complex and can result from functional (vasoconstriction) or structural (arteriolar remodeling, reduced pulmonary vessels density) anomalies of pulmonary circulation. Etiopathogenetic factors heterogeneity can strongly condition therapeutical results and prognosis of PPHN that is particularly severe in organic forms that are usually refractory to selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy with inhaled nitric oxide. This paper reports the more recent acquisitions on molecular physiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying functional and structural forms of PPHN and illustrates the bases for adoption of new potential treatment strategies for organic PPHN. These strategies aim to reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling in PPHN with arteriolar smooth muscle hypertrophy and stimulate pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth in PPHN associated with lung hypoplasia. In order to restore lung growth in this severe form of PPHN, attention is focused on the results of studies of mesenchymal stem cells and their therapeutical paracrine effects on bronchopulmonry dysplasia, a chronic neonatal lung disease characterized by arrested vascular and alveolar growth and development of pulmonary hypertension.																	1720-8424	1824-7288				FEB 8	2015	41								6	10.1186/s13052-015-0111-0							WOS:000349349900001	25887340

However, post-injury cartilage repair is challenging and often requires medical intervention, which can be aided by 3D printed tissue engineering scaffolds. Specifically, the high accuracy of Melt Electro-Writing (MEW) technology facilitates the printing of scaffolds that imitate the structure and composition of natural cartilage to promote repair. Methods: MEW and Inkjet printing technology was employed to manufacture a composite scaffold that was then implanted into a cartilage injury site through microfracture surgery. While printing polycaprolactone (PCL) or PCL/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffolds, cytokine-containing microspheres were sprayed alternately to form multiple layers containing transforming growth factor-beta 1 and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (surface layer), insulin-like growth factor-1 (middle layer), and HA (deep layer). Results: The composite biological scaffold was conducive to adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells recruited from the bone marrow and blood. Meanwhile, the environmental differences between the scaffold's layers contributed to the regional heterogeneity of chondrocytes and secreted proteins to promote functional cartilage regeneration. The biological effect of the composite scaffold was validated both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: A cartilage repair scaffold was established with high precision as well as promising mechanical and biological properties. This scaffold can promote the repair of cartilage injury by using, and inducing the differentiation and expression of, autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

Heterogeneity and phenotypic changes in SMCs are usually accompanied by a morphological difference, i.e., elongated/spindle-like versus spread-out or epithelioid/rhomboid cell shapes. However, it is not known whether the cell shape directly regulates SMC proliferation, and what the underlying mechanisms are. In this study, microgrooves and micropatterned matrix islands were used to engineer the cell shape and investigate the associated biophysical and biological mechanisms. Compared to spread-out SMCs on nonpatterned surfaces, SMCs on micropatterned surfaces demonstrated elongated morphology, significantly lower cell and nucleus shape indexes, less spreading, a lower proliferation rate, and a similar response (but to a lesser extent) to platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, and mechanical stretching. DNA microarray profiling revealed a lower expression of neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1) in elongated SMCs. Knocking down NOR-1 suppressed DNA synthesis in SMCs, suggesting that NOR-1 is a mediator of cell elongation effects. Regulation of DNA synthesis in SMCs by the cell shape alone and a decrease in DNA synthesis in the case of small cell spreading area were achieved by micropatterning SMCs on matrix islands of different shapes and spreading areas. Changes in the cell shape also affected the nucleus shape, whereas variations in the cell spreading area modulated the nucleus volume, indicating a possible link between nucleus morphology (both shape and volume) and DNA synthesis. The findings of this investigation provide insight into cell shape effects on cell structure and proliferation, and have direct implications for vascular pathophysiology.

We report that bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are recruited to primary breast tumors and to lung metastases and differentiate to a distinct subpopulation of CAFs. We show that BM-derived CAFs are functionally important for tumor growth and enhance angiogenesis via up-regulation of Clusterin. Using newly generated transgenic mice and adoptive BM transplantations, we demonstrate that BM-derived fibroblasts are a substantial source of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Unlike resident CAFs, BM-derived CAFs do not express PDGFR alpha, and their recruitment resulted in a decrease in the percentage of PDGFR alpha-expressing CAFs. Strikingly, decrease in PDGFR alpha in breast cancer patients was associated with worse prognosis, suggesting that BM-derived CAFs may have deleterious effects on survival. Therefore, PDGFR alpha expression distinguishes two functionally unique CAF populations in breast tumors and metastases and may have important implications for patient stratification and precision therapeutics.

SMAD4 genetic loss is frequent in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Reports of SMAD4 expression in SCCs vary significantly possibly due to inter-tumor heterogeneity or technical reasons. SMAD4 loss is an initiation event for SCCs. In tumor epithelial cells, SMAD4 loss causes increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and "Brca-like" genomic instability associated with DNA repair defects. SMAD4 loss also plays a role in the expansion of cancer stem cells. Epithelial SMAD4 loss causes overexpression of TGF ss that is released into the tumor microenvironment and contributes to SCC progression through proinflammatory and immune evasive mechanisms. SMAD4 loss, while not a direct therapeutic target, is associated with multiple targetable pathways that require further therapeutic studies. Altogether, SMAD4 loss is a potential biomarker in SCCs that should be further studied for its values in prognostic and therapeutic predictions. Such information will potentially guide future biomarker-driven clinical trial designs and improve SCC patient outcomes.

Premalignant Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells Stall in a Heterogeneous State of Replication Stress Prior to Gliomagenesis	CANCER RESEARCH												Cancer evolves from premalignant clones that adopt unusual cell states to achieve transformation. We previously pinpointed the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) as a cell of origin for glioma, but the early changes of mutant OPCs during premalignancy remained unknown. Using mice engineered for inducible Nf1-Trp53 loss in OPCs, we acutely isolated labeled mutant OPCs by laser-capture microdissection, determined global gene-expression changes by bulk RNA sequencing, and compared with cell-state fluctuations at the single-cell level by stochastic profiling, which uses RNA-sequencing measurements from random pools of 10 mutant cells. At 12 days after Nf1-Trp53 deletion, bulk differences were mostly limited to mitotic hallmarks and genes for ribosome biosynthesis, and stochastic profiling revealed a spectrum of stem-progenitor (Axl, Aldh1a1), proneural, and mesenchymal states as potential starting points for gliomagenesis. At 90 days, bulk sequencing detected few differentially expressed transcripts, whereas stochastic profiling revealed cell states for neurons and mural cells that do not give rise to glial tumors, suggesting cellular dead-ends for gliomagenesis. Importantly, mutant OPCs that strongly expressed key effectors of nonsense-mediated decay (Upf3b) and homologydependent DNA repair (Rad51c, Slx1b, Ercc4) were identified along with DNA-damage markers, suggesting transcription-associated replication stress. Analysis of 10-cell transcriptomes at 90 days identified a locus of elevated gene expression containing an additional repair endonuclease (Mus81) and Rin1, a Ras-Raf antagonist and possible counterbalance to Nf1 loss, which was microdeleted or downregulated in gliomas at 150 days. These hidden cell-state variations uncover replication stress as a potential bottleneck that must be resolved for glioma initiation. Significance: Profiling premalignant cell states in a mouse model of glioma uncovers regulatory heterogeneity in glioma cells-of-origin and defines a state of replication stress that precedes tumor initiation.

Defining lineage origins of reparative fibroblasts and regulatory programs that drive fibrosis or, conversely, promote regeneration will be essential for improving healing outcomes. Using complementary fate-mapping approaches, we show that hair follicle mesenchymal progenitors make limited contributions to wound repair. In contrast, extrafollicular progenitors marked by the quiescence-associated factor Hic1 generated the bulk of reparative fibroblasts and exhibited functional divergence, mediating regeneration in the center of the wound neodermis and scar formation in the periphery. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed unique transcriptional, regulatory, and epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk signatures that enabled mesenchymal competence for regeneration. Integration with scATAC-seq highlighted changes in chromatin accessibility within regeneration-associated loci. Finally, pharmacological modulation of RUNX1 and retinoic acid signaling or genetic deletion of Hic1 within wound-activated fibroblasts was sufficient to modulate healing outcomes, suggesting that reparative fibroblasts have latent but modifiable regenerative capacity.

Multiplex Gene Expression Profiling of In Vivo Isolated Circulating Tumor Cells in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients	CLINICAL CHEMISTRY												BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is important for selecting patients for targeted treatments. We present, for the first time, results on gene expression profiling of CTCs isolated in vivo from high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients compared with CTC detected by 3 protein-based assays-CellSearch (R), PSA-EPISPOT, and immunofluorescence of CellCollector (R) in vivo-captured CTCs-using the same blood draw. METHODS: EpCAM-positive CTCs were isolated in vivo using the CellCollector from 108 high-risk PCa patients and 36 healthy volunteers. For 27 patients, samples were available before and after treatment. We developed highly sensitive multiplex RT-qPCR assays for 14 genes (KRT19, EpCAM, CDH1, HMBS, PSCA, ALDH1A1, PROM1, HPRT1, TWIST1, VIM, CDH2, B2M, PLS3, and PSA), including epithelial markers, stem cell markers, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) markers. RESULTS: We observed high heterogeneity in gene expression in the captured CTCs for each patient. At least 1 marker was detected in 74 of 105 patients (70.5%), 2 markers in 45 of 105 (40.9%), and 3 markers in 16 of 105 (15.2%). Epithelial markers were detected in 31 of 105 (29.5%) patients, EMT markers in 46 of 105 (43.8%), and stem cell markers in 15 of 105 (14.3%) patients. EMT-marker positivity was very low before therapy (2 of 27, 7.4%), but it increased after therapy (17 of 27, 63.0%), whereas epithelial markers tended to decrease after therapy (2 of 27, 7.4%) compared with before therapy (13 of 27, 48.1%). At least 2 markers were ex-pressed in 40.9% of patients, whereas the positivity was 19.6% for CellSearch, 38.1% for EPISPOT, and 43.8% for CellCollector-based IF-staining. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of in vivo CTC isolation with downstream RNA analysis is highly promising as a high-throughput, specific, and ultrasensitive approach for multiplex liquid biopsy-based molecular diagnostics.

In vitro induction of alkaline phosphatase levels predicts in vivo bone forming capacity of human bone marrow stromal cells	STEM CELL RESEARCH												One of the applications of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that are produced by ex vivo expansion is for use in in vivo bone tissue engineering. Cultured stromal cells are a mixture of cells at different stages of commitment and expansion capability, leading to a heterogeneous cell population that each time can differ in the potential to form in vivo bone. A parameter that predicts for in vivo bone forming capacity is thus far lacking. We employed single colony-derived BMSC cultures to identify such predictive parameters. Using limiting dilution, we have produced sixteen single CFU-F derived BMSC cultures from human bone marrow and found that only five of these formed bone in vivo. The single colony-derived BMSC strains were tested for proliferation, osteogenic-, adipogenic-and chondrogenic differentiation capacity and the expression of a variety of associated markers. The only robust predictors of in vivo bone forming capacity were the induction of alkaline phosphatase, (ALP) mRNA levels and ALP activity during in vitro osteogenic differentiation. The predictive value of in vitro ALP induction was confirmed by analyzing "bulk-cultured" BMSCs from various bone marrow biopsies. Our findings show that in BMSCs, the additional increase in ALP levels over basal levels during in vitro osteogenic differentiation is predictive of in vivo performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

A novel single-cell based method for breast cancer prognosis	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method,scPrognosis, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data.scPrognosisuses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show thatscPrognosisoutperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer.scPrognosiswill also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT. Author summary Various computational methods have been developed for breast cancer prognosis. However, those methods mainly use the gene expression data generated by the bulk RNA sequencing techniques, which average the expression level of a gene across different cell types. As breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, the bulk gene expression may not be the ideal resource for cancer prognosis. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve breast cancer prognosis using scRNA-seq data. The proposed method has been applied to the EMT scRNA-seq dataset for identifying breast cancer signatures for prognosis. In comparison with existing bulk expression data based methods in breast cancer prognosis, our method shows a better performance. Our single-cell-based signatures provide clues to the relation between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.

Here, we investigate how transcriptional changes in bone marrow (BM) MSCs result in long-lasting effects on HSCs. Single-cell analysis of Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and PDGFR alpha(+)Sca1(+) (P alpha S) cells revealed an extensive cellular heterogeneity but uniform expression of the transcription factor gene Ebf1. Conditional deletion of Ebf1 in these MSCs altered their cellular composition, chromatin structure and gene expression profiles, including the reduced expression of adhesion-related genes. Functionally, the stromal-specific Ebf1 inactivation results in impaired adhesion of HSCs, leading to reduced quiescence and diminished myeloid output. Most notably, HSCs residing in the Ebf1-deficient niche underwent changes in their cellular composition and chromatin structure that persist in serial transplantations. Thus, genetic alterations in the BM niche lead to long-term functional changes of HSCs. Grosschedl and colleagues identify a role for the transcription factor EBF1 in bone marrow stromal cells that is required to maintain the niche to support hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoiesis.

Molecular Biomarker Analyses Using Circulating Tumor Cells	PLOS ONE												Background: Evaluation of cancer biomarkers from blood could significantly enable biomarker assessment by providing a relatively non-invasive source of representative tumor material. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) isolated from blood of metastatic cancer patients hold significant promise in this regard. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using spiked tumor-cells we evaluated CTC capture on different CTC technology platforms, including CellSearch (R) and two biochip platforms, and used the isolated CTCs to develop and optimize assays for molecular characterization of CTCs. We report similar performance for the various platforms tested in capturing CTCs, and find that capture efficiency is dependent on the level of EpCAM expression. We demonstrate that captured CTCs are amenable to biomarker analyses such as HER2 status, qRT-PCR for breast cancer subtype markers, KRAS mutation detection, and EGFR staining by immunofluorescence (IF). We quantify cell surface expression of EGFR in metastatic lung cancer patient samples. In addition, we determined HER2 status by IF and FISH in CTCs from metastatic breast cancer patients. In the majority of patients (89%) we found concordance with HER2 status from patient tumor tissue, though in a subset of patients (11%), HER2 status in CTCs differed from that observed in the primary tumor. Surprisingly, we found CTC counts to be higher in ER+ patients in comparison to HER2+ and triple negative patients, which could be explained by low EpCAM expression and a more mesenchymal phenotype of tumors belonging to the basal-like molecular subtype of breast cancer. Conclusions/Significance: Our data suggests that molecular characterization from captured CTCs is possible and can potentially provide real-time information on biomarker status. In this regard, CTCs hold significant promise as a source of tumor material to facilitate clinical biomarker evaluation. However, limitations exist from a purely EpCAM based capture system and addition of antibodies to mesenchymal markers could further improve CTC capture efficiency to enable routine biomarker analysis from CTCs.

Our study aimed to evaluate variations between sources of hPL and to explore the efficacy of hPL (with and without heparin) as a replacement for FBS in culturing human corneal endothelial cells in vitro. Immortalized human corneal endothelial cells (B4G12) and primary human corneal endothelial cells (PHCEnCs, n = 11 donors, age from 36 to 85 years old) were cultured with 5% hPL or FBS. A full characterisation of the effects of hPL and FBS on cell growth was conducted using IncuCyte Zoom (percentage cell confluence and population doubling time, PDT) to analyse cell proliferation. AlamarBlue assays were used to measure cell viability. The concentration of fibrinogen, PDGF, hEGF, VEGF and bFGF in two sources of hPL were analyzed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression and localization of Na+/K+-ATPase, ZO-1 and CD166 on PHCEnCs and B4G12 cells were assessed with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Our results showed that a significant difference in fibrinogen, hEGF and VEGF concentrations was found between two sources of hPL. Heparin impaired the positive effect of hPL on cell growth. PDT and alamarBlue showed that hPL significantly increased proliferation and viability of PHCEnCs in two of three donors, and immunostaining indicated that hPL increased ZO-1 and CD166 expression but not Na+/K+-ATPase on PHCEnCs. In addition, heterogeneities on immunopositivity of Na+/K+ATPase and ZO-1 and morphology were found on PHCEnCs derived from an individual donor cultured with hPL medium. In conclusion, hPL showed positive effect on primary corneal endothelial cell growth, and maintenance of their cellular characteristics compared to FBS. hPL can be considered as a supplement to replace FBS in PHCEnC culture. However, the variation observed between different hPL sources suggests that a standard quality control monitoring system such as storage time and a minimal concentration of growth factors may need to be established.

New approach to measuring oxygen diffusion and consumption in encapsulated living cells, based on electron spin resonance microscopy	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												Cell microencapsulation within biocompatible polymers is an established technology for immobilizing living cells that secrete therapeutic products. These can be transplanted into a desired site in the body for the controlled and continuous delivery of the therapeutic molecules. One of the most important properties of the material that makes up the microcapsule is its oxygen penetrability, which is critical for the cells' survival. Oxygen reaches the cells inside the microcapsules via a diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient for the microcapsules' gel material is commonly measured using bulk techniques, where the gel in a chamber is first flushed with nitrogen and the subsequent rate of oxygen diffusion back into it is measured by an oxygen electrode placed in the chamber. This technique does not address possible heterogeneities between microcapsules, and also cannot reveal O-2 heterogeneity inside the microcapsule resulting from the living cells' activity. Here we develop and demonstrate a proof of principle for a new approach to measuring and imaging the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) inside a single microcapsule by means of high-resolution and high-sensitivity electron spin resonance (ESR). The proposed methodology makes use of biocompatible paramagnetic microparticulates intercalated inside the microcapsule during its preparation. The new ESR approach was used to measure the O-2 diffusion properties of two types of gel materials (alginate and extracellular matrix - ECM), as well as to map a 3D image of the oxygen inside single microcapsules with living cells. Statement of Significance The technology of cell microencapsulation offers major advantages in the sustained delivery of therapeutic agents used for the treatment of various diseases ranging from diabetes to cancer. Despite the great advances made in this field, it still faces substantial challenges, preventing it from reaching the clinical practice. One of the primary challenges in developing cell microencapsulation systems is providing the cells with adequate supply of oxygen in the long term. Nevertheless, there is still no methodology good enough for measuring 02 distribution inside the microcapsule with sufficient accuracy and spatial resolution without affecting the microcapsule and/or the cells' activity in it. In the present work, we introduce a novel magnetic resonance technique to address 02 availability within cell-entrapping microcapsules. For the first time 02 distribution can be accurately measured and imaged within a single microcapsule. This new technique may be an efficient tool in the development of more optimal microencapsulation systems in the future, thus bringing this promising field closer to clinical application.

We speculate that neoplastic spindle cells, which are prominently found in the invasive tumor front and the surrounding stroma, might be responsible for the aggressive patterns. Expression profiling of various biomarkers relevant to cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was performed by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry in NPC samples. The expression of EBER and LMP1 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We found that overexpression of CSCs-related markers (ALDH1, Nanog and ABCG2) and up-regulation of EMT markers (Fibronectin, MMP-2, Periostin, SPARC, Snail and Slug), together with E-to N-cadherin switching, occurred preferentially in tumors containing a large proportion of spindle-shaped malignant cells. Furthermore, CSCs-like properties were highly present in spindle cells compared with non-spindle cells of tumors, and correlated strongly with EMT features. In addition, EBV-related factors EBER and LMP1 were highly expressed and correlated strongly with CSCs and EMT characteristics in neoplastic spindle cells. Importantly, high proportion of spindle cells (>= 20%) correlated significantly with various aggressive aspects including lymph node metastasis (P = 0.031) and local recurrence (P = 0.014). Patients with high proportion of spindle cells had poor survival (P = 0.004), though it was not an independent value. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spindle cells could be valuable morphological indicators of tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis of NPC. An integrated molecule-morphology model of NPC firstly constructed may shed significant light on the metastatic cascade and clinical relevance of patients.

Cancer metabolism in space and time: Beyond the Warburg effect	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS												Altered metabolism in cancer cells is pivotal for tumor growth, most notably by providing energy, reducing equivalents and building blocks while several metabolites exert a signaling function promoting tumor growth and progression. A cancer tissue cannot be simply reduced to a bulk of proliferating cells. Tumors are indeed complex and dynamic structures where single cells can heterogeneously perform various biological activities with different metabolic requirements. Because tumors are composed of different types of cells with metabolic activities affected by different spatial and temporal contexts, it is important to address metabolism taking into account cellular and biological heterogeneity. In this review, we describe this heterogeneity also in metabolic fluxes, thus showing the relative contribution of different metabolic activities to tumor progression according to the cellular context.

Physical alterations driven by increased proliferation of neoplastic cells and angiogenesis in the cancer microenvironment result in the exposure of the cancer cells to elevated levels of flow-based shear stress. We developed a dynamic microfluidic cell culture platform utilizing eshopagael cancer cells as model cells to investigate the phenotypic changes of cancer cells upon exposure to fluid shear stress. We report the epithelial to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal transition as a result of decreasing E-Cadherin and increasing N-Cadherin and vimentin expressions, higher clonogenicity and ALDH positive expression of cancer cells cultured in a dynamic microfluidic chip under laminar flow compared to the static culture condition. We also sought regulation of chemotherapeutics in cancer microenvironment towards phenotypic control of cancer cells. Such in vitro microfluidic system could potentially be used to monitor how the interstitial fluid dynamics affect cancer microenvironment and plasticity on a simple, highly controllable and inexpensive bioengineered platform.

Molecular analysis reveals a genetic basis for the phenotypic diversity of metaplastic breast carcinomas	JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY												Cancers may be composed of multiple populations of submodal clones sharing the same initiating genetic lesions, followed by the acquisition of divergent genetic hits. Intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity has profound implications for cancer clinical management. To determine the extent of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity in breast cancers, and whether the morphological diversity of breast cancers is underpinned by divergent genetic aberrations, we analysed the genomic profiles of microdissected, morphologically distinct components of six metaplastic breast carcinomas, tumours characterized by the presence of morphological areas with divergent differentiation. Each morphologically distinct component was separately microdissected and subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Each component was also analysed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Clonal relationship between the distinct components was tested by TP53 sequencing and human androgen receptor (HUMARA) X-chromosome inactivation assay. In the majority of cases, all morphologically distinct components from each case were clonal and displayed remarkably similar genetic profiles. In two cases, however, morphologically distinct components harboured specific genetic aberrations. In an adenosquamous carcinoma, the differences were such that only 20% of the genome harboured similar copy number changes. The squamous component displayed EGFR gene amplification, EGFR over-expression and lack of expression of hormone receptors, whereas the lobular component displayed the reverse pattern. The components of a biphasic spindle cell carcinoma harboured similar gains, losses, amplifications of 9p23 and 17q12 (HER2) and identical TP53 mutations, suggesting that these were relatively early events in the development of this tumour; however, each component displayed divergent focal amplifications. Importantly, the metastatic deposit of this case, despite harbouring a TP53 mutation identical to that found in the primary tumour, harboured additional specific focal amplifications. This proof-of-principle study provides direct evidence of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity in breast cancers, and shows that in some cases morphological diversity may be underpinned by distinct genetic aberrations.

Creating Physicochemical Gradients in Modular Microporous Annealed Particle Hydrogels via a Microfluidic Method	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Microporous annealed particle (MAP) hydrogels are an attractive platform for engineering biomaterials with controlled heterogeneity. Here, a microfluidic method is introduced to create physicochemical gradients within poly(ethylene glycol) based MAP hydrogels. By combining microfluidic mixing and droplet generator modules, microgels with varying properties are produced by adjusting the relative flow rates between two precursor solutions and collected layer-by-layer in a syringe. Subsequently, the microgels are injected out of the syringe and then annealed with thiol-ene click chemistry. Fluorescence intensity measurements of constructs annealed in vitro and after mock implantation into a tissue defect show that a continuous gradient profile is achieved and maintained after injection, indicating utility for in situ hydrogel formation. The effects of physicochemical property gradients on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are also studied. Microgel stiffness is studied first, and the hMSCs exhibit increased spreading and proliferation as stiffness increased along the gradient. Microgel degradability is also studied, revealing a critical degradability threshold above which the hMSCs spread robustly and below which they are isolated and exhibit reduced spreading. This method of generating spatial gradients in MAP hydrogels can be further used to gain new insights into cell-material interactions, which can be leveraged for tissue engineering applications.

Chemotherapy activates cancer-associated fibroblasts to maintain colorectal cancer-initiating cells by IL-17A	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE												Many solid cancers display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing, tumorigenic stemlike cells, or cancer-initiating cells (CICs) at the apex. Whereas CICs often exhibit relative resistance to conventional cancer therapies, they also receive critical maintenance cues from supportive stromal elements that also respond to cytotoxic therapies. To interrogate the interplay between chemotherapy and CICs, we investigated cellular heterogeneity in human colorectal cancers. Colorectal CICs were resistant to conventional chemotherapy in cell-autonomous assays, but CIC chemoresistance was also increased by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Comparative analysis of matched colorectal cancer specimens from patients before and after cytotoxic treatment revealed a significant increase in CAFs. Chemotherapy-treated human CAFs promoted CIC self-renewal and in vivo tumor growth associated with increased secretion of specific cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Exogenous IL-17A increased CIC self-renewal and invasion, and targeting IL-17A signaling impaired CIC growth. Notably, IL-17A was overexpressed by colorectal CAFs in response to chemotherapy with expression validated directly in patient-derived specimens without culture. These data suggest that chemotherapy induces remodeling of the tumor microenvironment to support the tumor cellular hierarchy through secreted factors. Incorporating simultaneous disruption of CIC mechanisms and interplay with the tumor microenvironment could optimize therapeutic targeting of cancer.

Identification of genomic signatures in circulating tumor cells from breast cancer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER												Levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood have prognostic value in early and metastatic breast cancer. CTCs also show varying degrees of concordance with molecular markers of primary tumors they originate from. It is expected that individual cells reflect the heterogeneity and evolution of tumor cells as they acquire new functions and differential responses to chemotherapy. However, a degree of commonality is also plausible, highlighting alterations that allow tumor cells to perform CTC-defining activities such as invasion and intravasation. Using a matched tumor-normal approach, we performed high-resolution copy number profiling of CTCs from breast cancer to identify occult changes occurring during progression to metastasis. We identified a signature of recurrent gain in CTCs, consisting of 90 minimal common regions (MCRs) of copy number gain. These were predominantly found across chromosome 19 and were identified at low frequencies (3-4%) in 787 primary breast carcinomas examined. CTC genomic signatures clustered into two groups independent of subtype: a dormancy-related signature with 16 MCRs (AKT2, PTEN, CADM2); and a tumor-aggressiveness related signature with 358 MCRs (ANGPTL4, BSG, MIR-373). There were two MCRs in common between the groups on 19q13 and 21q21, containing genes involved in resistance to anoikis, TGF-signaling and metastasis (TFF3, LTBP4, NUMBL). Furthermore, a region harboring the ERBB2 gene was gained in a majority of patients. Regions 20q13 and 15q24 were associated with distant metastasis. The distinctiveness of CTC signatures highlights cell populations with different functional or metastatic potential. Such novel targets could help to specifically identify and block dissemination. What's new? People die of breast cancer not from the primary tumors, but because of uncontrolled metastasis, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could be the key to detecting it. In this paper, the authors examined the DNA of CTCs looking for identifying features that could help spot these harbingers of metastasis. They found certain copy number changes, predominantly on chromosome 19 that may indicate the cell's ability to travel. The changes fell into two categories: one associated with dormancy, the other with tumor aggressiveness. Detection of these genetic signatures could help target the most mobile cells and thwart metastasis.

Here, we report a microfluidics-based, patientspecific 'GBM-on-a-Chip' microphysiological system to dissect the heterogeneity of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and optimize anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for different GBM subtypes. Our clinical and experimental analyses demonstrated that molecularly distinct GBM subtypes have distinct epigenetic and immune signatures that may lead to different immunosuppressive mechanisms. The real-time analysis in GBM-on-a-Chip showed that mesenchymal GBM niche attracted low number of allogeneic CD154+CD8+ T-cells but abundant CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and expressed elevated PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints and TGF-beta 1, IL-10, and CSF-1 cytokines compared to proneural GBM. To enhance PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab efficacy, we co-administered a CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 to ablate CD163+ M2-TAMs and strengthened CD154+CD8+ T-cell functionality and GBM apoptosis on-chip. Our ex vivo patient-specific GBM-on-a-Chip provides an avenue for a personalized screening of immunotherapies for GBM patients.

However, a "division of labor" leading to cooperation among tumor-cell subpopulations could be an additional catalyst of progression. Using a zebrafish-melanoma xenograft model, we found that in a heterogeneous setting, inherently invasive cells, which possess protease activity and deposit extracellular matrix (ECM), co-invade with subpopulations of poorly invasive cells, a phenomenon we term "cooperative invasion". Whereas the poorly invasive cells benefit from heterogeneity, the invasive cells switch from protease-independent to an MT1-MMP-dependent mode of invasion. We did not observe changes in expression of the melanoma phenotype determinant MITF during cooperative invasion, thus ruling out the necessity for phenotype switching for invasion. Altogether, our data suggest that cooperation can drive melanoma progression without the need for clonal selection or phenotype switching and can account for the preservation of heterogeneity seen throughout tumor progression.

VEGF-C mediates tumor growth and metastasis through promoting EMT-epithelial breast cancer cell crosstalk	ONCOGENE												It is well established that a subset of cells within primary breast cancers can undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), although the role of EMT in metastasis remains controversial. We previously demonstrated that breast cancer cells that had undergone an oncogenic EMT could increase metastasis of neighboring cancer cells via non-canonical paracrine-mediated activation of GLI activity that is dependent on SIX1 expression in the EMT cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which these SIX1-expressing EMT cells activate GLI signaling remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for activation of GLI-mediated signaling in epithelial breast tumor cells via EMT cell-induced production and secretion of VEGF-C. We show that VEGF-C, secreted by breast cancer cells that have undergone an EMT, promotes paracrine-mediated increases in proliferation, migration, and invasion of epithelial breast cancer cells, via non-canonical activation of GLI-signaling. We further show that the aggressive phenotypes, including metastasis, imparted by EMT cells on adjacent epithelial cancer cells can be disrupted by either inhibiting VEGF-C in EMT cells or by knocking down NRP2, a receptor which interacts with VEGF-C, in neighboring epithelial cancer cells. Interrogation of TCGA and GEO public datasets supports the relevance of this pathway in human breast cancer, demonstrating that VEGF-C strongly correlates with activation of Hedgehog signaling and EMT in the human disease. Our study suggests that the VEGF-C/NRP2/GLI axis is a novel and conserved paracrine means by which EMT cells enhance metastasis, and provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this heterogeneous disease.

Here we show that patient-derived glioma sphere cultures (GSCs) that resemble either the proneural (PN) or nnesenchymal (MES) transcriptomal subtypes differ significantly in their biological characteristics. Moreover, we found that a subset of the PN GSCs undergoes differentiation to a MES state in a TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B-dependent manner with an associated enrichment of CD44 subpopulations and radioresistant phenotypes. We present data to suggest that the tumor microenvironment cell types such as macrophages/microglia may play an integral role in this process.

Tetraspanins are unevenly distributed across single extracellular vesicles and bias sensitivity to multiplexed cancer biomarkers	JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY												Background: Tetraspanin expression of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is often used as a surrogate for their detection and classification, a practice that typically assumes their consistent expression across EV sources. Results: Here we demonstrate that there are distinct patterns in colocalization of tetraspanin expression of EVs enriched from a variety of in vitro and in vivo sources. We report an optimized method for the use of single particle antibody-capture and fluorescence detection to identify subpopulations according to tetraspanin expression and compare our findings with nanoscale flow cytometry. We found that tetraspanin profile is consistent from a given EV source regardless of isolation method, but that tetraspanin profiles are distinct across various sources. Tetraspanin profiles measured by flow cytometry do not totally agree, suggesting that limitations in subpopulation detection significantly impact apparent protein expression. We further analyzed tetraspanin expression of single EVs captured non-specifically, revealing that tetraspanin capture can bias the apparent multiplexed tetraspanin profile. Finally, we demonstrate that this bias can have significant impact on diagnostic sensitivity for tumor-associated EV surface markers. Conclusion: Our findings may reveal key insights into protein expression heterogeneity of EVs that better inform EV capture and detection platforms for diagnostic or other downstream use.

We found CDK4 to be highly expressed in these tumors and its expression to correlate with poor overall and relapse free survival outcomes, high tumor grade and poor prognostic features of triple negative breast cancer patients. Moreover, we found that blocking CDK4 expression or kinase activity, using a pharmacological inhibitor prevented breast cancer stem cell self-renewal. Interestingly, suppression of CDK4 expression or kinase activity reversed the basal-B TNBC mesenchymal phenotype to an epithelial-and luminal-like phenotype which correlates with better clinical prognosis. Finally, blocking CDK4 activity efficiently eliminated both normal and chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells in triple negative breast cancers, highlighting CDK4 as a promising novel therapeutic target for these aggressive breast tumors.

A SNAI2-PEAK1-INHBA stromal axis drives progression and lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer by supporting subpopulations of tumor cells positive for antiapoptotic and stress signaling markers	ONCOGENE												Intercellular mechanisms by which the stromal microenvironment contributes to solid tumor progression and targeted therapy resistance remain poorly understood, presenting significant clinical hurdles. PEAK1 (Pseudopodium-Enriched Atypical Kinase One) is an actin cytoskeleton- and focal adhesion-associated pseudokinase that promotes cell state plasticity and cancer metastasis by mediating growth factor-integrin signaling crosstalk. Here, we determined that stromal PEAK1 expression predicts poor outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancers high in SNAI2 expression and enriched for MSC content. Specifically, we identified that the fibroblastic stroma in HER2-positive breast cancer patient tissue stains positive for both nuclear SNAI2 and cytoplasmic PEAK1. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high PEAK1 protein levels and potentiate tumorigenesis, lapatinib resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer cells in a PEAK1-dependent manner. Analysis of PEAK1-dependent secreted factors from MSCs revealed INHBA/activin-A as a necessary factor in the conditioned media of PEAK1-expressing MSCs that promotes lapatinib resistance. Single-cell CycIF analysis of MSC-breast cancer cell co-cultures identified enrichment of p-Akt(high)/p-gH2AX(low), MCL1(high)/p-gH2AX(low) and GRP78(high)/VIMhigh breast cancer cell subpopulations by the presence of PEAK1-expressing MSCs and lapatinib treatment. Bioinformatic analyses on a PEAK1-centric stroma-tumor cell gene set and follow-up immunostaining of co-cultures predict targeting antiapoptotic and stress pathways as a means to improve targeted therapy responses and patient outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer and other stroma-rich malignancies. These data provide the first evidence that PEAK1 promotes tumorigenic phenotypes through a previously unrecognized SNAI2-PEAK1-INHBA stromal cell axis.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) promotes self-renewal and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) induces differentiation of GSCs. BMP7 induces the transcription factor Snail to promote astrocytic differentiation in GSCs and suppress tumor growth in vivo. We demonstrate that Snail represses stemness in GSCs. Snail interacts with SMAD signaling mediators, generates a positive feedback loop of BMP signaling and transcriptionally represses the TGFB1 gene, decreasing TGF beta 1 signaling activity. Exogenous TGF beta 1 counteracts Snail function in vitro, and in vivo promotes proliferation and re-expression of Nestin, confirming the importance of TGFB1 gene repression by Snail. In conclusion, novel insight highlights mechanisms whereby Snail differentially regulates the activity of the opposing BMP and TGF beta pathways, thus promoting an astrocytic fate switch and repressing stemness in GSCs.

Squamous cell carcinoma is caused by tobacco use, alcohol consumption and infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus. It is the 6th most common cancer in the world, with upwards of 45,000 new cases reported yearly in the United States alone. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the understanding of the molecular and genetic pathogenesis of head and neck cancer, shedding light on the unexpected heterogeneity of the disease. Genetic analysis has led to new classification schemes for HNSCC, with different subgroups exhibiting different prognoses. In addition, multiple targets in aberrant signaling pathways have been identified using increasingly sophisticated bio-informatics tools. Advances in technology have allowed for novel delivery mechanisms to introduce genetic material into cells to produce a therapeutic effect by targeting cancer cells via a number of different approaches. A pressing need to develop novel therapies to augment current treatment modalities has led to a number of translational studies involving gene therapy in the treatment of HNSCC. This article will focus on a review of the most recent developments in molecular biology of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in regards to possible targets for gene therapy, as well as the array of novel therapeutic strategies directed at these targets.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-1-4614-6176-0; 978-1-4614-6175-3				2013	779						165	177		10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0_7	10.1007/978-1-4614-6176-0						WOS:000334203100008	23288639

Here we show that TGF beta increases breast tumour-initiating cell (BTIC) numbers but only in claudin(low) breast cancer cell lines by orchestrating a specific gene signature enriched in stem cell processes that predicts worse clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. NEDD9, a member of the Cas family of integrin scaffold proteins, is necessary to mediate these TGF beta-specific effects through a positive feedback loop that integrates TGF beta/Smad and Rho-actin-SRF-dependent signals. In normal human mammary epithelium, TGF beta induces progenitor activity only in the basal/stem cell compartment, where claudin(low) cancers are presumed to arise. These data show opposing responses to TGF beta in both breast malignant cell subtypes and normal mammary epithelial cell subpopulations and suggest therapeutic strategies for a subset of human breast cancers.

Here, we identified a role for thymidylate synthase (TS), a NM enzyme and established drug target, in cancer cell de-differentiation and investigated its clinical significance in breast cancer (BC). In vitro, TS knockdown increased the population of CD24(+) differentiated cells, and attenuated migration and sphere-formation. RNA-seq profiling indicated repression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes upon TS knockdown, and TS-deficient cells showed an increased ability to invade and metastasize in vivo, consistent with the occurrence of a partial EMT phenotype. Mechanistically, TS enzymatic activity was found essential for maintenance of the EMT/stem-like state by fueling a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase-dependent pyrimidine catabolism. In patient tissues, TS levels were found significantly higher in poorly differentiated and in triple negative BC, and strongly correlated with worse prognosis. The present study provides the rationale to study in-depth the role of NM at the crossroads of proliferation and differentiation, and depicts new avenues for the design of novel drug combinations for the treatment of BC.

Recent advances in understanding cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY												Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease with a poor survival rate. It is resistant to therapy in part due to its unique tumor microenvironment, characterized by a desmoplastic reaction resulting in a dense stroma that constitutes a large fraction of the tumor volume. A major contributor to the desmoplastic reaction are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs actively interact with cancer cells and promote tumor progression by different mechanisms, including extracellular matrix deposition, remodeling, and secretion of tumor promoting factors, making CAFs an attractive target for PDA. However, emerging evidences indicate significant tumor-suppressive functions of CAFs, highlighting the complexity of CAF biology. CAFs were once considered as a uniform cell type within the cancer stroma. Recently, the existence of CAF heterogeneity in PDA has become appreciated. Due to advances in single cell technology, distinct subtypes of CAFs have been identified in PDA. Here we review recent updates in CAF biology in PDA, which may help develop effective CAF-targeted therapies in the future.					brekken, rolf/0000-0003-2704-2377; Huang, Huocong/0000-0002-6345-4566												0363-6143	1522-1563				AUG	2020	319	2					C233	C243		10.1152/ajpcell.00079.2020							WOS:000551052700001	32432930					
J	Dominijanni, A; Devarasetty, M; Soker, S				Dominijanni, Anthony; Devarasetty, Mahesh; Soker, Shay			Manipulating the Tumor Microenvironment in Tumor Organoids Induces Phenotypic Changes and Chemoresistance	ISCIENCE												Tumors comprised a tightly surrounded tumor microenvironment, made up of non-cellular extracellular matrix (ECM) and stromal cells. Although treatment response is often attributed to tumor heterogeneity, progression and malignancy are profoundly influenced by tumor cell interactions with the surrounding ECM. Here, we used a tumor organoid model, consisting of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) embedded in collagen type 1 (Col1) and colorectal cancer cell (HCT-116) spheroids, to determine the relationship between the ECM architecture, cancer cell malignancy, and chemoresistance. Exogenous transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) used to activate the HSCs increased the remodeling and bundling of Col1 in the ECM around the cancer spheroid. A dense ECM architecture inhibited tumor cell growth, reversed their mesenchymal phenotype, preserved stem cell population, and reduced chemotherapy response. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled biofabrication and manipulation of the ECM in tumor organoids results enables studying tumor cell-ECM interactions and better understand tumor cell response to chemotherapies.																		2589-0042				DEC 18	2020	23	12							101851	10.1016/j.isci.2020.101851							WOS:000600670000094	33319176

A comprehensive meta-analysis with heterogeneity analysis	MEDICINE												Background: The diagnostic and prognostic value of CD44v6 in patients with gastric cancer remains unclear. Therefore, a quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to determine the clinical value of CD44v6 in patients with gastric cancer. Methods: Sixteen studies with 2177 patients were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the impact of CD44v6 in patients with gastric cancer on clinicopathological features and 5year overall survival (OS). Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and regression analysis were introduced to evaluate the heterogeneity across the studies. Publication bias was also explored among the studies. Results: The meta-analysis showed that the upregulated CD44v6 was associated with lymph node metastasis (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.19-3.08; P = 0.007), distant metastasis (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.01-5.78; P = 0.000), high TNM stage (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.10-4.75; P = 0.026), lymphatic vessel invasion (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21-2.09; P = 0.001), and vascular invasion (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19-2.07; P = 0.001). When excluded 1 study based on sensitivity analysis, pooled HR indicated that CD44v6 positive expression was correlated poor 5-year OS (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.30-2.39; P = 0.000), meanwhile, heterogeneity was eliminated. The heterogeneity of Lauren type mainly existed in the big sample size subgroup. Different region and publication year might contribute to the heterogeneity of differentiation type. While the heterogeneity of lymph node mainly existed in Asian and big sample size group. Publication bias was observed among 12 studies on lymph node metastasis (P-publication bias = 0.041), and 5 studies on TNM stage (P-publication bias = 0.026). Conclusion: Taken together, CD44v6 overexpression might be correlated to the characteristics of tumor metastasis in gastric cancer, consisting with many mechanism studies. Therefore, CD44v6 might present a metastasis-associated biomarker in patients with gastric cancer.																	0025-7974	1536-5964				DEC	2016	95	50							e5603	10.1097/MD.0000000000005603							WOS:000391618400031	27977599

To date, no bona fide biomarkers that significantly translate into a survival benefit to glioblastoma patients have been identified. We previously reported that the IDH mutant G-CIMP-high subtype would be a predecessor to the G-CIMP-low subtype. Here, we performed a comprehensive DNA methylation longitudinal analysis of diffuse gliomas from 77 patients (200 tumors) to enlighten the epigenome-based malignant transformation of initially lower-grade gliomas. Intra-subtype heterogeneity among G-CIMP-high primary tumors allowed us to identify predictive biomarkers for assessing the risk of malignant recurrence at early stages of disease. G-CIMP-low recurrence appeared in 9.5% of all gliomas, and these resembled IDH-wild-type primary glioblastoma. G-CIMP-low recurrence can be characterized by distinct epigenetic changes at candidate functional tissue enhancers with AP-1/SOX binding elements, mesenchymal stem cell-like epigenomic phenotype, and genomic instability. Molecular abnormalities of longitudinal G-CIMP offer possibilities to defy glioblastoma progression.

J	Zhang, NH; Wang, Y; Zhang, JW; Guo, J; He, J				Zhang, Nihui; Wang, Yao; Zhang, Junwei; Guo, Jing; He, Jing			Controlled domain gels with a biomimetic gradient environment for osteochondral tissue regeneration	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												In order to repair an osteochondral defect, it is critical to advance a bi-lineage constructive scaffold with gradient transition. In this study, we developed a simple and straightforward approach for fabricating a multi-domain gel scaffold through the assembly/disassembly of low-molecular-weight gels (LMWGs) inside a stable PEGDA network by photopolymerization. The versatility of this technology enabled to vary biological, topological, and mechanical properties through material selection and to generate a chondrogenic-osteogenic gradient transition. The multi-domain gel exhibited an increasing stiffness gra-dient along the longitudinal direction from the cartilage layer at approximately 20 kPa to the bone layer at approximately 300 kPa as well as spatial variation at the gradient interface. Moreover, the transitional layer with a condensed structure and intermediate stiffness prevented delamination of the contrasting layers and maintained microenvironmental differences in the upper and lower layers. The in vitro results indicated that each domain had an individual capacity to spatially control the differentiation of MSCs toward osteoblastic lineage and chondrocytic lineage. This was mainly because the mechanical and to-pographical cues from the respective domains played an important role in modulating the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway, whereas the blockage of ROCK signals significantly impaired domain-modulated os-teogenesis and enhanced chondrogenesis. Additionally, the quantity and quality of osteochondral repair were evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks through histological analysis and micro-computed tomography (micro -CT). The results indicated that the multi-domain gels distinctly improved the regeneration of subchondral bone and cartilage tissues. Overall, the outcomes of this study can motivate future bioinspired gradient and heterogeneity strategies for osteochondral tissue regeneration. Statement of significance The regeneration of osteochondral defects remains a major challenge due to the complexity of osteo-chondral structure and the limited self-repair capacity of cartilage. The gradient design to mimic the transition between the calcified cartilage and the subchondral bone plate as well as the zones of car-tilage is an effective strategy. In this study, controlled multi-domain gels were fabricated through the assembly/disassembly of low-molecular-weight gels inside a stable PEGDA network by photopolymeriza-tion. The prepared multi-domain gels showed a chondrogenic-osteogenic gradient transition, which de-creased the possibility of delamination and stimulated osteochondral tissue regeneration in vivo . Overall, our study promotes new strategies of bioinspired gradients and heterogeneities for more challenging ap-plications. (c) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of Molecular Subtypes of Gastric Cancer With Different Responses to PI3-Kinase Inhibitors and 5-Fluorouracil	GASTROENTEROLOGY												BACKGROUND & AIMS: Almost all gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which have considerable heterogeneity among patients. We sought to identify subtypes of gastric adenocarcinomas with particular biological properties and responses to chemotherapy and targeted agents. METHODS: We compared gene expression patterns among 248 gastric tumors; using a robust method of unsupervised clustering, consensus hierarchical clustering with iterative feature selection, we identified 3 major subtypes. We developed a classifier for these subtypes and validated it in 70 tumors from a different population. We identified distinct genomic and epigenomic properties of the subtypes. We determined drug sensitivities of the subtypes in primary tumors using clinical survival data, and in cell lines through high-throughput drug screening. RESULTS: We identified 3 subtypes of gastric adenocarcinoma: proliferative, metabolic, and mesenchymal. Tumors of the proliferative subtype had high levels of genomic instability, TP53 mutations, and DNA hypomethylation. Cancer cells of the metabolic subtype were more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil than the other subtypes. Furthermore, in 2 independent groups of patients, those with tumors of the metabolic subtype appeared to have greater benefits with 5-fluorouracil treatment. Tumors of the mesenchymal subtype contain cells with features of cancer stem cells, and cell lines of this subtype are particularly sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mTOR inhibitors in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Based on gene expression patterns, we classified gastric cancers into 3 subtypes, and validated these in an independent set of tumors. The subgroups have differences in molecular and genetic features and response to therapy; this information might be used to select specific treatment approaches for patients with gastric cancer.

In this study, we explored the mechanism of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a crucial glycolytic enzyme, in maintaining cancer stemness and BCSCs plasticity, and promoting the interaction of BCSCs with tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Firstly, the expression of LDHA in breast cancer tissues was much higher than that in adjacent tissues and correlated with the clinical progression and prognosis of breast cancer patients based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set. Moreover, the orthotopic tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis were remarkable inhibited in mice inoculated with 4T1-shLdha cells. Secondly, the properties of cancer stemness were significantly suppressed in MDA-MB-231-shLDHA or A549-shLDHA cancer cells, including the decrease of ALDH(+) cells proportion, the repression of sphere formation and cellular migration, and the reduction of stemness genes (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) expression. However, the proportion of ALDH(+) cells (epithelial-like BCSCs, E-BCSCs) was increased and the proportion of CD44(+) CD24(-) cells (mesenchyme-like BCSCs, M-BCSCs) was decreased after LDHA silencing, suggesting a regulatory role of LDHA in E-BCSCs/M-BCSCs transformation in mouse breast cancer cells. Thirdly, the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, proved to interact with LDHA, was obviously increased in LDHA-silencing cancer cells. The recruitment of TAMs and the secretion of CCL2 were dramatically reduced after LDHA was knocked down in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, LDHA mediates a vicious cycle of mutual promotion between BCSCs plasticity and TAMs infiltration, which may provide an effective treatment strategy by targeting LDHA for breast cancer patients.																	2234-943X					JUN 10	2021	11								654452	10.3389/fonc.2021.654452							WOS:000664976300001	34178639

To avoid rejection of heterologous or xenogeneic cells, autologous cells are preferably used, that is, ovine mesenchymal stem cells (oMSC). Unlike human MSC, ovine MSC are not well studied regarding isolation, expansion, and characterization. Here we investigated the impact of culture media composition on growth characteristics, differentiation, and surface antigen expression of oMSC. The culture media varied in fetal calf serum (FCS) content and in the addition of supplements and/or additional epidermal growth factor (EGF). We found that FCS strongly influenced oMSC proliferation and that specific combinations of supplemental factors (MCDB-201, ITS-plus, dexamethasone, and L-ascorbic acid) determined the expression of surface epitopes. We compared two published protocols for oMSC differentiation towards the osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic fate and found (i) considerable donor to donor variations, (ii) protocol dependent variations, and (iii) variations resulting from the preculture medium composition. Our results indicate that the isolation and culture of oMSC in different growth media are highly variable regarding oMSC phenotype and behaviour. Furthermore, variations from donor to donor critically influence growth rate, surface marker expression, and differentiation.

Among the cellular heterogeneity of tumors, the existence of a small fraction of cells called cancer stem cells (CSC), thought to be responsible for the onset and propagation of cancer, has been demonstrated in some neoplasia. Although the existence of CSC has been reported for eRMS, their existence in aRMS, the most malignant subtype, has not been demonstrated to date. Given the lack of suitable markers to identify this subpopulation in aRMS, we used cancer stem cell-enriched supracellular structures (spheres and holoclones) to study this subpopulation. This strategy allowed us to demonstrate the capacity of both aRMS and eRMS cells to form these structures and retain self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, cells contained in spheres and holoclones showed significant Hedgehog pathway induction, the inhibition of which (pharmacologic or genetic) impairs the formation of both holoclones and spheres. Our findings point to a crucial role of this pathway in the maintenance of these structures and suggest that Hedgehog pathway targeting in CSC may have great potential in preventing local relapses and metastases.

Improved proteomic profiling of the cell surface of culture-expanded human bone marrow multipotent stromal cells	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS												A comprehensive analysis of the membrane proteome is essential to explain the biology of multipotent stromal cells and identify reliable protein biomarkers for the isolation as well as tracking of cells during differentiation and maturation. However, proteomic analysis of membrane proteins is challenging and they are noticeably under-represented in numerous proteomic studies. Here we introduce new approach, which includes high pressure-assisted membrane protein extraction, protein fractionation by gel-eluted liquid fraction entrapment electrophoresis (GELFREE), and combined use of liquid chromatography MALDI and ESI tandem mass spectrometry. This report presents the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of membrane proteome of undifferentiated and culture-expanded human bone marrow multipotent stromal cells (hBM-MSC) obtained from different human donors. Gene ontology mapping using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DAVID programs revealed the largest membrane proteomic dataset for hBM-MSC reported to date. Collectively, the new workflow enabled us to identify at least two-fold more membrane proteins compared to published results on hBM-MSC. A total of 84 CDs were identified including 14 CDs identified for the first time. This dataset can serve as a basis for further exploration of self-renewal, differentiation and characterization of hBM-MSC.

Elizabeth			Zebrafish MITF-Low Melanoma Subtype Models Reveal Transcriptional Subclusters and MITF-Independent Residual Disease	CANCER RESEARCH												The melanocyte-inducing transcription factor (MITF)-low melanoma transcriptional signature is predictive of poor outcomes for patients, but little is known about its biological significance, and animal models are lacking. Here, we used zebrafish genetic models with low activity of Mitfa (MITF-low) and established that the MITF-low state is causal of melanomaprogression and a predictor of melanoma biological subtype. MITF-low zebrafish melanomas resembled human MITF-low melanomas and were enriched for stem and invasive (mesenchymal) gene signatures. MITF-low activity coupled with a p53 mutation was sufficient to promote superficial growth melanomas, whereas BRAF(V600E) accelerated MITF-low melanoma onset and further promoted the development of MITF-high nodular growth-melanomas. Genetic inhibition of MITF activity led to rapid regression; recurrence occurred following reactivation of MITF. At the regression site, there was minimal residual disease that was resistant to loss of MITF activity (termed MITF-independent cells) with very low-to-no MITF activity or protein. Transcriptomic analysis of MITF-independent residual disease showed enrichment of mesenchymal and neural crest stem cell signatures similar to human therapy-resistant melanomas. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MITF-independent residual disease was heterogeneous depending on melanoma subtype. Further, there was a shared subpopulation of residual disease cells that was enriched for a neural crest G(0)-like state that preexisted in the primary tumor and remained present in recurring melanomas. These findings suggest that invasive and stem-like programs coupled with cellular heterogeneity contribute to poor outcomes for MITF-low melanoma patients and that MITF-independent subpopulations are an important therapeutic target to achieve long-term survival outcomes. Significance: This study provides a useful model for MITF-low melanomas and MITF-independent cell populations that can be used to study the mechanisms that drive these tumors as well as identify potential therapeutic options.

Reactivation of super-enhancers by KLF4 in human Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma	ONCOGENE												Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a disease of significant morbidity and mortality and rarely diagnosed in early stages. Despite extensive genetic and genomic characterization, targeted therapeutics and diagnostic markers of HNSCC are lacking due to the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of the disease. Herein, we have generated the global histone mark based epigenomic and transcriptomic cartogram of SCC25, a representative cell type of mesenchymal HNSCC and its normal oral keratinocyte counterpart. Examination of genomic regions marked by differential chromatin states and associated with misregulated gene expression led us to identify SCC25 enriched regulatory sequences and transcription factors (TF) motifs. These findings were further strengthened by ATAC-seq based open chromatin and TF footprint analysis which unearthed Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) as a potential key regulator of the SCC25 cistrome. We reaffirm the results obtained from in silico and chromatin studies in SCC25 by ChIP-seq of KLF4 and identify Delta Np63 as a co-oncogenic driver of the cancer-specific gene expression milieu. Taken together, our results lead us to propose a model where elevated KLF4 levels sustains the oncogenic state of HNSCC by reactivating repressed chromatin domains at key downstream genes, often by targeting super-enhancers.

We optimized a CTC isolation method that could capture their molecular heterogeneity and predict overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients receiving various chemotherapy regimens. We combined immunomagnetic enrichment of CD45-negative, EpCAM-positive circulating cancer cells with qRT-PCR amplification of CK20 and survivin expression in 88 mCRC patients and 20 healthy controls. We then evaluated the prognostic value of baseline CTC CK20 and survivin expression in mCRC patients. The presence of elevated CTC CK20 or survivin expression distinguished mCRC patients from controls with sufficient sensitivity (79.6%) and specificity (85%). In univariate analysis, patients with high CTC-CK20 expression (9 vs. 33.2+ months, log-rank P < 0.001) or high CTC-survivin expression (10 vs. 33.2+ months, log-rank P = 0.032) had a significantly worse median OS than those with low expression of either marker. In multivariable analysis, the high CTC-CK20 group had significantly shortened OS (HR, 3.11; adjusted P = 0.01), and there was a trend toward inferior OS in the high CTC-survivin group (HR, 1.76; adjusted P = 0.099). Patients with either high CTC CK20 or survivin expression had inferior OS compared with those with low expression of both markers (HR, 4.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-12.35; adjusted P = 0.005). Colorectal cancer CTCs can be reliably isolated using epithelial and stem cell markers. CTC CK20 and survivin expression may effectively predict OS in mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy.

The 3.6-kb promoter directed strong expression of GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) to bone and isolated tail tendon and lower expression in nonosseous tissues. The 2.3-kb promoter expressed the GFP mRNA in the bone and tail tendon with no detectable mRNA elsewhere. The pattern of fluorescence was evaluated in differentiating calvarial cell (mouse calvarial osteoblast cell [mCOB]) and in marrow stromal cell (MSC) cultures derived from the transgenic mice. The pOBCol3.6GFPtpz-positive cells first appeared in spindle-shaped cells before nodule formation and continued to show a strong signal in cells associated with bone nodules. pOBCol2.3GFPemd fluorescence first appeared in nodules undergoing mineralization. Histological analysis showed weaker pOBCol3.6GFPtpz-positive fibroblastic cells in the periosteal layer and strongly positive osteoblastic cells lining endosteal and trabecular surfaces. In contrast, a pOBCol2.3GFPemd signal was limited to osteoblasts; and osteocytes without detectable signal in periosteal fibroblasts. These findings suggest that Col1a1GFP transgenes are marking different subpopulations of cells during differentiation of skeletal osteoprogenitors. With the use of other promoters and color isomers of GFP, it should be possible to develop experimental protocols that can reflect the heterogeneity of cell differentiation in intact bone. In primary culture, this approach will afford isolation of subpopulations of these cells for molecular and cellular analysis.

BMSC represent the differentiated progeny of CFU-F, which however comprise a developmentally heterogeneous population as is reflected in the cellular heterogeneity of the cell populations to which they give rise. We have compared the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies recognising a series of stromal antigens, viz. STRO-1, HOP-26, CD49a and SB-10/CD166, as tools for the enrichment of CFU-F prior to culture and as developmental markers for culture-expanded BMSC. In freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC), the proportion of antigen-positive cells was 27%, 46%, 5% and 19% for STRO-1, HOP-26, CD49a and CD166, respectively. All CD49a(+) cells co-expressed STRO-1. The degree of CFU-F enrichment obtained with anti-CD49a (similar to18-fold) by a one-pass immunoselection strategy was significantly greater than that of all other antibodies tested. BMSC expressed higher levels of all antigens investigated (except for HOP-26) compared with BMMNC. Expression of STRO-1 and CD49a remained restricted to a subset of BMSC, whereas all BMSC were SB-10/CD166 positive. Treatment with dexamethasone (10 nM), which promotes the differentiation and further maturation of cells of the osteogenic lineage in this cell culture system, increased the expression of CD49a and HOP-26. The CD49a(+) and HOP-26(+) fractions of BMSC were further subdivided by dual-labelling with anti-STRO-1 and B4-78 (an antibody recognising the B/L/K isoform of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase), respectively. By using a variety of criteria, the HOP-26 antigen was identified as CD63, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins thought to modulate integrin compartmentalisation and signalling.

Therefore, it is essential to decipher pro/forward-differentiation mechanisms in cancer that may serve as therapeutic targets. We found that interfering with expression of the receptor for the lactogenic hormone prolactin (PRLR) in breast cancer cells representative of the luminal and epithelial breast cancer subtypes (hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2-enriched (HER2-E) resulted in loss of their differentiation state, enriched for stem-like cell subpopulations, and increased their tumorigenic capacity in a subtype-specific manner. Loss of PRLR expression in HR+ breast cancer cells caused their dedifferentiation generating a mesenchymal-basal-like phenotype enriched in CD44+ breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) showing high tumorigenic and metastatic capacities and resistance to anti-hormonal therapy. Whereas loss of PRLR expression in HER2-E breast cancer cells resulted in loss of their luminal differentiation yet enriched for epithelial ALDH+ BCSC population showing elevated HER2-driven tumorigenic, multi-organ metastatic spread, and resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Collectively, this study defines PRLR as a driver of precise luminal and epithelial differentiation limiting cellular plasticity, stemness, and tumorigenesis and emphasizing the function of pro/forward-differentiation pathways as a foundation for the discovery of anti-cancer therapeutic targets.																	2157-9024					JAN 14	2021	10	1							10	10.1038/s41389-020-00297-5							WOS:000610668000001	33446633

Snail depletes the tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma	ONCOGENE												Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by high heterogeneity and invasiveness. It is increasingly accepted that the refractory feature of GBM to current therapies stems from the existence of few tumorigenic cells that sustain tumor growth and spreading, the so-called glioma-initiating cells (GICs). Previous studies showed that cytokines of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family induce differentiation of the GICs, and thus act as tumor suppressors. Molecular pathways that explain this behavior of BMP cytokines remain largely elusive. Here, we show that BMP signaling induces Smad-dependent expression of the transcriptional regulator Snail in a rapid and sustained manner. Consistent with its already established promigratory function in other cell types, we report that Snail silencing decreases GBM cell migration. Consequently, overexpression of Snail increases GBM invasiveness in a mouse xenograft model. Surprisingly, we found that Snail depletes the GBM capacity to form gliomaspheres in vitro and to grow tumors in vivo, both of which are important features shared by GICs. Thus Snail, acting downstream of BMP signaling, dissociates the invasive capacity of GBM cells from their tumorigenic potential.

Within the tumor microenvironment, diverse cells are actively interacting with their surroundings via EVs facilitating tumor malignancy by regulating malignant cascades including angiogenesis, immune modulation, and metastasis. This review summarizes the recent studies of fundamental understandings of EVs from the aspect of EV heterogeneity and highlights the role of EVs in the various steps from oncogenic to metastatic processes. The recognition of EV subtypes is necessary to identify which pathways can be affected by EVs and which subtypes can be targeted in therapeutic approaches or liquid biopsies.																	1044-579X	1096-3650				SEP	2021	74				SI		79	91		10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.03.032							WOS:000703440300006	33798721

Here, the transcriptomic landscape of 108 108 IVD cells was mapped using single-cell RNA sequencing of three main compartments from young and adult healthy IVDs, including the nucleus pulposus (NP), annulus fibrosus, and cartilage endplate (CEP). The chondrocyte subclusters were classified based on their potential regulatory, homeostatic, and effector functions in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Notably, in the NP, a PROCR+ resident progenitor population showed enriched colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) activity and trilineage differentiation capacity. Finally, intercellular crosstalk based on signaling network analysis uncovered that the PDGF and TGF-beta cascades are important cues in the NP microenvironment. In conclusion, a single-cell transcriptomic atlas that resolves spatially regulated cellular heterogeneity together with the critical signaling that underlies homeostasis will help to establish new therapeutic strategies for IVD degeneration in the clinic.				huang, dezhi/ABC-6566-2021	he, jian/0000-0002-8632-4924												2095-4700	2095-6231				AUG 16	2021	9	1							37	10.1038/s41413-021-00163-z							WOS:000686670500001	34400611

Inverse expression states of the BRN2 and MITF transcription factors in melanoma spheres and tumour xenografts regulate the NOTCH pathway	ONCOGENE												The use of adherent monolayer cultures have produced many insights into melanoma cell growth and differentiation, but often novel therapeutics demonstrated to act on these cells are not active in vivo. It is imperative that new methods of growing melanoma cells that reflect growth in vivo are investigated. To this end, a range of human melanoma cell lines passaged as adherent cultures or induced to form melanoma spheres (melanospheres) in stem cell media have been studied to compare cellular characteristics and protein expression. Melanoma spheres and tumours grown from cell lines as mouse xenografts had increased heterogeneity when compared with adherent cells and 3D-spheroids in agar (aggregates). Furthermore, cells within the melanoma spheres and mouse xenografts each displayed a high level of reciprocal BRN2 or MITF expression, which matched more closely the pattern seen in human melanoma tumours in situ, rather than the propensity for co-expression of these important melanocytic transcription factors seen in adherent cells and 3D-spheroids. Notably, when the levels of the BRN2 and MITF proteins were each independently repressed using siRNA treatment of adherent melanoma cells, members of the NOTCH pathway responded by decreasing or increasing expression, respectively. This links BRN2 as an activator, and conversely, MITF as a repressor of the NOTCH pathway in melanoma cells. Loss of the BRN2-MITF axis in antisense-ablated cell lines decreased the melanoma sphere-forming capability, cell adhesion during 3D-spheroid formation and invasion through a collagen matrix. Combined, this evidence suggests that the melanoma sphere-culture system induces subpopulations of cells that may more accurately portray the in vivo disease, than the growth as adherent melanoma cells.

NEPHRON EXPERIMENTAL NEPHROLOGY												Background: The most common intrarenal cause for acute kidney injury/renal failure is tubular damage. The kidney tubules are arranged as compartments of cellular mosaics to perform their functions, and at rest almost a fifth of the human ATP consumption is allotted to the reabsorption of substances from the filtrate, rendering especially the proximal tubules highly sensitive to oxygen and/or nutrient deprivation. Normally mitotically quiescent, the tubular epithelium shows a brisk regenerative response following injury if supportive care is offered, allowing functional restoration. Despite this, the cellular machinery behind the regenerative capacity is still not unequivocally defined. This is at odds with other epithelia such as those of the skin and intestine, where stem cells maintain a continuous flow of new cells from designated niches. Summary: This review discusses the classical concept of renal regeneration, i.e. stochastically surviving cells undergoing dedifferentiation (or epithelial-mesenchymal transition) followed by replenishment of the tubular epithelium. Furthermore however, this view has recently been challenged by the concept of organ-confined stem/progenitor cells, bone marrow-derived stem cells, or mesenchynnal stem cells taking part in the regenerative events. Whereas results from animal models support the classical view, morphologically distinct cells have been demonstrated in human kidneys, requiring interpretation. This review presents some of the previous work and techniques and highlights issues that need to be reconciled. Key Messages: In adult humans, the kidney tubules contain scattered cells with a distinct set of markers and properties, such as increased robustness during tubular damage. These cells may be induced by injury or represent a resident progenitor cell pool. To date, animal studies using lineage-tracing methods argue for an inductive scenario. In humans, the situation is less clear and one might speculate that the cellular heterogeneity might reflect elements of cellular reprogramming to a progenitor-like state, perhaps by induction. Due to intense investigational efforts, however, a scientific consensus may soon be reached, which will benefit further research. (C) 2014 S.

This resistance to treatment is mainly due to high heterogeneity and plasticity of melanoma cells strictly connected to changes in tumor microenvironment Hypoxia can drastically alter cancer biology. Solid tumor cells under hypoxia gain stem-like features, they are more invasive and drug-resistant than their normoxic counterparts. These effects could be mediated by changes in miRNA expression under hypoxia. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that can negatively control gene expression. In the present study using microarray technology we evaluated the expression of miRNAs in melanoma cells derived from nodular melanoma and grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Using R environment for statistical analysis we found that 70 miRNAs were differentially-expressed, and 16 of them were significantly down-regulated in melanoma cells grown in hypoxic conditions compared to cells grown in normoxia. We intended to find transcripts whose expression is increased due to down-regulation of selected miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that increased levels of HIF-2 alpha, ABCB5, OCT4, SOX2 and ZEB1 in different melanoma populations under hypoxia could be a result of significant down-regulation of miR-340-5p. Inhibition of miR-340-5p confirmed that this miRNA negatively influences the expression of ABCB5. This is the first study showing the relationship between miR-340-5p and expression of ABCB5, a transmembrane transporter involved in drug resistance considered as a marker of melanoma stem-like cells.

Phenotypic and molecular characterization of the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH												Introduction: In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like and claudin-low), each of which has unique biologic and prognostic features. Here, we comprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin-low tumor subtype. Methods: The clinical, pathological and biological features of claudin-low tumors were compared to the other tumor subtypes using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data sets. These main features of claudin-low tumors were also evaluated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models. Results: Claudin-low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers, high enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes and cancer stem cell-like features. Clinically, the majority of claudin-low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple negative) invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation. They also have a response rate to standard preoperative chemotherapy that is intermediate between that of basal-like and luminal tumors. Interestingly, we show that a group of highly utilized breast cancer cell lines, and several genetically engineered mouse models, express the claudin-low phenotype. Finally, we confirm that a prognostically relevant differentiation hierarchy exists across all breast cancers in which the claudin-low subtype most closely resembles the mammary epithelial stem cell. Conclusions: These results should help to improve our understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of breast cancer and provide tools for the further evaluation of the unique biology of claudin-low tumors and cell lines.

Vitamin D regulation of HAS2, hyaluronan synthesis and metabolism in triple negative breast cancer cells	JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its ligand 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 (1,25D) exert anti-tumor effects, but considerable heterogeneity has been reported in different model systems. In general, cell lines derived from aggressive tumor subtypes such as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) express low levels of VDR and are less sensitive to 1,25D than those derived from more differentiated tumor types. We have previously reported that 1,25D inhibits hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (HAS2) expression and hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis in murine TNBC cells. Here we confirmed the inhibitory effect of 1,25D on HA synthesis in human Hs578T cells representative of the mesenchymal/stem-like (MSL) subtype of TNBC. Because HA synthesis requires the production of hexoses for incorporation into HA, we predicted that the high HA production characteristic of Hs578T cells would require sustained metabolic changes through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). We thus examined metabolic gene expression in Hs578T cell variants sorted for High (HA(High)) and Low (HA(Low)) HA production, and the ability of 1,25D to reverse these adaptive changes. HA(High) populations exhibited elevated HA production, smaller size, increased proliferation and higher motility than HA(Low) populations. Despite their more aggressive phenotype, HA(High) populations retained expression of VDR protein at levels comparable to that of parental Hs578T cells and HA(Low) subclones. Treatment with 1,25D decreased production of HA in both HA(High) and HA(Low) populations. We also found that multiple metabolic enzymes were aberrantly expressed in HA(High) cells, especially those involved in glutamine and glucose metabolism. Notably, Glutaminase (GLS), a known oncogene for breast cancer, was strongly upregulated in HA(High) vs. HA(Low) cells and its expression was significantly reduced by 1,25D (100 nM, 24 h). Consistent with this finding, Seahorse extracellular flux analysis indicated that respiration in HA(High) cells was significantly more dependent on exogenous glutamine than HA(Low) cells, however, acute 1,25D exposure did not alter metabolic flux. In contrast to GLS, the glutamate transporter SLC1A7 was significantly reduced in HA(High) cells compared to HA(Low) cells and its expression was enhanced by 1,25D. These findings support the concept that 1,25D can reverse the metabolic gene expression changes associated with HA production in cancer cells with aggressive phenotypes.																	0960-0760					JUL	2020	201								105688	10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105688							WOS:000539443800012	32360595

We aimed at investigating the inhibitory effects of Sulindac and vitamin D3 (VD) on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were cultured with different concentrations of Sulindac and VD over a period of 24, 48 and 72 hours for cell viability and IC50 experiments. Hochst staining was used to evaluate apoptosis, whereas quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to measure mRNA levels of BCL-2 and BAX genes. Immunofluorescence staining was used to monitor intracellular beta-catenin expression. The protein levels of AKT, AMPK and P65 were measured by western blotting. The result showed that cell viability decreased in treated cells dose/time dependently (P < .05). Hochst staining showed an increase in fragmented nuclei in treated cells. The expression of BCL-2 and BAX genes decreased and increased in treated cells, respectively (P < .05). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of beta-catenin significantly reduced in treated cells. The AKT-1/p-Akt-1 and AMPK/p-AMPK ratio increased in treated cells (P < .05), but the P65/p-P65 ratio did not change significantly (P > .05). Our results indicated that the combination of Sulindac and VD has a growth-inhibiting effect on MCF-7 cells through AMPK/Akt/beta-catenin axis.

Progenitor cells from different zones of human cartilage and their correlation with histopathological osteoarthritis progression	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH												Cell-based therapies development for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) requires an understanding of the disease progression and attributes of the cells resident in cartilage. This study focused on quantitative assessment of the concentration and biological potential of stem and progenitor cells resident in different zones of cartilage displaying macroscopic Outerbridge grade 1-2 OA, and their correlation with OA progression based on established histologic scoring system. Lateral femoral condyles were collected from 15 patients with idiopathic OA and varus knees undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Superficial(C-sp, top approximate to 500 mu m) and deep cartilage(C-dp) was separated. Chondrogenic Connective Tissue Progenitors (CTP-C) were assayed by standardized Colony-Forming-Unit assay using automated image analysis (Colonyze(TM)) based on ASTM standard F-2944-12. Cell concentration (cells/mg) was significantly greater in C-sp (median: 7,000; range: 3,440-17,600) than C-dp (median: 5,340; range: 3,393-9,660), p=0.039. Prevalence (CTPs/million cells) was not different between C-sp (median: 1,274; range: 0-3,898) and C-dp (median:1,365; range:0-6,330), p=0.42. In vitro performance of CTP-C progeny varied widely within and between patients, manifest by variation in colony size and morphology. Mean histopathological Mankin score was 4.7 (SD=1.2), representing mild to moderate OA. Tidemark breach by blood vessels was associated with lower C-sp cell concentration (p=0.02). Matrix degradation was associated with lower C-dp cell and CTP-C concentration (p=0.015 and p=0.095, respectively), independent of articular surface changes. These findings suggest that the initiation of OA may occur in either superficial or deep zones. The pathological changes affect CTP-Cs in C-sp and C-dp cartilage zones differently. The heterogeneity among the available CTP-Cs in C-sp and C-dp suggests performance-based selection to optimize cell-sourcing strategies for therapy. (c) 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Impaired coordination between signaling pathways is revealed in human colorectal cancer using single-cell mass cytometry of archival tissue blocks	SCIENCE SIGNALING												Cellular heterogeneity poses a substantial challenge to understanding tissue-level phenotypes and confounds conventional bulk analyses. To analyze signaling at the single-cell level in human tissues, we applied mass cytometry using cytometry time of flight to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal and diseased intestinal specimens. This technique, called FFPE-DISSECT (disaggregation for intracellular signaling in single epithelial cells from tissue), is a single-cell approach to characterizing signaling states in embedded tissue samples. We applied FFPE-DISSECT coupled to mass cytometry and found differential signaling by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in intestinal enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells, implicating the downstream RAS-RAF-MEK pathway in determining goblet cell identity. Application of this technique and computational analyses to human colon specimens confirmed the reduced differentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to normal colon and revealed increased intratissue and intertissue heterogeneity in CRC with quantitative changes in the regulation of signaling pathways. Specifically, coregulation of the kinases p38 and ERK, the translation regulator 4EBP1, and the transcription factor CREB in proliferating normal colon cells was lost in CRC. Our data suggest that this single-cell approach, applied in conjunction with genomic annotation, enables the rapid and detailed characterization of cellular heterogeneity from clinical repositories of embedded human tissues. This technique can be used to derive cellular landscapes from archived patient samples (beyond CRC) and as a high-resolution tool for disease characterization and subtyping.

Primary Cells Isolated from Human Knee Cartilage Reveal Decreased Prevalence of Progenitor Cells but Comparable Biological Potential During Osteoarthritic Disease Progression	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME												Background: Current decisions on cellular therapies for osteoarthritis are based primarily on clinical experience or on assumptions about preferred cell sourcing. They have not been informed by rigorous standardized measurements of the chondrogenic connective-tissue progenitors (CTP-Cs) or their intrinsic diversity of chondrogenic potential. The goal of this study was to quantitatively define the CTP-Cs resident in cartilage of different grades of osteoarthritis and to compare their concentration, prevalence, and biological potential. Methods: Twenty-three patients who had varus malalignment of the knee and were scheduled to undergo elective total knee arthroplasty for idiopathic osteoarthritis and who had grade 1-2 osteoarthritis on the lateral femoral condyle and grade 3-4 osteoarthritis on the medial femoral condyle were recruited for study of the cartilage removed during surgery. CTP-Cs were assayed by a standardized colony-forming-unit assay using automated image-analysis software based on ASTM standard test method F2944-12. Results: Cell concentration was significantly greater (p < 0.001) in grade 3-4 cartilage than in grade 1-2 cartilage. The prevalence of CTP-Cs varied widely, but it trended lower in grade 3-4 cartilage than in grade 1-2 samples (p = 0.078). The biological performance of CTP-Cs from grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 cartilage was comparable. Increased cell concentration was a significant predictor of decreased CTP-C prevalence (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Although grade 3-4 cartilage showed fewer CTP-Cs than grade 1-2 cartilage, the range of biological performance was comparable, which suggests that either may be used as a source for potent CTP-Cs. However, the biological reason for the heterogeneity of CTP-Cs in cartilage and the biological implications of that heterogeneity are not well understood and require further study.

Enhanced nutrient transport improves the depth-dependent properties of tri-layered engineered cartilage constructs with zonal co-culture of chondrocytes and MSCs	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												Biomimetic design in cartilage tissue engineering is a challenge given the complexity of the native tissue. While numerous studies have generated constructs with near-native bulk properties, recapitulating the depth-dependent features of native tissue remains a challenge. Furthermore, limitations in nutrient transport and matrix accumulation in engineered constructs hinders maturation within the central core of large constructs. To overcome these limitations, we fabricated tri-layered constructs that recapitulate the depth-dependent cellular organization and functional properties of native tissue using zonally derived chondrocytes co-cultured with MSCs. We also introduced porous hollow fibers (HFs) and HFs/cotton threads to enhance nutrient transport. Our results showed that tri-layered constructs with depth-dependent organization and properties could be fabricated. The addition of HFs or HFs/threads improved matrix accumulation in the central core region. With HF/threads, the local modulus in the deep region of tri-layered constructs nearly matched that of native tissue, though the properties in the central regions remained lower. These constructs reproduced the zonal organization and depth-dependent properties of native tissue, and demonstrate that a layer-by-layer fabrication scheme holds promise for the biomimetic repair of focal cartilage defects. Statement of significance Articular cartilage is a highly organized tissue driven by zonal heterogeneity of cells, extracellular matrix proteins and fibril orientations, resulting in depth-dependent mechanical properties. Therefore, the recapitulation of the functional properties of native cartilage in a tissue engineered construct requires such a biomimetic design of the morphological organization, and this has remained a challenge in cartilage tissue engineering. This study demonstrates that a layer-by-layer fabrication scheme, including co-cultures of zone-specific articular CHs and MSCs, can reproduce the depth-dependent characteristics and mechanical properties of native cartilage while minimizing the need for large numbers of chondrocytes. In addition, introduction of a porous hollow fiber (combined with a cotton thread) enhanced nutrient transport and depth-dependent properties of the tri-layered construct. Such a tri-layered construct may provide critical advantages for focal cartilage repair. These constructs hold promise for restoring native tissue structure and function, and may be beneficial in terms of zone-to-zone integration with adjacent host tissue and providing more appropriate strain transfer after implantation.

Chordoma patients have a long life expectancy with high mortality from the disease. Cancer stem cells, which are known to exist in chordomas, have extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential and are responsible for maintaining tumor heterogeneity along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has multiple functions in stem cell biology, the immune response, and cancer, and is potentially a key molecule that allows cancer stem cells to self-renew. The purpose of this study was to determine whether LT increases the aggressive traits of chordoma cells and leads to a poor prognosis in patients. Chordoma cell lines were treated with LIF, and functional tests were done. Twenty skull base chordoma samples were checked for levels of LT and a correlation with clinicopathological features. The whole transcriptome microarray was used to observe changes in gene expression. We observed increased migration, invasion, tumorosphere formation, colony formation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance accompanied by a dramatic elevation in inflammatory gene networks and pathways in chordomas. The expression of LIF was associated with tumor size and a poorer overall survival. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assessments suggest that LIP can facilitate tumor-promoting inflammation. Results indicate that LT plays a role in maintaining cancer stem cells in chordomas.

The spatial distribution of the different bone and BM cell types remains elusive, owing to technical challenges associated with bone imaging. To map nonhematopoietic cells and structures in bone and BM, we performed multicolor 3D imaging of osteoblastic, vascular, perivascular, neuronal and marrow stromal cells, and extracellular-matrix proteins in whole mouse femurs. We analyzed potential interactions between cells and molecules on the basis of colocalization of markers. Our results shed light on the markers expressed by different osteolineage cell types; the heterogeneity of vascular and perivascular cells; the neural subtypes innervating marrow and bone; the diversity of stromal cells; and the distribution of extracellular-matrix components. Our complete imaging data set is available for download and can be used in research in bone biology, hematology, vascular biology, neuroscience and extracellular-matrix biology.

However, data on the internal heterogeneity of applied cell populations at different O-2 levels and possible impacts on differentiation potentials are controversial. Here, the expression of 39 human HOX genes was determined in neonatal cord blood stromal cells and linked to differentiation-associated signatures. In cord blood, unrestricted somatic stromal cells (USSCs), lacking HOX gene expression, and cord blood-derived multipotent stromal cells (CB-MSCs), expressing about 20 HOX genes, are distinguished by their specific HOX code. Interestingly, 74% of the clones generated at 21% O-2 were HOX-negative USSCs, whereas 73% of upcoming clones at 3% O-2 were HOX-positive CB-MSCs. In order to better categorize distinct cell lines generated at 3% O-2, the expression of all 39 HOX genes within HOX clusters A, B, C and D were tested and new subtypes defined: cells negative in all four HOX clusters (USSCs); cells positive in all four clusters (CB-MSCsABCD); and subpopulations missing a single cluster (CB-MSCsACD and CB-MSCsBCD). Comprehensive qPCR analyses of established chondro-osteomarkers revealed subtype-specific signatures verifiably associated with in vitro and in vivo differentiation capacity. The data presented here underline the necessity of better characterizing distinct cell populations at a clonal level, taking advantage of the inherent specific HOX code as a distinguishing feature between individual subtypes. Moreover, the correlation of subtype-specific molecular signatures with in vitro and in vivo bone formation is discussed. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Kidney injuries provoke a high request of organ transplants making it the most demanding system in the field of regenerative medicine. Furthermore, renal cancer frequently threaten patients' life and aggressive forms still remain difficult to treat. Ethical issues related to the use of embryonic stem cells, has fueled research on adult, patient-specific pluripotent stem cells as a model for discovery and therapeutic development, but to date, normal and cancerous renal experimental models are lacking. Several research groups are focusing on the development of organoid cultures. Since organoids mimic the original tissue architecture in vitro, they represent an excellent model for tissue engineering studies and cancer therapy testing. We established normal and tumor renal cell carcinoma organoids previously maintained in a heterogeneous multi-clone stem cell-like enriching medium. Starting from adult normal kidney specimens, we were able to isolate and propagate organoid 3D-structures composed of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells while expressing nephron specific markers. Furthermore, we were capable to establish organoids derived from cancer tissues although with a success rate inferior to that of their normal counterpart. Cancer cultures displayed epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype while retaining tumor specific markers. Of note, tumor organoids recapitulated neoplastic masses when orthotopically injected into immunocompromised mice. Our data suggest an innovative approach of long-term establishment of normal- and cancer-derived renal organoids obtained from cultures of fleshly dissociated adult tissues. Our results pave the way to organ replacement pioneering strategies as well as to new models for studying drug-induced nephrotoxicity and renal diseases. Along similar lines, deriving organoids from renal cancer patients opens unprecedented opportunities for generation of preclinical models aimed at improving therapeutic treatments.

However, their pooled effects for dopaminergic neuron have yet to be described. Objective: To review the neuroprotective effect of naive BMSCs in rodent models of PD. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria according to PICOS criteria were as follows: (1) population: rodents; (2) intervention: unmodified BMSCs; (3) comparison: not specified; (4) primary outcome: tyrosine hydroxylase level in the substantia nigra pars compacta and rotational behavior; secondary outcome: rotarod test, and limb function; (5) study: experimental studies. Multiple prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis were conducted. Following quality assessment, random effects models were used for this meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-seven animal studies were included. The median quality score was 4.7 (interquartile range, 2-8). Overall standardized mean difference between animals treated with naive BMSCs and controls was 2.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.70, 3.87; P < 0.001) for densitometry of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive staining; -1.54 (95% confidence interval: -2.11, -0.98; P < 0.001) for rotational behavior. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that naive BMSCs therapy increased dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated behavioral deficits in rodent models of PD.																	1663-4365					DEC 11	2020	12								539933	10.3389/fnagi.2020.539933							WOS:000601599100001	33362527

Here, we show that differential usage of the genomic repertoire of transcriptional enhancers leads to grade-specific gene expression programs in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating gene expression profiling, epigenomic footprinting, and loss-of-function experiments in PDAC cell lines of different grade, we identified the repertoires of enhancers specific to high-and low-grade PDACs and the cognate set of transcription factors acting to maintain their activity. Among the candidate regulators of PDAC differentiation, KLF5 was selectively expressed in pre-neoplastic lesions and low-grade primary PDACs and cell lines, where it maintained the acetylation of grade-specific enhancers, the expression of epithelial genes such as keratins and mucins, and the ability to organize glandular epithelia in xenografts. The identification of the transcription factors controlling differentiation in PDACs will help clarify the molecular bases of its heterogeneity and progression.

Blocking immune checkpoint pathways is a promising approach to improve anti-tumor immunity, but the clinical efficacies are still limited. We previously identified follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) as a determinant of immune dysfunction mediated by mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and immunoregulatory cells. Here, we demonstrate that blocking FSTL1 but not immune checkpoint pathways significantly suppresses cancer progression and metastasis in several mouse tumor models with increased MSCs. Expression of DIP2A (the receptor of FSTL1) in tumor cells is critical for FSTL1 -induced immunoresistance. FSTL1/DIP2A co-positivity in tumor tissues correlates with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. Thus, breaking the FSTL1 -DIP2A axis may be a useful strategy for successfully inducing anti-tumor immunity.																	2211-1247					AUG 14	2018	24	7					1790	1801		10.1016/j.celrep.2018.07.043							WOS:000441581000013	30110636

Detailed understanding of the ontogenetic, cellular and molecular characteristics of functional intervertebral disc (IVD) cell populations is pivotal to the successful development of cell replacement therapies and IVD regeneration. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether phenotypically distinct clonal cell lines representing different subpopulations in the human NP could be generated using immortalization strategies. Methods: Nondegenerate healthy disc material (age range, 8 to 15 years) was obtained as surplus surgical material. Early passage NP monolayer cell cultures were initially characterized using a recently established NP marker set. NP cells were immortalized by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LTag) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression. Immortalized cells were clonally expanded and characterized based on collagen type I, collagen type II, alpha 1 (COL2A1), and SRY-box 9 (SOX9) protein expression profiles, as well as on expression of a subset of established in vivo NP cell lineage markers. Results: A total of 54 immortal clones were generated. Profiling of a set of novel NP markers (CD24, CA12, PAX1, PTN, FOXF1 and KRT19 mRNA) in a representative set of subclones substantiated successful immortalization of multiple cellular subpopulations from primary isolates and confirmed their NP origin and/or phenotype. We were able to identify two predominant clonal NP subtypes based on their morphological characteristics and their ability to induce SOX9 and COL2A1 under conventional differentiation conditions. In addition, cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)-negative NP responder clones formed spheroid structures in various culture systems, suggesting the preservation of a more immature phenotype compared to CD24-positive nonresponder clones. Conclusions: Here we report the generation of clonal NP cell lines from nondegenerate human IVD tissue and present a detailed characterization of NP cellular subpopulations. Differential cell surface marker expression and divergent responses to differentiation conditions suggest that the NP subtypes may correspond to distinct maturation stages and represent distinct NP cell subpopulations. Hence, we provide evidence that the immortalization strategy that we applied is capable of detecting cell heterogeneity in the NP. Our cell lines yield novel insights into NP biology and provide promising new tools for studies of IVD development, cell function and disease.

The bone marrow cytokine network is therefore important, and the mediator release profile seems more important than single mediators. It is not known whether the characterization of primary AML cell proteomes reflects the heterogeneity of the broad and dynamic constitutive mediator release profile by these cells. To address this, we compared the intracellular levels of 41 proteins in 19 AML patients with the constitutive extracellular release during in vitro culture, including chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and protease regulators. The constitutive release of most mediators showed a wide variation (up to 2000-fold differences) between patients. Detectable intracellular levels were seen for 10 of 41 mediators, but for most of these 10 mediators we could not detect significant correlations between the constitutive release during in vitro culture and their intracellular levels. Intracellular protein levels in primary human AML cells do not reflect the dynamics, capacity, and variation between patients in constitutive mediator release profiles. Measurements of these profiles thus add complementary information to proteomic detection/quantification regarding the heterogeneity of the AML cell contributions to the bone marrow cytokine network.

Evaluation of deacetylase inhibition in metaplastic breast carcinoma using multiple derivations of preclinical models of a new patient-derived tumor	PLOS ONE												Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a clinically aggressive and rare subtype of breast cancer, with similar features to basal-like breast cancers. Due to rapid growth rates and characteristic heterogeneity, MBC is often unresponsive to standard chemotherapies; and novel targeted therapeutic discovery is urgently needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (DACi) suppress tumor growth and metastasis through regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition axis in various cancers, including basal-like breast cancers. We utilized a new MBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) to examine the effect of DACi therapy on MBC. Cell morphology, cell cycle-associated gene expressions, transwell migration, and metastasis were evaluated in patient-derived cells and tumors after treatment with romidepsin and panobinostat. Derivations of our PDX model, including cells, spheres, organoids, explants, andin vivoimplanted tumors were treated. Finally, we tested the effects of combining DACi with approved chemotherapeutics on relative cell biomass. DACi significantly suppressed the total number of lung metastasisin vivousing our PDX model, suggesting a role for DACi in preventing circulating tumor cells from seeding distal tissue sites. These data were supported by our findings that DACi reduced cell migration, populations, and expression of mesenchymal-associated genes. While DACi treatment did affect cell cycle-regulating genesin vitro, tumor growth was not affected compared to controls. Importantly, gene expression results varied depending on the cellular or tumor system used, emphasizing the importance of using multiple derivations of cancer models in preclinical therapeutic discovery research. Furthermore, DACi sensitized and produced a synergistic effect with approved oncology therapeutics on inherently resistant MBC. This study introduced a role for DACi in suppressing the migratory and mesenchymal phenotype of MBC cells through regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition axis and suppression of the CTC population. Preliminary evidence that DACi treatment in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors exerts a synergistic effect on MBC cells was also demonstrated.				; Del Valle, Luis/J-4085-2015	Chang, Tiffany/0000-0002-0468-7546; Sabol, Rachel/0000-0002-0280-8818; Del Valle, Luis/0000-0003-3894-9206												1932-6203					OCT 9	2020	15	10							e0226464	10.1371/journal.pone.0226464							WOS:000581817500042	33035223

The goal of our study was to assess the prognostic significance of these markers in patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 347 ovarian cancers were used to construct a microarray. Immunohistochemical studies for ALDH1A1, CD133, CD44, and CD24 were performed and scored semiquantitatively by 2 pathologists based on intensity and percent of positive immunoreactive cells. Immunohistochemistry was compared to clinical parameters and survival. Of the 347 cases, early stage disease, nonserous tumors, cases with incomplete therapy, and cores with no tumor were excluded. Immunohistochemistry was interpretable in 124 of the 136 stage III and IV ovarian serous carcinoma. ALDHIAI, CD24, and CD44 were variably detected in both tumor and stromal cells, and immunoreactivity in tumor was stronger than in stromal cells. CD133 immunoreactivity was not quantified due to nonspecific staining in tumor and stroma. Statistical analyses using chi(2) and Student t test revealed that ALDHIA1-positive (n = 53) carcinoma were 3 times more likely to demonstrate platinum refractoriness than ALDHIA1-negative (n = 71) tumors (17% vs. 6%, respectively; p = .04); however, neither progression free nor overall survival was influenced by ALDH1A1 status in this cohort. The expression of CD44 and CD24 had no clinicopathological associations in the present study. Our study supports that ALDH1A1 expression is associated with poor response to platinum-based therapy in patients with high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. Further study of this relationship is needed to understand how this could impact clinical care. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The cellular origin of fibroblasts within the stroma has not been determined. Here, we show that the Gli1 and Hoxb6 markers label distinct fibroblast pop-ulations in the healthy mouse pancreas. We then set out to determine whether these distinct fibroblast populations expanded during carcinogenesis. METHODS: We developed genetically engineered models using a dual-recombinase approach that allowed us to induce pancreatic cancer formation through codon-optimized Flp recombinase-driven epithelial recombination of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog while labeling Gli1(+) or Hoxb6+ fibroblasts in an inducible manner. By using these models, we lineage-traced these 2 fibroblast populations during the process of carcinogenesis. RESULTS: Although in the healthy pancreas Gli1(+) fibroblasts and Hoxb6(+) fibroblasts are present in similar numbers, they contribute differently to the stroma in carcinogenesis. Namely, Gli1(+) fibro-blasts expand dramatically, whereas Hoxb6(+) cells do not. CONCLUSIONS: Fibroblasts present in the healthy pancreas expand during carcinogenesis, but with a different prevalence for different subtypes. Here, we compared Gli1(+) and Hoxb6(+) fibroblasts and found only Gli1(+) expanded to contribute to the stroma during pancreatic carcinogenesis.

It is characterized with anatomic and histologic variations along with diagnostic or prognostic difficulties. OS comprises genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cells. Bone microenvironment elements are proved to account for tumor heterogeneity and disease progression. Bone extracellular matrix (BEM) retains the microstructural matrices and biochemical components of native extracellular matrix. This tissue-specific niche provides a favorable and long-term scaffold for OS cell seeding and proliferation. This article provides a protocol for the preparation of BEM model and its further experimental application. OS cells can grow and differentiate into multiple phenotypes consistent with the histopathological complexity of OS clinical specimens. The model also allows visualization of diverse morphologies and their association with genetic alterations and underlying regulatory mechanisms. As homologous to human OS, this BEM-OS model can be developed and applied to the pathology and clinical research of OS.																	1940-087X					APR	2019		146							e59271	10.3791/59271							WOS:000466500600060	31033963

Herein, we aimed to characterize the molecular features of PCa by clustering the miRNA-regulated transcriptome with non-negative matrix factorization. Using 478 PCa samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, four molecular subtypes (S-I, S-II, S-III, and S-IV) were identified and validated in two merged microarray and RNAseq datasets with 656 and 252 samples, respectively. Interestingly, the four subtypes showed distinct clinical and biological features after comprehensive analyses of clinical features, multiomic profiles, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. S-I is basal/stem/mesenchymal-like and immune-excluded with marked transforming growth factor beta, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and hypoxia signals, increased sensitivity to olaparib, and intermediate prognosis. S-II is luminal/metabolism-active and responsive to androgen deprivation therapy with frequent TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and a good prognosis. S-III is characterized by moderate proliferative and metabolic activity, sensitivity to taxane-based chemotherapy, and intermediate prognosis. S-IV is highly proliferative with moderate EMT and stemness, frequent deletions of TP53, PTEN and RB, and the poorest prognosis; it is also immune-inflamed and sensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Overall, based on miRNA-regulated gene profiles, this study identified four distinct PCa subtypes that could improve risk stratification at diagnosis and provide therapeutic guidance.

Heterogeneity is governed by a handful of key mutations-first of all, of the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene. It drastically affects DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale. DNA methylation acts as an important regulator of gene transcription with consequences for glioma physiology. We here present a combined gene expression and DNA methylation study with the focus on lower-grade (II-III), adult-type gliomas. It aimed at deciphering glioma heterogeneity into molecular subtypes at a finer granularity level and at characterizing the underlying modes of gene regulation. Our analysis made use of high-resolution molecular portrayal, a machine learning approach to visualize complex genomic data. The results support the importance of epigenetics for glioma diversity and, in consequence, for prognosis and epigenetics-directed treatment. Molecular mechanisms of lower-grade (II-III) diffuse gliomas (LGG) are still poorly understood, mainly because of their heterogeneity. They split into astrocytoma- (IDH-A) and oligodendroglioma-like (IDH-O) tumors both carrying mutations(s) at the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene and into IDH wild type (IDH-wt) gliomas of glioblastoma resemblance. We generated detailed maps of the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes, revealing that cell functions divided into three major archetypic hallmarks: (i) increased proliferation in IDH-wt and, to a lesser degree, IDH-O; (ii) increased inflammation in IDH-A and IDH-wt; and (iii) the loss of synaptic transmission in all subtypes. Immunogenic properties of IDH-A are diverse, partly resembling signatures observed in grade IV mesenchymal glioblastomas or in grade I pilocytic astrocytomas. We analyzed details of coregulation between gene expression and DNA methylation and of the immunogenic micro-environment presumably driving tumor development and treatment resistance. Our transcriptome and methylome maps support personalized, case-by-case views to decipher the heterogeneity of glioma states in terms of data portraits. Thereby, molecular cartography provides a graphical coordinate system that links gene-level information with glioma subtypes, their phenotypes, and clinical context.

Here we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of the expression of the chondromodulin-I (ChM-I) gene, one of the chondrocyte-specific genes, in osteogenic cells using osteosarcoma ( OS) cells as a model. Methylation-specific sequence analyses revealed that the extent of methylation in the core-promoter region of the ChM-I gene was correlated inversely with the expression of the ChM-I gene in OS primary tumors and cell lines. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine treatment induced the expression of the ChM-I gene in ChM-I-negative OS cell lines, and the induction of expression was associated tightly with the demethylation of cytosine at -52 (C(-52)) in the middle of an Sp1/3 binding site to which the Sp3, but not Sp1, bound. The replacement of C(-52) with methyl-cytosine or thymine abrogated Sp3 binding and also the transcription activity of the genomic fragment including C(-52). The inhibition of Sp3 expression by small interfering RNA reduced the expression of the ChM-I gene in ChM-I-positive normal chondrocytes, indicating Sp3 as a physiological transcriptional activator of the ChM-I gene. These results suggest that the methylation status of the core-promoter region is one of the mechanisms to determine the cell-specific expression of the ChM-I gene through the regulation of the binding of Sp3.																	0021-9258	1083-351X				JUL 2	2004	279	27					28789	28797		10.1074/jbc.M401273200							WOS:000222265400117	15107420

The paradigm for the development of bone substitute materials has been shifted from inert to immunomodulatory materials, emphasizing the importance of immune cells in the material evaluation. Macrophages, the major effector cells in the immune reaction to implants, are indispensable for osteogenesis and their heterogeneity and plasticity render macrophages a primer target for immune system modulation. However, there are very few reports about the effects of macrophages on biomaterial-regulated osteogenesis. In this study, we used beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) as a model biomaterial to investigate the role of macrophages on the material stimulated osteogenesis. The macrophage phenotype switched to M2 extreme in response to beta-TCP extracts, which was related to the activation of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) pathway. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was also significantly upregulated by the beta-TCP stimulation, indicating that macrophage may participate in the beta-TCP stimulated osteogenesis. Interestingly, when macrophage-conditioned beta-TCP extracts were applied to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was significantly enhanced, indicating the important role of macrophages in biomaterial-induced osteogenesis. These findings provided valuable insights into the mechanism of material-stimulated osteogenesis, and a strategy to optimize the evaluation system for the in vitro osteogenesis capacity of bone substitute materials.

We previously showed that porcine adipose tissue-derived-stromal cells (pASC) induce conduction slowing through paracrine actions, whereas rat ASC (rASC) and human ASC (hASC) induce conduction slowing by direct coupling. We postulate that biomaterial microspheres mitigate the conduction slowing influence of pASC by interacting with paracrine signaling. Aim To investigate the modulation of ASC-loaded recombinant human collagen-based microspheres, on the electrophysiological behavior of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). Method Unipolar extracellular electrograms, derived from microelectrode arrays (8x8 electrodes) containing NRVM, co-cultured with ASC or ASC loaded microspheres, were used to determine conduction velocity (CV) and conduction heterogeneity. Conditioned medium (Cme) of (co)cultures was used to assess paracrine mechanisms. Results Microspheres did not affect CV in control (NRVM) monolayers. In co-cultures of NRVM and rASC, hASC or pASC, CV was lower than in controls (14.4+/-1.0, 13.0+/-0.6 and 9.0+/-1.0 vs. 19.5+/-0.5 cm/s respectively, p<0.001). Microspheres loaded with either rASC or hASC still induced conduction slowing compared to controls (13.5+/-0.4 and 12.6+/-0.5 cm/s respectively, p<0.001). However, pASC loaded microspheres increased CV of NRVM compared to pASC and NRMV co-cultures (16.3+/-1.3 cm/s, p<0.001) and did not differ from controls (p = NS). Cme of pASC reduced CV in control monolayers of NRVM (10.3+/-1.1 cm/s, p<0.001), similar to Cme derived from pASC-loaded microspheres (11.1+/-1.7 cm/s, p = 1.0). The presence of microspheres in monolayers of NRVM abolished the CV slowing influence of Cme pASC (15.9+/-1.0 cm/s, p = NS vs. control). Conclusion The application of recombinant human collagen-based microspheres mitigates indirect paracrine conduction slowing through interference with a secondary autocrine myocardial factor.

A regulated PNUTS mRNA to lncRNA splice switch mediates EMT and tumour progression	NATURE CELL BIOLOGY												The contribution of lncRNAs to tumour progression and the regulatory mechanisms driving their expression are areas of intense investigation. Here, we characterize the binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1) to a nucleic acid structural element located in exon 12 of PNUTS (also known as PPP1R10) pre-RNA that regulates its alternative splicing. HnRNP E1 release from this structural element, following its silencing, nucleocytoplasmic translocation or in response to TGF beta, allows alternative splicing and generates a non-coding isoform of PNUTS. Functionally the lncRNA-PNUTS serves as a competitive sponge for miR-205 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In mesenchymal breast tumour cells and in breast tumour samples, the expression of lncRNA-PNUTS is elevated and correlates with levels of ZEB mRNAs. Thus, PNUTS is a bifunctional RNA encoding both PNUTS mRNA and lncRNA-PNUTS, each eliciting distinct biological functions. While PNUTS mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, lncRNA-PNUTS appears to be tightly regulated dependent on the status of hnRNP E1 and tumour context.

Previous studies showed that mesenchymal tumors have a worse outcome than the proneural subtype. Here we focus on STAT3 as its activation precedes the proneural-mesenchymal transition. We first establish a STAT3 gene signature that stratifies GBM patients into STAT3-high and -low cohorts. STAT3 inhibitor treatment selectively mitigates STAT3-high cell viability and tumorigenicity in orthotopic mouse xenograft models. We show the mechanism underlying resistance in STAT3-low cells by combining STAT3 signature analysis with kinome screen data on STAT3 inhibitor-treated cells. This allows us to draw connections between kinases affected by STAT3 inhibitors, their associated transcription factors and target genes. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of IGF-1R and STAT3 sensitizes STAT3-low cells and improves survival in mice. Our study underscores the importance of serially profiling tumors so as to accurately target individuals who may demonstrate molecular subtype switching.

Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with frequent relapses and a high mortality, still awaits an effective treatment. Like many cancers, GBM cells acquire oncogenic properties, including metabolic reprogramming, vital for growth. As such, tumor metabolism is an emerging avenue for cancer therapy. One relevant target is the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a mitochondrial protein controlling cell energy and metabolic homeostasis. Methods. We used VDAC1-specific short interfering (si) RNA (si-VDAC1) to treat GBM cell lines and subcutaneous or intracranial-orthotopic GBM xenograft mouse models. Tumors were monitored using MRI, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR, transcription factor expression, and DNA microarray analyses. Results. Silencing VDAC1 expression using si-VDAC1 in 9 glioblastoma-related cell lines, including patient-derived cells, led to marked decreases in VDAC1 levels and cell growth. Using si-VDAC1 in subcutaneous or intracranial-orthotopic GBM models inhibited tumor growth and reversed oncogenic properties, such as reprogrammed metabolism, stemness, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and invasiveness. In cells in culture, siVDAC1 inhibits cancer neurosphere formation and, in tumors, targeted cancer stem cells, leading to their differentiation into neuronal-like cells. These VDAC1 depletion-mediated effects involved alterations in transcription factors regulating signaling pathways associated with cancer hallmarks. Conclusion. VDAC1 offers a target for GBM treatment, allowing for attacks on the interplay between metabolism and oncogenic signaling networks, leading to tumor cell differentiation into neuron- and astrocyte-like cells. Simultaneously attacking all of these processes, VDAC1 depletion overcame GBM heterogeneity and can replace several anticancer drugs that separately target angiogenesis, proliferation, or metabolism.

Donor-matched comparison of chondrogenic progenitors resident in human infrapatellar fat pad, synovium, and periosteum-implications for cartilage repair	CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH												Purpose: There is a clinical need to better characterize tissue sources being used for stem cell therapies. This study focuses on comparison of cells and connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) derived from native human infrapatellar fatpad (IPFP), synovium (SYN), and periosteum (PERI). Materials and Methods: IPFP, SYN, PERI were harvested from twenty-eight patients undergoing arthroplasty. CTPs were quantitatively characterized using automated colony-forming-unit assay to compare total nucleated cell concentration-[Cell], cells/mg; prevalence-(P-CTP), CTPs/million nucleated cells; CTP concentration-[CTP], CTPs/mg; proliferation and differentiation potential; and correlate outcomes with patient's age and gender. Results: [Cell] did not differ between IPFP, SYN, and PERI. P-CTP was influenced by age and gender: patients >60 years, IPFP and SYN had higher P-CTP than PERI (p < 0.001) and females had higher P-CTP in IPFP (p < 0.001) and SYN (p = 0.001) than PERI. [CTP] was influenced by age: patients <50 years, SYN (p = 0.0165) and PERI (p < 0.001) had higher [CTP] than IPFP; patients between 60 and 69 years, SYN (p < 0.001) had higher [CTP] than PERI; patients >70 years, IPFP (p = 0.006) had higher [CTP] than PERI. In patients >60 years, proliferation potential of CTPs differed significantly (SYN>IPFP>PERI); however, differentiation potentials were comparable between all three tissue sources. Conclusion: SYN and IPFP may serve as a preferred tissue source for patients >60 years, and PERI along with SYN and IPFP may serve as a preferred tissue source for patients <60 years for cartilage repair. However, the heterogeneity among the CTPs in any given tissue source suggests performance-based selection might be useful to optimize cell-sourcing strategies to improve efficacy of cellular therapies for cartilage repair.

The Cellular Origin and Evolution of Breast Cancer	COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN MEDICINE												In this review, we will discuss how the cell of origin may modulate breast cancer intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) as well as the role of ITH in the evolution of cancer. The clonal evolution and the cancer stem cell (CSC) models, as well as a model that integrates clonal evolution with a CSC hierarchy, have all been proposed to explain the development of ITH. The extent of ITH correlates with clinical outcome and reflects the cellular complexity and dynamics within a tumor. A unique subtype of breast cancer, the claudin-low subtype that is highly resistant to chemotherapy and most closely resembles mammary epithelial stem cells, will be discussed. Furthermore, we will review how the interactions among various tumor cells, some with distinct mutations, may impact breast cancer treatment. Finally, novel technologies that may help advance our understanding of ITH and lead to improvements in the design of new treatments also will be discussed.																	2157-1422					MAR	2017	7	3							a027128	10.1101/cshperspect.a027128							WOS:000397056400011	28062556

While some MDs can affect a single organ, many involve several organs, the brain being the most affected, followed by heart and/or muscle. Many of these diseases are associated with heteroplasmic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The proportion of mutated mtDNA must exceed a critical threshold to produce disease. Therefore, understanding how embryonic development determines the heteroplasmy level in each tissue could explain the organ susceptibility and the clinical heterogeneity observed in these patients. In this report, the dynamics of heteroplasmy and the influence in cardiac commitment of the mutational load of the m.13513G>A mutation has been analyzed. This mutation has been reported as a frequent cause of Leigh syndrome (LS) and is commonly associated with cardiac problems. In this report, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc) technology has been used to delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac disease in LS. When mutation m.13513G>A is above a threshold, iPSc-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSc-CMs) could not be obtained due to an inefficient epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Surprisingly, these cells are redirected toward neuroectodermal lineages that would give rise to the brain. However, when mutation is below that threshold, dysfunctional CM are generated in a mutant-load dependent way. We suggest that distribution of the m.13513G>A mutation during cardiac differentiation is not at random.

Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specificmarker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In situ hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to a-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. Significance: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.

Here, we investigated the role of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a downstream target of TGF beta, in regulating BCSCs in TNBC. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that COX-2 is highly expressed in TNBC and that its expression correlated with poor survival outcome in basal subtype of breast cancer. We also found TGF beta-mediated COX-2 expression to be Smad3-dependent and to be required for BCSC self-renewal and expansion in TNBCs. Knocking down COX-2 expression strikingly blocked TGF beta-induced tumorsphere formation and TGF beta-induced enrichment of the two stem-like cell populations, CD24(low)CD44(high) and ALDH+BCSCs. Blocking COX-2 activity, using a pharmacological inhibitor also prevented TGF beta-induced BCSC self-renewal. Moreover, we found COX-2 to be required for TGF beta-induced expression of mesenchymal and basal breast cancer markers. In particular, we found that TGF beta-induced expression of fibronectin plays a central role in TGF beta-mediated breast cancer stemness. Together, our results describe a novel role for COX-2 in mediating the TGF beta effects on BCSC properties and imply that targeting the COX-2 pathway may prove useful for the treatment of TNBC by eliminating BCSCs.

Heterogeneity of osteochondral tissue necessitates tailorable bone and cartilage specific extracellular environment. Carboxylate-and sulfate-functionalized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) create an acidic ambience to support chondrogenic activity, whereas phosphate rich environment in bone enables chelation of calcium leading to the formation of mineralized matrix along with an alkaline environment to support osteogenesis. In this study, chitosan, a naturally occurring GAGs, was functionalized with phosphate/sulfate groups analogous to bone/cartilage ECM and incorporated in thermogelling agarose hydrogel for delivery to osteochondral defects. In vitro studies revealed significantly higher adhesion and proliferation of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) with blended hydrogels as compared to that of native agarose. Cell differentiation and RT-PCR studies of the phosphorylated hydrogels revealed higher osteogenic potential, while sulfated hydrogels demonstrated enhanced chondrogenic activity in comparison to agarose. Recovery of osteochondral defects after delivery of the thermoresponsive agarose-based hydrogels decorated with phosphorylated derivatives showed significantly higher bone formation. On the other hand, cartilage formation was significant with chitosan sulfate decorated hydrogels. The study highlights the role of chitosan derivatives in osteochondral defect healing, especially phosphorylated ones as bone promoter, whereas sulfated ones act as cartilage enhancer, which was quantitatively distinguished through micro-CT-based noninvasive imaging and analysis.

S	Kim, J		Birbrair, A		Kim, Jiha			Pericytes in Breast Cancer	PERICYTE BIOLOGY IN DISEASE	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease driven not only by evolutionally diverse cancer cell themselves but also by highly dynamic microenvironment. At the center of the tumor microenvironment, tumor vasculature plays multiple roles from supporting tumor growth to providing a route for metastasis to the distant organ sites. Blood vessels in breast cancer present with perfusion defects associated with vessel dilation, tortuosity, and poor perivascular coverage (Li et al., Ultrasound Med 32: 1145-1155, 2013; Eberhard et al., Cancer Res 60: 1388-1393, 2000; Cooke et al., Cancer Cell 21: 66-81, 2012). Such abnormal vascular system is partly due to the morphological and molecular alteration of pericytes that is accompanied by a significant heterogeneity within the populations (Kim et al., JCI Insight 1: e90733, 2016). While pericytes are implicated for their controversial roles in breast cancer metastasis (Cooke et al., Cancer Cell 21: 66-81, 2012; Gerhardt and Semb, J Mol Med (Berl) 86: 135-144, 2008; Keskin et al., Cell Rep 10: 1066-1081, 2015; Meng et al., Future Oncol 11: 169-179, 2015; Xian et al., J Clin Invest 116: 642-651, 2006), the impact of their heterogeneity on breast cancer progression, metastasis, intratumoral immunity, and response to chemotherapy are largely unknown. Due to the complexity of angiogenic programs of breast cancer, the anti-angiogenic or anti-vascular treatment has been mostly unsuccessful (Tolaney et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 112: 14325-14330, 2015; Mackey et al., Cancer Treat Rev 38: 673-688, 2012; Sledge, J Clin Oncol 33: 133-135, 2015) and requires much in-depth knowledge on different components of tumor microenvironment and how these stromal cells are interacting and communicating to each other. Therefore, understanding pericyte heterogeneity and their differential functional contribution will shed light on new potential approaches to treat breast cancer.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-16908-4; 978-3-030-16907-7				2019	1147						93	107		10.1007/978-3-030-16908-4_3	10.1007/978-3-030-17779-9						WOS:000471688400004	31147873

The T-box transcription factor 3 is a promising biomarker and a key regulator of the oncogenic phenotype of a diverse range of sarcoma subtypes	ONCOGENESIS												Sarcomas represent a complex group of malignant neoplasms of mesenchymal origin and their heterogeneity poses a serious diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. There is therefore a need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of the more than 70 distinguishable sarcoma subtypes. The transcription factor TBX3, a critical developmental regulator, is overexpressed in several cancers of epithelial origin where it contributes to tumorigenesis by different molecular mechanisms. However, the status and role of TBX3 in sarcomas have not been reported. Here we show that a diverse subset of soft tissue and bone sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived sarcoma tissues express high levels of TBX3. We further explore the significance of this overexpression using a small interferring RNA approach and demonstrate that TBX3 promotes the migratory ability of chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma cells but inhibits fibrosarcoma cell migration. This suggested that TBX3 may play a key role in the development of different sarcoma subtypes by functioning as either an oncoprotein or as a brake to prevent tumour progression. To further explore this, TBX3 knockdown and overexpression cell culture models were established using chondrosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cells as representatives of each scenario, and the resulting cells were characterized with regard to key features of tumorigenesis. Results from in vitro and in vivo assays reveal that, while TBX3 promotes substrate-dependent and -independent cell proliferation, migration and tumour formation in chondrosarcoma cells, it discourages fibrosarcoma formation. Our findings provide novel evidence linking TBX3 to cancers of mesenchymal origin. Furthermore, we show that TBX3 may be a biomarker for the diagnosis of histologically dynamic sarcoma subtypes and that it impacts directly on their oncogenic phenotype. Indeed, we reveal that TBX3 may exhibit oncogene or tumour suppressor activity in sarcomas, which suggests that its role in cancer progression may rely on cellular context.

We established mouse clonal skeletal progenitors with distinct differentiation properties and analyzed their transcriptome. Unipotent osteogenic and adipogenic cells expressed specific transcriptional programs, whereas bipotent clones combined expression of those genes and did not show a unique signature. We tested potential regulators of line-age commitment and found that in the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) adipogenic clones can be induced to osteogenesis and that their adipogenic capacity is inhibited. Analysis of IFN gamma-regulated genes showed that lineage signatures and fate commitment of skeletal progenitors were controlled by EGR1 and EGR2. Knockdown experiments revealed that EGR1 is a positive regulator of the adipogenic transcriptional program and differentiation capacity, whereas EGR2 inhibits the osteogenic program and potency. Therefore, our work revealed transcriptional signatures of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages and mechanism triggering cell fate.

Site-specific gene expression profiling as a novel strategy for unravelling keloid disease pathobiology	PLOS ONE												Keloid disease (KD) is a fibroproliferative cutaneous tumour characterised by heterogeneity, excess collagen deposition and aggressive local invasion. Lack of a validated animal model and resistance to a multitude of current therapies has resulted in unsatisfactory clinical outcomes of KD management. In order to address KD from a new perspective, we applied for the first time a site-specific in situ microdissection and gene expression profiling approach, through combined laser capture microdissection and transcriptomic array. The aim here was to analyse the utility of this approach compared with established methods of investigation, including whole tissue biopsy and monolayer cell culture techniques. This study was designed to approach KD from a hypothesis-free and compartment-specific angle, using state-of-the-art microdissection and gene expression profiling technology. We sought to characterise expression differences between specific keloid lesional sites and elucidate potential contributions of significantly dysregulated genes to mechanisms underlying keloid pathobiology, thus informing future explorative research into KD. Here, we highlight the advantages of our in situ microdissection strategy in generating expression data with improved sensitivity and accuracy over traditional methods. This methodological approach supports an active role for the epidermis in the pathogenesis of KD through identification of genes and upstream regulators implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation and immune modulation. We describe dermal expression patterns crucial to collagen deposition that are associated with TGF beta-mediated signalling, which have not previously been examined in KD. Additionally, this study supports the previously proposed presence of a cancer-like stem cell population in KD and explores the possible contribution of gene dysregulation to the resistance of KD to conventional therapy. Through this innovative in situ microdissection gene profiling approach, we provide better-defined gene signatures of distinct KD regions, thereby addressing KD heterogeneity, facilitating differential diagnosis with other cutaneous fibroses via transcriptional fingerprinting, and highlighting key areas for future KD research.

Identification of a Candidate Proteomic Signature to Discriminate Multipotent and Non-Multipotent Stromal Cells	PLOS ONE												Bone marrow stromal cell cultures contain multipotent cells that may have therapeutic utility for tissue restoration; however, the identity of the cell that maintains this function remains poorly characterized. We have utilized a unique model of murine bone marrow stroma in combination with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to compare the nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane associated proteomes of multipotent (MSC) (CD105+) and non-multipotent (CD105-) stromal cells. Among the 25 most reliably identified proteins, 10 were verified by both real-time PCR and Western Blot to be highly enriched, in CD105+ cells and were members of distinct biological pathways and functional networks. Five of these proteins were also identified as potentially expressed in human MSC derived from both standard and serum free human stromal cultures. The quantitative amount of each protein identified in human stromal cells was only minimally affected by media conditions but varied highly between bone marrow donors. This study provides further evidence of heterogeneity among cultured bone marrow stromal cells and identifies potential candidate proteins that may prove useful for identifying and quantifying both murine and human MSC in vitro.

Genetic driver mutations define the expression signature and microenvironmental composition of high-grade gliomas	GLIA												High-grade gliomas (HGG), including glioblastomas, are characterized by invasive growth, resistance to therapy, and high inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The key histological hallmarks of glioblastoma are pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation, which allow pathologists to distinguish glioblastoma from lower-grade gliomas. In addition to being genetically and molecularly heterogeneous, HGG are also heterogeneous with respect to the composition of their microenvironment. The question of whether this microenvironmental heterogeneity is driven by the molecular identity of the tumor remains controversial. However, this question is of utmost importance since microenvironmental, non-neoplastic cells are key components of the most radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-resistant niches of the tumor. Our work demonstrates a versatile, reliable, and reproducible adult HGG mouse model with NF1-silencing as a driver mutation. This model shows significant differences in tumor microenvironment, expression of subtype-specific markers, and response to standard therapy when compared to our established PDGFB-overexpressing HGG mouse model. PDGFB-overexpressing and NF1-silenced murine tumors closely cluster with human proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, as well as PDGFRA-amplified and NF1-deleted/mutant human tumors, respectively, at both the RNA and protein expression levels. These models can be generated in fully immunocompetent mixed or C57BL/6 genetic background mice, and therefore can easily be incorporated into preclinical studies for cancer cell-specific or immune cell-targeting drug discovery studies.

The Cancer Genome Atlas network has described a gene expression-based molecular classification of HGS-OvCa into Differentiated, Mesenchymal, Immunoreactive and Proliferative subtypes. However, the biological underpinnings and regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinct molecular subtypes are largely unknown. Here we showed that tumor-infiltrating stromal cells significantly contributed to the assignments of Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive clusters. Using reverse engineering and an unbiased interrogation of subtype regulatory networks, we identified the transcriptional modules containing master regulators that drive gene expression of Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive HGS-OvCa. Mesenchymal master regulators were associated with poor prognosis, while Immunoreactive master regulators positively correlated with overall survival. Meta-analysis of 749 HGS-OvCa expression profiles confirmed that master regulators as a prognostic signature were able to predict patient outcome. Our data unraveled master regulatory programs of HGS-OvCa subtypes with prognostic and potentially therapeutic relevance, and suggested that the unique transcriptional and clinical characteristics of ovarian Mesenchymal and Immunoreactive subtypes could be, at least partially, ascribed to tumor microenvironment.

Epigenetic Reprogramming Modulates Malignant Properties of Human Liver Cancer	HEPATOLOGY												Reversal of DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is an emerging cancer therapy approach. Here we addressed the impact of epigenetic alterations and cellular context on functional and transcriptional reprogramming of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Our strategy employed a 3-day treatment of established and primary human HCC-derived cell lines grown as a monolayer at various cell densities with the DNMT1 inhibitor zebularine (ZEB) followed by a 3D culture to identify cells endowed with selfrenewal potential. Differences in self-renewal, gene expression, tumorigenicity, and metastatic potential of spheres at generations G1-G5 were examined. Transient ZEB exposure produced differential cell density-dependent responses. In cells grown at low density, ZEB caused a remarkable increase in self-renewal and tumorigenicity associated with long-lasting gene expression changes characterized by a stable overexpression of cancer stem cell-related and key epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. These effects persisted after restoration of DNMT1 expression. In contrast, at high cell density, ZEB caused a gradual decrease in self-renewal and tumorigenicty, and up-regulation of apoptosis- and differentiation-related genes. A permanent reduction of DNMT1 protein using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated DNMT1 silencing rendered HCC cells insensitive both to cell density and ZEB effects. Similarly, WRL68 and HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells expressing low DNMT1 basal levels also possessed a high self-renewal, irrespective of cell density or ZEB exposure. Spheres formed by low-density cells treated with ZEB or shDNMT1 displayed a high molecular similarity which was sustained through consecutive generations, confirming the essential role of DNMT1 depletion in the enhancement of cancer stem cell properties. Conclusion: These results identify DNA methylation as a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism determining the pool of cancer stem cells in liver cancer and possibly other solid tumors.

The authors report the case of an 11-month-old male who presented with a local abdominal, bones, and bone marrow. This is the first reported MEW and systemic metastases into lungs, liver case of an MEM with initial bone marrow dissemination. The tumor consisted of a neuroblastoma component and a mesenchymal component with sarcomatous features. Diagnosis and therapy were complicated by the histological heterogeneity of the tumor which also influenced the clinical appearance and course in this case. A literature search revealed 15 other evaluated cases that arose in soft tissue and had adequate clinicopathologic data. Complete surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, and chemotherapy also appeared to be important. In all reported patients (n = 3) with initial metastases or bone morrow dissemination, as in this case, no cure could be achieved. In patients with disseminated MEM, new therapeutic approaches such as high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue should be considered, similar to the current strategy in patients with stage IV neuroblastoma or soft tissue sarcoma.				muller, Hermann l/AAC-1637-2020	Muller, Hermann L./0000-0003-4929-9966												0888-0018					JAN-FEB	2002	19	1					9	17		10.1080/088800102753356149							WOS:000173006200002	11787870

Epithelial plasticity can generate multi-lineage phenotypes in human and murine bladder cancers	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Tumor heterogeneity is common in cancer, however recent studies have applied single gene expression signatures to classify bladder cancers into distinct subtypes. Such stratification assumes that a predominant transcriptomic signature is sufficient to predict progression kinetics, patient survival and treatment response. We hypothesize that such static classification ignores intra-tumoral heterogeneity and the potential for cellular plasticity occurring during disease development. We have conducted single cell transcriptome analyses of mouse and human model systems of bladder cancer and show that tumor cells with multiple lineage subtypes not only cluster closely together at the transcriptional level but can maintain concomitant gene expression of at least one mRNA subtype. Functional studies reveal that tumor initiation and cellular plasticity can initiate from multiple lineage subtypes. Collectively, these data suggest that lineage plasticity may contribute to innate tumor heterogeneity, which in turn carry clinical implications regarding the classification and treatment of bladder cancer. Recent studies have utilized bulk tumour mRNA sequencing to classify bladder cancers into distinct subgroups. Here, the authors use single cell transcriptomic analysis and cell transplant studies to show that epithelial plasticity can generate basal, luminal and mesenchymal phenotypes in human and murine bladder cancers.

The mechanism underlying this poor prognosis and heterogeneity is not well understood. We have developed an unbiased, adaptive clustering approach to integratively analyze ovarian cancer genome-wide gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA expression, and copy number alteration profiles. We uncovered seven previously uncategorized subtypes of ovarian cancer that differ significantly in median survival time. We then developed an algorithm to uncover molecular signatures that distinguish cancer subtypes. Surprisingly, although the good-prognosis subtypes seem to have not been functionally selected, the poor-prognosis ones clearly have been. One subtype has an epithelial-mesenchymal transition signature and a cancer hallmark network, whereas the other two subtypes are enriched for a network centered on SRC and KRAS. Our results suggest molecular signatures that are highly predictive of clinical outcomes and spotlight "driver" genes that could be targeted by subtype-specific treatments.

Moreover, efforts to develop new strategies for CTCs isolation and characterisation, and the translation of CTCs into clinical practice needs to overcome the limitation associated with the sole use of Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) expression to purify this tumour cell subpopulation. CTCs are rare events in the blood of patients and are believed to represent the epithelial population from a primary tumour of epithelial origin, thus EpCAM immunoisolation is considered an appropriate strategy. The controversy stems from the impact that the more aggressive mesenchymal tumour phenotypes might have on the whole CTC population. In this work, we first characterised a panel of cell lines representative of tumour heterogeneity, confirming the existence of tumour cell subpopulations with restricted epithelial features and supporting the limitations of EpCAM-based technologies. We next developed customised polystyrene magnetic beads coated with antibodies to efficiently isolate the phenotypically different subpopulations of CTCs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with metastatic cancer. Besides EpCAM, we propose Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) as an additional isolation marker for efficient CTCs detection.

In the past, the resting keratocytes were thought of as a homogenous cellular population, but recent work has shown local variations in vimentin and nestin expression, and responsiveness to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1. Studies have also supported there being "stromal stem cells" in localized areas. After corneal wounding, depending on the site and severity of injury, profound changes in stromal cellularity occur. Anterior or posterior injuries to the epithelium or endothelium, respectively, trigger apoptosis of adjacent keratocytes. Many contiguous keratocytes transition to keratocan-negative corneal fibroblasts that are proliferative and produce limited amounts of disorganized extracellular matrix components. Simultaneously, large numbers of bone marrow-derived cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, fibrocytes and lymphocytes, invade the stroma from the limbal blood vessels. Ongoing adequate levels of TGF beta 1, TGF beta 2 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from epithelium, tears, endothelium and aqueous humor that penetrate defective or absent epithelial barrier function (EBF) and epithelial basement membrane (EBM) and/or Descemet's basement membrane (DBM) drive corneal fibroblasts and fibrocytes to differentiate into alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. If the EBF, EBM and/or DBM are repaired or replaced in a timely manner, typically measured in weeks, then corneal fibroblast and fibrocyte progeny, deprived of requisite levels of TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2, undergo apoptosis or revert to their precursor cell-types. If the EBF, EBM and/or DBM are not repaired or replaced, stromal levels of TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 remain elevated, and mature myofibroblasts are generated from corneal fibroblasts and fibrocyte precursors that produce prodigious amounts of disordered extracellular matrix materials associated with scarring fibrosis. This fibrotic stromal matrix persists, at least until the EBF, EBM and/or DBM are regenerated or replaced, and keratocytes remove and reorganize the affected stromal matrix.				; Wilson, Steven/C-6140-2018	Sampaio, Lycia/0000-0003-4640-6527; Thomas, Shiju/0000-0002-3972-0414; Wilson, Steven/0000-0001-8121-960X												0014-4835	1096-0007				JAN	2021	202								108303	10.1016/j.exer.2020.108303							WOS:000608182800007	33068626

Here, we present our 9-year experience for the consistent isolation of CBMSCs. Although nearly one CB unit out of two retains the potential to give rise to MSC colonies, only 46% of them can be cultured till low passages (P >= 4), but one-fourth of those reaches even higher passages (P >= 8). Subsequent characterization for morphological, clonal, differentiation, and proliferation properties revealed two divergent CBMSC behaviors. In particular, a cumulative population doublings cut-off (CPD=15) was identified that undoubtedly distinguishes two growth curves, and different degrees of commitment toward osteogenesis were observed. These data clearly show the existence of at least two distinct CBMSC subsets: one mainly short-living and less proliferative (SL-CBMSCs), the other long-living, with higher growth rate, and, very importantly, with significantly (P <= 0.01) longer telomere (LL-CBMSCs). Moreover, significant differences in the immunoprofile before seeding were found among CB units giving rise to LL-CBMSCs or SL-CBMSCs or showing no colony formation. Finally, all the aforementioned results provided a peculiar and useful set of parameters potentially predictive for CBMSC culture outcome.

Some of these cells exhibit multipotency, whereas others do not. Multiparameter flow cytometry analysis shows that a large number of distinct populations of fibroblast-like cells can be found in cultures initiated from different embryonic organs, and cells sorted according to their surface phenotype typically retain their characteristics on continued propagation in culture. Similarly, surface phenotypes of individual cloned fibroblast-like cells exhibit significant variation. The fibroblast cell class appears to contain a very large number of denumerable subtypes.

Therefore, we aimed to characterize OA ST and to compare mechanical and enzymatic digestion procedures to find the one that better preserve the heterogeneity of the main OA synovial cell populations: fibroblasts and macrophages. We demonstrated that typical macrophage phenotypical markers, like CD68, CD80 and CD163, were higher expressed on cells isolated with mechanical than enzymatic procedure. Moreover, we found that typical cytokines of inflammatory macrophages (i.e., TNF alpha) and anti-inflammatory macrophages (i.e., IL10) were also higher on mechanically isolated cells. Synovial fibroblasts were well conserved in both procedures. The definition of an OA ST model in vitro that better preserve the heterogeneity of specific cell populations represents a prerequisite for defining the real effects of new cell therapies or drugs for OA treatment, and could contribute to the reduction or avoidance of animal models. There is a lack ofin vitromodels able to properly represent osteoarthritis (OA) synovial tissue (ST). We aimed to characterize OA ST and to investigate whether a mechanical or enzymatic digestion procedures influence synovial cell functional heterogeneity in vitro. Procedures using mechanical nondigested fragments (NDF), synovial digested fragments (SDF), and filtrated synovial digested cells (SDC) were compared. An immunophenotypic profile was performed to distinguish synovial fibroblasts (CD55, CD73, CD90, CD106), macrophages (CD14, CD68), M1-like (CD80, CD86), and M2-like (CD163, CD206) synovial macrophages. Pro-inflammatory (interleukin 6 IL6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3/MIP1 alpha), C-X- motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin 10 (IL10)), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) cytokines were evaluated. CD68 and CD163 markers were higher in NDF and SDF compared to the SDC procedure, while CD80, CD86, and CD206 were higher only in NDF compared to the SDC procedure. Synovial fibroblast markers showed similar percentages. TNF alpha, CCL3/MIP1 alpha, CXCL10/IP10, and CCL18 were higher in NDF compared to SDC, but not compared to SDF. IL10 and TGF beta 1 were higher in NDF than SDC at the molecular level, while IL6 did not show differences among procedures. We demonstrated that NDF isolation procedures better preserved the heterogeneity of specific OA synovial populations (fibroblasts, macrophages), fostering their use for testing new cell therapies or drugs for OA, reducing or avoiding the use of animal models.

Currently, TNM-classification and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are the sole clinical prognosticators of outcome. Tumor heterogeneity and stemness based on epithelial-mesenchymal-transition reportedly associate with therapy resistance. The capacity of epithelial marker EpCAM (EpEX), stemness regulator Sox2 and mesenchymal marker vimentin to predict clinical outcome of HSNCC patients was assessed upon immunohistochemistry staining in two cohorts of HNSCC patients treated with surgery and adjuvant radio (chemo) therapy (n = 94) and primary radio (chemo) therapy (n = 94), respectively. Prognostic values with respect to overall, disease-free and disease-specific survival were assessed in uni- and multivariate cox proportional hazard models to generate integrated risk scores. EpEX, Sox2 and vimentin displayed substantial inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. EpEX(high) and Sox2(hi)(gh )predicted improved clinical outcome in the discovery cohort and in the HPV-negative sub-cohort. EpEX(high) and Sox2(high) were confirmed as prognosticators of clinical outcome in the validation cohort treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. Importantly, EpEX(high) identified patients with improved survival within the HPV-negative subgroup of the validation cohort. Hence, Sox2(high) and particularly EpEX(high) have potential as tools to predict clinical performance of HNSCC patients, foremost HPV-negative cases, in the frame of molecular-guided treatment decision-making.

Nonetheless, the high degree of nonresponders, and in some cases the emergence of resistance in patients who do initially respond, represents a significant challenge in the field of cancer immunotherapy. These issues prompt much more extensive studies to better understand how cancer cells escape immune surveillance and resist immune attacks. Here, we review the current knowledge of how cellular heterogeneity and plasticity could be involved in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in controlling antitumor immunity. Indeed, recent findings have led to increased interest in the mechanisms by which cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or oscillating within the EMT spectrum, might contribute to immune escape through multiple routes. This includes shaping of the TME and decreased susceptibility to immune effector cells. Although much remains to be learned on the mechanisms at play, cancer cell clones with mesenchymal features emerging from the TME seem to be primed to face immune attacks by specialized killer cells of the immune system, the natural killer cells, and the cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Recent studies investigating patient tumors have suggested EMT as a candidate predictive marker to be explored for immunotherapy outcome. Promising data also exist on the potential utility of targeting these cancer cell populations to at least partly overcome such resistance. Research is now underway which may lead to considerable progress in optimization of treatments.

Surgery treatment seems to be the best efficacious approach for the majority of patients. However, a consistent fraction (30%) of cases progress after surgery with curative intent. It is currently largely debated the use of adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients and the clinical and molecular parameters for stratifying beneficiary categories. In addition, the treatment of advanced forms lacks reliable driver biomarkers for the appropriated therapeutic choice. Thus, renal cancer patient management urges predictive molecular indicators and models for therapy-decision making. Methods: Here, we developed and optimized new models and tools for ameliorating renal cancer patient management. We isolated from fresh tumor specimens heterogeneous multi-clonal populations showing epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics coupled to stem cell phenotype. These cells retained long lasting-tumor-propagating capacity provided a therapy monitoring approach in vitro and in vivo while being able to form parental tumors when orthotopically injected and serially transplanted in immunocompromised murine hosts. Results: In line with recent evidence of multiclonal cancer composition, we optimized in vitro cultures enriched of multiple tumor-propagating populations. Orthotopic xenograft masses recapitulated morphology, grading and malignancy of parental cancers. High-grade but not the low-grade neoplasias, resulted in efficient serial transplantation in mice. Engraftment capacity paralleled grading and recurrence frequency advocating for a prognostic value of our developed model system. Therefore, in search of novel molecular indicators for therapy decision-making, we used Reverse-Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) to analyze a panel of total and phosphorylated proteins in the isolated populations. Tumor-propagating cells showed several deregulated kinase cascades associated with grading, including angiogenesis and m-TOR pathways. Conclusions: In the era of personalized therapy, the analysis of tumor propagating cells may help improve prediction of disease progression and therapy assignment. The possibility to test pharmacological response of ccRCC stem-like cells in vitro and in orthotopic models may help define a pharmacological profiling for future development of more effective therapies. Likewise, RPPA screening on patient-derived populations offers innovative approach for possible prediction of therapy response.

It has recently been proposed that, rather than being a binary process, EMT occurs through distinct intermediate states. However, there is no direct in vivo evidence for this idea. Here we screen a large panel of cell surface markers in skin and mammary primary tumours, and identify the existence of multiple tumour subpopulations associated with different EMT stages: from epithelial to completely mesenchymal states, passing through intermediate hybrid states. Although all EMT subpopulations presented similar tumour-propagating cell capacity, they displayed differences in cellular plasticity, invasiveness and metastatic potential. Their transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes identify the underlying gene regulatory networks, transcription factors and signalling pathways that control these different EMT transition states. Finally, these tumour subpopulations are localized in different niches that differentially regulate EMT transition states.

Fusion of SS18 to SSX generates an aberrant transcriptional regulator, which, in permissive cells, drives tumor development by initiating major chromatin remodeling events that disrupt the balance between BAF-mediated gene activation and polycomb-dependent repression. Here, we developed SyS organoids and performed genome-wide epigenomic profiling of these models and mesenchymal precursors to define SyS-specific chromatin remodeling mechanisms and dependencies. We show that SS18-SSX induces broad BAF domains at its binding sites, which oppose polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 2 activity, while facilitating recruitment of a non-canonical (nc)PRC1 variant. Along with the uncoupling of polycomb complexes, we observed H3K27me3 eviction, H2AK119ub deposition and the establishment of de novo active regulatory elements that drive SyS identity. These alterations are completely reversible upon SS18-SSX depletion and are associated with vulnerability to USP7 loss, a core member of ncPRC1.1. Using the power of primary tumor organoids, our work helps define the mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation on which SyS cells are dependent.

Efficacy of thermoresponsive, photocrosslinkable hydrogels derived from decellularized tendon and cartilage extracellular matrix for cartilage tissue engineering	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE												Tissue engineering using adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a promising approach for cartilage repair, is highly dependent on the nature of the matrix scaffold. Thermoresponsive, photocrosslinkable hydrogels were fabricated by functionalizing pepsin-soluble decellularized tendon and cartilage extracellular matrices (ECM) with methacrylate groups. Methacrylated gelatin hydrogels served as controls. When seeded with human bone marrow MSCs and cultured in chondrogenic medium, methacrylated ECM hydrogels experienced less cell-mediated contraction, as compared against non-methacrylated ECM hydrogels. However, methacrylation slowed or diminished chondrogenic differentiation of seeded MSCs, as determined through analyses of gene expression, biochemical composition and histology. In particular, methacrylated cartilage hydrogels supported minimal due to chondrogenesis over 42 weeks, as hydrogel disintegration beginning at day 14 presumably compromised cell-matrix interactions. As compared against methacrylated gelatin hydrogels, MSCs cultured in non-methacrylated ECM hydrogels exhibited comparable expression of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, Aggrecan and collagen type II) but increased collagen type I expression. Non-methacrylated cartilage hydrogels did not promote chondrogenesis to a greater extent than either non-methacrylated or methacrylated tendon hydrogels. Whereas methacrylated gelatin hydrogels supported relatively homogeneous increases in proteoglycan and collagen type II deposition throughout the construct over 42 days, ECM hydrogels possessed greater heterogeneity of staining intensity and construct morphology. These results do not support the utility of pepsin-solubilized cartilage and tendon hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering over methacrylated gelatin hydrogels. Methacrylation of tendon and cartilage ECM hydrogels permits thermal- and light-induced polymerization but compromises chondrogenic differentiation of seeded MSCs.				scaglione, silvia/K-5378-2019; Ceseracciu, Luca/E-9675-2011; Goldoni, Luca/ABF-4257-2020; Scaglione, Silvia/B-7124-2014; Gottardi, Riccardo/AAA-5047-2019	scaglione, silvia/0000-0002-9464-3554; Ceseracciu, Luca/0000-0003-3296-8051; Scaglione, Silvia/0000-0002-9464-3554; Gottardi, Riccardo/0000-0001-8040-5531; Rothrauff, Benjamin/0000-0002-8301-025X												1932-6254	1932-7005				JAN	2018	12	1					E159	E170		10.1002/term.2465							WOS:000423431200015	28486778

However, 40% of samples derived from patients with better outcomes fail to engraft in immunodeficient mouse recipients when conventional protocols are followed. At diagnosis, the engraftment of intermediate-risk group samples cannot be anticipated. In this study, we decided to further explore the reasons for xenograft success and failure. No differences in extracellular phenotype, apoptosis, or cell cycle profile could distinguish samples that engraft (engrafter [E]) from samples that do not engraft (nonengrafter [NE]) in NSG mice. In addition, ex vivo long-term culture assay revealed, after 5 weeks, a lower content of leukemic-LTC-initiating cells in the NE samples associated with a lower expansion rate capacity. One-week co-cultures with mesenchymal or osteoblastic or endothelial cells did not influence the proliferation rate, suggesting that E and NE samples are genuinely rapidly or slowly expanding independent of external cue. Engraftment success for some NE samples was consistently observed in recipient mice analyzed 6 months later than the conventional 3-month period. Eventually we implemented a flow cytometry-based assay, which allowed us to predict, in 1 week, the fast or delayed engraftment potential of a noncharacterized acute myeloid leukemia sample. This approach will be especially useful in selecting intermediate-risk-group patient samples and restricting the experimental duration to a 3-month period and, eventually, in reducing the number of animals and the cost and effort of unnecessary xenograft failures.

The cellular heterogeneity within CTC populations is of great clinical importance regarding the increasing number of adjuvant treatment options for patients with metastatic carcinomas, in order to eliminate residual disease. Moreover, the molecular profiling of these rare cells might lead to insight on disease progression and therapeutic strategies than simple CTCs counting. In the present study we investigated the feasibility to detect KRAS, BRAF, CD133 and Plastin3 (PLS3) mutations in an enriched CTCs cell suspension from patients with colorectal cancer, with the hypothesis that these genes mutations are of great importance regarding the generation of CTCs subpopulations. Subsequently, we compared CTCs mutational status with that of the corresponding primary tumor, in order to access the possibility of tumor cells characterization without biopsy. CTCs were detected and isolated from blood drawn from 52 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using a quantum-dot-labelled magnetic immunoassay method. Mutations were detected by PCR-RFLP or allele-specific PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. In 52 patients, discordance between primary tumor and CTCs was 5.77% for KRAS, 3.85% for BRAF, 11.54% for CD133 rs3130, 7.69% for CD133 rs2286455 and 11.54% for PLS3 rs6643869 mutations. Our results support that DNA mutational analysis of CTCs may enable non-invasive, specific biomarker diagnostics and expand the scope of personalized medicine for cancer patients.

We performed gene expression profiling of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) isolated from normal C57BL/6 mice or mice inoculated with syngeneic murine leukemia cells carrying different human AML genotypes, developed in mice with Trp53 wild-type or null genetic backgrounds. We identified a set of genes whose expression in BM-MSC was modulated by all four AML genotypes tested. In addition, there were sets of differentially-expressed genes in AML-exposed BM-MSC that were unique to the particular AML genotype or Trp53 status. Our findings support the hypothesis that leukemia cells alter the transcriptome of surrounding BM stromal cells, in both common and genotype-specific ways. These changes are likely to be advantageous to AML cells, affecting disease progression and response to chemotherapy, and suggest opportunities for stroma-targeting therapy, including those based on AML genotype.

Heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblast population potentiates neuroendocrine differentiation and castrate resistance in a CD105-dependent manner	ONCOGENE												Heterogeneous prostatic carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) contribute to tumor progression and resistance to androgen signaling deprivation therapy (ADT). CAF subjected to extended passaging, compared to low passage CAF, were found to lose tumor expansion potential and heterogeneity. Cell surface endoglin (CD105), known to be expressed on proliferative endothelia and mesenchymal stem cells, was diminished in high passage CAF. RNA-sequencing revealed SFRP1 to be distinctly expressed by tumor-inductive CAF, which was further demonstrated to occur in a CD105-dependent manner. Moreover, ADT resulted in further expansion of the CD105(+) fibroblastic population and downstream SFRP1 in 3-dimensional cultures and patient-derived xenograft tissues. In patients, CD105(+) fibroblasts were found to circumscribe epithelia with neuroendocrine differentiation. CAF-derived SFRP1, driven by CD105 signaling, was necessary and sufficient to induce prostate cancer neuroendocrine differentiation in a paracrine manner. A partially humanized CD105 neutralizing antibody, TRC105, inhibited fibroblastic SFRP1 expression and epithelial neuroendocrine differentiation. In a novel synthetic lethality paradigm, we found that simultaneously targeting the epithelia and its microenvironment with ADT and TRC105, respectively, reduced castrate-resistant tumor progression, in a model where either ADT or TRC105 alone had little effect.

Therefore, they can enhance the treatment efficiency of drug-resistant cancers. Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of fenofibrate (FF) suggest that it can be used for the metronomic chemotherapy of drug-resistant prostate tumors. To estimate the effect of FF on the drug-resistance of prostate cancer cells, we compared the reactions of naive and drug-resistant cells to the combined treatment with docetaxel (DCX)/mitoxantrone (MTX) and FF. FF sensitized drug-resistant DU145 and PC3 cells to DCX and MTX, as illustrated by their reduced viability and invasive potential observed in the presence of DCX/MTX and FF. The synergy of the cytostatic activities of both agents was accompanied by the inactivation of P-gp-dependent efflux, dysfunction of the microtubular system, and induction of polyploidy in DCX-resistant cells. Chemical inhibition of PPAR alpha- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent pathways by GW6471 and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, respectively, had no effect on cell sensitivity to combined DCX/FF treatment. Instead, we observed the signs of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) deficit and autophagy in DCX/FF-treated drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, the cells that had been permanently propagated under DCX- and DCX/FF-induced stress did not acquire DCX/FF-resistance. Instead, relatively slow proliferation of DCX-resistant cells was efficiently inhibited by FF. Collectively, our observations show that FF reduces the effective doses of DCX by interfering with the drug resistance and energy metabolism of prostate cancer cells. Concomitantly, it impairs the chemotherapy-induced microevolution and expansion of DCX/FF-resistant cells. Therefore, FF can be applied as a metronomic agent to enhance the efficiency of palliative chemotherapy of prostate cancer.				; Siedlar, Maciej/U-9190-2018; Elas, Martyna/E-3584-2017	Wrobel, Tomasz/0000-0001-9194-9753; Labedz-Maslowska, Anna/0000-0002-8088-6221; Madeja, Zbigniew/0000-0002-5523-1215; Piwowarczyk, Katarzyna/0000-0002-2292-8948; Siedlar, Maciej/0000-0002-3904-5412; Luty, Marcin/0000-0002-8332-8962; Elas, Martyna/0000-0001-6296-2844; Szczygiel, Malgorzata/0000-0002-9548-1868												2072-6694					JAN	2019	11	1							77	10.3390/cancers11010077							WOS:000457233300059	30641904

Host-Derived Pericytes and Sca-1(+) Cells Predominate in the MART-1(-) Stroma Fraction of Experimentally Induced Melanoma	JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY & CYTOCHEMISTRY												Identification of cell types in tumor-associated stroma that are involved in the development of melanoma is hampered by their heterogeneity. The authors used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that anti-MART-1 antibodies can discriminate between melanoma and stroma cells. They investigated the cellular composition of the MART-1(-), non-hematopoietic melanoma-associated stroma, finding it consisted mainly of Sca-1(+) and CD146(+) cells. These cell types were also observed in the skin and muscle adjacent to developing melanomas. The Sca-1+ cell population was observed distributed in the epidermis, hair follicle bulges, and tumor capsule. The CD146(+) population was found distributed within the tumor, mainly associated with blood vessels in a perivascular location. In addition to a perivascular distribution, CD1468(+) cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin, lacked expression of endothelial markers CD31 and CD34, and were therefore identified as pericytes. Pericytes were found to be associated with CD31(+) endothelial cells; however, some pericytes were also observed associated with CD31(-), MART-1(+) B16 melanoma cells that appeared to form blood vessel structures. Furthermore, the authors observed extensive nuclear expression of HIF-1 alpha in melanoma and stroma cells, suggesting hypoxia is an important factor associated with the melanoma microenvironment and vascularization. The results suggest that pericytes and Sca-1(+) stroma cells are important contributors to melanoma development.

While some view fibroblasts in adult tissues as nothing more than primitive mesenchymal cells surviving embryologic development, they differ from mesenchymal cells in their unique expression of fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1). This difference raises questions about their origin. Using bone marrow chimeras and transgenic reporter mice, we show here that interstitial kidney fibroblasts derive from two sources. A small number of FSP1(+), CD34(-) fibroblasts migrate to normal interstitial spaces from bone marrow. More surprisingly, however, FSP1(+) fibroblasts also arise in large numbers by local epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during renal fibrogenesis. Both populations of fibroblasts express collagen type I and expand by cell division during tissue fibrosis. Our findings suggest that a substantial number of organ fibroblasts appear through a novel reversal in the direction of epithelial cell fate. As a general mechanism, this change in fate highlights the potential plasticity of differentiated cells in adult tissues under pathologic conditions.																	0021-9738	1558-8238				AUG	2002	110	3					341	350		10.1172/JCI200215518							WOS:000177308900010	12163453

O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is a significant prognostic marker for Temozolomide (TMZ) resistance in GBM patients.YKL-40is a molecular marker for the mesenchymal subtype of GBMs and is responsible for TMZ resistance. However, underlying mechanisms by which MGMT epigenetics impacts patient outcomes and the function of YKL-40 are not fully determined. Herein, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments, six humanIDH1/2wild-type glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) were established and studied to further determine a potential interaction of YKL-40 and MGMT promoter methylation. We demonstrated thatYKL-40functioned differently in humanIDH1/2wild-type GSCs. InMGMTpromoter-methylated (MGMT-m) GSCs, it acted as a tumor suppressor gene. On the other hand, inMGMTpromoter-unmethylated (MGMT-um) GSCs, it promoted tumorigenesis. Notably, the reason thatYKL-40played different roles in GSCs could not be interpreted by the molecular classification of each GSCs, but is a function ofMGMTpromoter methylation status and involves theRAS-MEK-ERKpathway.YKL-40mediated TMZ sensitivity by activating DNA damage responses (DDRs) inMGMT-mGSCs, and it mediated resistance to TMZ by inhibiting DDRs inMGMT-umGSCs. Our report demonstrated thatMGMTpromoter methylation status might influence a gene's function in human cancer. Moreover, our data also highlight the point that gene function should be investigated not only according to the molecular tumor classification, but also the epigenetic signature.																	2041-4889					AUG 21	2020	11	8							668	10.1038/s41419-020-02909-9							WOS:000567137300001	32820151					
J	Miska, M; Schmidmaier, G				Miska, Matthias; Schmidmaier, Gerhard			Diamond concept for treatment of nonunions and bone defects	UNFALLCHIRURG												Nonunions represent a very heterogeneous, rare and sometimes very complex disease picture. The causes, localization and degree of expression show a very high variability, which makes it difficult to establish uniform treatment standards. Nevertheless, the process of bone healing is subject to some essential factors, which should be ensured for a successful treatment. Over the years these factors have been better researched and were taken into consideration for the diamond concept, which was first published by Giannoudis et al. in 2007. This provides the physician with a concept that does not neglect the heterogeneity of the disease picture and is an aid to decision making for the treatment regimen in individual cases in order to guarantee the best biological and mechanical conditions. The diamond concept is nowadays widely used and many studies have already demonstrated a successful application. It must be understood as a framework, in which the various treatment options available (bone substitute materials, mesenchymal stem cells, osteosynthesis procedures etc.) are incorporated into the individual factors and therefore provides the physician with a certain freedom of choice in the selection of tools. Additionally, it is not a rigid corset and subject to medical scientific progress in its factors, so that it is exciting to see which new developments will be incorporated in the future.																	0177-5537	1433-044X				SEP	2020	123	9			SI		679	686		10.1007/s00113-020-00843-1		AUG 2020					WOS:000556651600001	32761357

Unfortunately, there have been very few successful attempts at identifying the primary cues that could redirect malignant tissues to a normal phenotype. Here we show that suppression of the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) leads to stable reversion of the malignant phenotype and normalizes differentiation in a model of breast cancer (BC) progression. FASN knockdown dramatically reduced tumorigenicity of BC cells and restored tissue architecture, which was reminiscent of normal ductal-like structures in the mammary gland. Loss of FASN signaling was sufficient to direct tumors to a reversed phenotype that was near normal when considering the development of polarized growth-arrested acinar-like structure similar to those formed by nonmalignant breast cells in a 3D reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. This process, in vivo, resulted in a low proliferation index, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and shut-off of the angiogenic switch in FASN-depleted BC cells orthotopically implanted into mammary fat pads. The role of FASN as a negative regulator of correct breast tissue architecture and terminal epithelial cell differentiation was dominant over the malignant phenotype of tumor cells possessing multiple cancer-driving genetic lesions as it remained stable during the course of serial in vivo passage of orthotopic tumor-derived cells. Transient knockdown of FASN suppressed hallmark structural and cytosolic/secretive proteins (vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin) in a model of EMT-induced cancer stem cells (CSC). Indirect pharmacological inhibition of FASN promoted a phenotypic switch from basal-to luminal-like tumorsphere architectures with reduced intrasphere heterogeneity. The fact that sole correction of exacerbated lipogenesis can stably reprogram cancer cells back to normal-like tissue architectures might open a new avenue to chronically restrain BC progression by using FASN-based differentiation therapies.

We previously showed that breast cancer cell line sub-groups obtained by a clustering approach using highly variable genes overlapped almost completely with sub-groups generated by a drug cytotoxicity-profile based approach. Two distinct cell populations thus identified were CSC(cancer stem cell)-like and non-CSC-like. In this study we asked whether an mRNA based gene signature identifying these two cell types would explain variation in stemness, EMT, drug sensitivity, and prognosis in silico and in vitro. Main methods: In silico analyses were performed using publicly available cell line and patient tumor datasets. In vitro analyses of phenotypic plasticity and drug responsiveness were obtained using human breast cancer cell lines. Key findings: We find a novel gene list (CNCL) that can generate both categorical and continuous variables corresponding to the stemness/EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition) state of tumors. We are presenting a novel robust gene signature that unites previous observations related either to EMT or stemness in breast cancer. We show in silico, that this signature perfectly predicts behavior of tumor cells tested in vitro, and can reflect tumor plasticity. We thus demonstrate for the first time, that breast cancer subtypes are sensitive to either Lapatinib or Midostaurin. The same gene list is not capable of predicting prognosis in most cohorts, except for one that includes patients receiving neo-adjuvant taxene therapy. Significance: CNCL is a robust gene list that can identify both stemness and the EMT state of cell lines and tumors. It can be used to trace tumor cells during the course of phenotypic changes they undergo, that result in altered responses to therapeutic agents. The fact that such a list cannot be used to identify prognosis in most patient cohorts suggests that presence of factors other than stemness and EMT affect mortality.				belder, nevin/AAQ-2166-2021; Turk, Can/AAZ-2390-2021; Canli, Secil Demirkol/AAG-8038-2020; Sahin, Ozgur/F-4403-2014	Turk, Can/0000-0003-1514-7294; Canli, Secil Demirkol/0000-0003-0200-7962; Gure, Ali Osmay/0000-0002-4064-8608; Sahin, Ozgur/0000-0002-8033-7089												1837-9664						2020	11	4					949	961		10.7150/jca.34649							WOS:000502829200021	31949498

Antiestrogen Therapy Increases Plasticity and Cancer Stemness of Prolactin-Induced ERathorn Mammary Carcinomas	CANCER RESEARCH												Although antiestrogen therapies are successful in many patients with estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER alpha(+)) breast cancer, 25% to 40% fail to respond. Although multiple mechanisms underlie evasion of these treatments, including tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistant cancer stem cells (CSC), further investigations have been limited by the paucity of preclinical ER alpha(+) tumor models. Here, we examined a mouse model of prolactin-induced aggressive ER alpha(+) breast cancer, which mimics the epidemiologic link between prolactin exposure and increased risk for metastatic ER alpha(+) tumors. Like a subset of ER alpha(+) patient cancers, the prolactin-induced adenocarcinomas contained two major tumor sub-populations that expressed markers of normal luminal and basal epithelial cells. CSC activity was distributed equally across these two tumor subpopulations. Treatment with the selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD), ICI 182,780 (ICI), did not slow tumor growth, but induced adaptive responses in CSC activity, increased markers of plasticity including target gene reporters of Wnt/Notch signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and increased double-positive (K8/K5) cells. In primary tumor-sphere cultures, ICI stimulated CSC self-renewal and was able to overcome the dependence of self-renewal upon Wnt or Notch signaling individually, but not together. Our findings demonstrate that treatment of aggressive mixed lineage ER alpha(+) breast cancers with a SERD does not inhibit growth, but rather evokes tumor cell plasticity and regenerative CSC activity, predicting likely negative impacts on patient tumors with these characteristics. Significance: This study suggests that treatment of a subset of ER alpha(+) breast cancers with antiestrogen therapies may not only fail to slow growth but also promote aggressive behavior by evoking tumor cell plasticity and regenerative CSC activity.

Discrete Molecular Classes of Ovarian Cancer Suggestive of Unique Mechanisms of Transformation and Metastases	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH												Purpose: Tumor heterogeneity and subsistence of high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (HGSC) classes can be speculated from clinical incidences suggesting passive tumor dissemination versus active invasion and metastases. Experimental Design: We explored this theme toward tumor classification through two approaches of gene expression pattern clustering: (i) derivation of a core set of metastases-associated genes and (ii) resolution of independent weighted correlation networks. Further identification of appropriate cell and xenograft models was carried out for resolution of class-specific biologic functions. Results: Both clustering approaches achieved resolution of three distinct tumor classes, two of which validated in other datasets. Networks of enriched gene modules defined biologic functions of quiescence, cell division-differentiation-lineage commitment, immune evasion, and cross-talk with niche factors. Although deviant from normal homeostatic mechanisms, these class-specific profiles are not totally random. Preliminary validation of these suggests that Class 1 tumors survive, metastasize in an epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT)-independent manner, and are associated with a p53 signature, aberrant differentiation, DNA damage, and genetic instability. These features supported by association of cell-specific markers, including PAX8, PEG3, and TCF21, led to the speculation of their origin being the fimbrial fallopian tube epithelium. On the other hand, Class 2 tumors activate extracellular matrix-EMT-driven invasion programs (Slug, SPARC, FN1, THBS2 expression), IFN signaling, and immune evasion, which are prospectively suggestive of ovarian surface epithelium associated wound healing mechanisms. Further validation of these etiologies could define a new therapeutic framework for disease management. (C)2013 AACR.

The cancer invasion due to epithelial to mesenchymal transition is affected by metabolic and oxygen availability in the tumor-associated micro-environment. A precise alteration in oxygen and metabolic signaling between healthy and metastatic cells is a substantial probe for understanding tumor progression and metastasis. Molecular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment help to sustain the metastatic cell growth during their survival shift from low to high metabolic-oxygen-rich sites and reinforces the metastatic events. This review highlighted the crucial role of oxygen and metabolites in metastatic progression and exemplified the role of metabolic rewiring and oxygen availability in cancer cell adaptation. Furthermore, we have also addressed potential applications of altered oxygen and metabolic networking with tumor type that could be a signature pattern to assess tumor growth and chemotherapeutics efficacy in managing cancer metastasis.																	1538-4047	1555-8576															10.1080/15384047.2021.1992233		OCT 2021					WOS:000711266000001	34696706

The molecular heterogeneity of TNBC and lack of high frequency driver mutations other than TP53 have hindered the development of new and effective therapies that significantly improve patient outcomes. miRNAs, global regulators of survival and proliferation pathways important in tumor development and maintenance, are becoming promising therapeutic agents. We performed miRNA-profiling studies in different TNBC subtypes to identify miRNAs that significantly contribute to disease progression. We found that miR-34a was lost in TNBC, specifically within mesenchymal and mesenchymal stem cell-like subtypes, whereas expression of miR-34a targets was significantly enriched. Furthermore, restoration of miR-34a in cell lines representing these subtypes inhibited proliferation and invasion, activated senescence, and promoted sensitivity to dasatinib by targeting the proto-oncogene c-SRC. Notably, SRC depletion in TNBC cell lines phenocopied the effects of miR-34a reintroduction, whereas SRC overexpression rescued the antitumorigenic properties mediated by miR-34a. miR-34a levels also increased when cells were treated with c-SRC inhibitors, suggesting a negative feedback exists between miR-34a and c-SRC. Moreover, miR-34a administration significantly delayed tumor growth of subcutaneously and orthotopically implanted tumors in nude mice, and was accompanied by cSRC downregulation. Finally, we found that miR-34a and SRC levels were inversely correlated in human tumor specimens. Together, our results demonstrate that miR-34a exerts potent antitumorigenic effects in vitro and in vivo and suggests that miR-34a replacement therapy, which is currently being tested in human clinical trials, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC.

We noted that genes upregulated in this subtype are also prominently expressed by stromal cells, suggesting that SSM transcripts could derive from stromal rather than epithelial cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CRC expression data from patient-derived xenografts, where mouse stroma supports human cancer cells. Species-specific expression analysis showed that the mRNA levels of SSM genes were mostly due to stromal expression. Transcriptional signatures built to specifically report the abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leukocytes or endothelial cells all had significantly higher expression in human CRC samples of the SSM subtype. High expression of the CAF signature was associated with poor prognosis in untreated CRC, and joint high expression of the stromal signatures predicted resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer. These data show that the distinctive transcriptional and clinical features of the SSM subtype can be ascribed to its particularly abundant stromal component.

Based on global expression analysis, GBM can be classified into distinct subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal. The signatures of these different tumor subtypes may reflect the phenotypes of cells giving rise to them. However, the experimental evidence connecting any specific subtype of GBM to particular cells of origin is lacking. In addition, it is unclear how different genetic alterations interact with cells of origin in determining tumor heterogeneity. This issue cannot be addressed by studying end-stage human tumors. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this issue, we used retroviruses to deliver transforming genetic lesions to glial progenitors in adult mouse brain. We compared the resulting tumors to human GBM. We found that different initiating genetic lesions gave rise to tumors with different growth rates. However all mouse tumors closely resembled the human Proneural GBM. Comparative analysis of these mouse tumors allowed us to identify a set of genes whose expression in humans with Proneural GBM correlates with survival. Conclusions/Significance: This study offers insights into the relationship between adult glial progenitors and Proneural GBM, and allows us to identify molecular alterations that lead to more aggressive tumor growth. In addition, we present a new preclinical model that can be used to test treatments directed at a specific type of GBM in future studies.

Considering the high heterogeneity of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), identification of bone marrow adipocyte progenitors (BMAPs) within heterogeneous BMSCs may provide better cellular models for research regarding osteoporosis development and therapy. However, currently there is no efficient method or specific surface makers that are available for BMAPs isolation. In the current study, we developed a novel BMAPs isolation method based on silica microbeads incubation and subsequent centrifugation in ficoll-paque. The Sca-1(+)CD73(-)CD90(-)CD105(+) subpopulation selected by this method exhibited significantly stronger adipogenic potential than nonselected BMSCs in vitro and could homogeneously differentiate into mature adipocytes within 4 days. Moreover, these cells also highly expressed a series of adipogenesis-related genes even before differentiation. After long-term culture, however, BMAPs would gradually lose high adipogenic ability, but sorting CD105(+) cells from BMAPs in later passages was able to retrieve the highly adipogenic subpopulation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BMAPs subpopulation could be effectively isolated from heterogeneous BMSCs by a special silica microbeads incubation method and re-enriched by sorting CD105(+) cells. These findings offer convenient and repeatable approaches to obtain pure BMAPs for research regarding pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutics development of osteoporosis.

Rebecca			TCOF1 upregulation in triple-negative breast cancer promotes stemness and tumour growth and correlates with poor prognosis	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER												Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with poor prognosis. By performing multiomic profiling, we recently uncovered super-enhancer heterogeneity between breast cancer subtypes. Our data also revealed TCOF1 as a putative TNBC-specific super-enhancer-regulated gene. TCOF1 plays a critical role in craniofacial development but its function in cancer remains unclear. Methods Overall survival and multivariant Cox regression analyses were conducted using the METABRIC data set. The effect of TCOF1 knockout on TNBC growth and stemness was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo assays. RNA-seq and rescue experiments were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results TCOF1 is frequently upregulated in TNBC and its elevated expression correlates with shorter overall survival. TCOF1 depletion significantly inhibits the growth and stemness of basal-like TNBC, but not of mesenchymal-like cells, highlighting the distinct molecular dependency in different TNBC subgroups. RNA-seq uncovers several stem cell molecules regulated by TCOF1. We further demonstrate that KIT is a downstream effector of TCOF1 in mediating TNBC stemness. TCOF1 expression in TNBC is regulated by the predicted super-enhancer. Conclusions TCOF1 depletion potently attenuates the growth and stemness of basal-like TNBC. Expression of TCOF1 may serve as a TNBC prognostic marker and a therapeutic target.				; Lau, C.

In this study, we report the significance of an elevation of the stem cell regulator SOX9 in bacteria-infected human gastritis and cancer samples, paralleling increased levels of TNF alpha. SOX9 elevation was more intense in specimens containing the pathogenically significant cagA+ strains of H. pylori. Notably, we found that SOX9 was required for bacteria-induced gastric cancer cell proliferation, increased levels of beta-catenin, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties. Analysis of three large clinical cohorts revealed elevated SOX9 levels in gastric cancer with advanced tumor stage and poor patient survival. Functionally, SOX9 silencing in gastric cancer cells enhanced apoptosis and senescence, concomitantly with a blockade to self-renewal and tumor-initiating capability. Paralleling these effects, we also found SOX9 to mediate cisplatin chemoresistance associated with reduced disease-free survival. Mechanistic interactions between SOX9 and b-catenin expression suggested the existence of a regulatory role for SOX9 targeting the WNT canonical pathway. Taken together, our findings establish the significance of SOX9 in gastric cancer pathobiology and heterogeneity, with implications for targeting WNT-SOX9 signaling as a rational therapeutic strategy.

To develop a method for the rapid isolation of rat RPE cells with high yield and maintain its epithelial state in modified culture system. Methods. The eyeballs were incubated with dispase. The retina was isolated with RPE attached and cut into several pieces. Following a brief incubation in growth medium, large RPE sheets can be harvested rapidly. RPE cells were divided into four groups and cultured for several weeks, that is, (1) in cell culture dishes with 10% FBS containing medium (CC dish-FBS), (2) in petri dishes with 10% FBS containing medium (Petri dish-FBS), (3) in cell culture dishes with N2 and B27 containing medium (CC dish-N2B27), and (4) in petri dishes with N2 and B27 containing medium (Petri dish-N2B27). Morphological and biological characteristics were investigated using light microscopy, Q-PCR, and western blot. Results. The retina would curl inwardly during the growth medium incubation period, releasing RPE sheets in the medium. Compared with low density group (5,000 cells/cm(2)), RPE cells plated at high density (15,000 cells/cm(2)) can maintain RPE morphology for a more extended period. Meanwhile, plating RPE cells at low density significantly reduced the expression of RPE cell type-specific genes (RPE65, CRALBP, and bestrophin) and increased the expression of EMT-related genes (N-cadherin, fibronectin, and alpha-SMA), in comparison with the samples from the high density group. The petri dish culture condition reduced cell adhesion and thus inhibited RPE cell proliferation. As compared with other culture conditions, RPE cells in the petri dish-N2B27 condition could maintain RPE phenotype with increased expression of RPE-specific genes and decreased expression of EMT-related genes. The AKT/mTOR pathway was also decreased in petri dish-N2B27 condition. Conclusion. The current study provided an alternative method for easy isolation of RPE cells with high yield and maintenance of its epithelial morphology in the petri dish-N2B27 condition.

Important aspects for disease control remain unresolved, including unclear pathogenesis, high heterogeneity and relapse resistance after chemotherapy. Therefore, further research on molecular mechanisms involved in cancer progression are needed to find new targets for disease management. The Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of transcriptional regulators controlling several basic cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and migration. They have been shown to play a role in various cancer-relevant processes, in a context-dependent way. Methods To investigate a possible role of KLF family members as prognostic biomarkers, we carried out a bioinformatic meta-analysis of ovarian transcriptome datasets in different cohorts of late-stage HGSOC patients. In vitro cellular models of HGSOC were used for functional studies exploring the role of KLF7 in disease development and progression. Finally, molecular modelling and virtual screening were performed to identify putative KLF7 inhibitors. Results Bioinformatic analysis highlighted KLF7 as the most significant prognostic gene, among the 17 family members. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified KLF7 as an unfavourable prognostic marker for overall survival in late-stage TCGA-OV and GSE26712 HGSOC cohorts. Functional in vitro studies demonstrated that KLF7 can play a role as oncogene, driving tumour growth and dissemination. Mechanistic targets of KLF7 included genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal characteristics of cancer stem cells. Finally, in silico analysis provided reliable information for drug-target interaction prediction. Conclusions Results from the present study provide the first evidence for an oncogenic role of KLF7 in HGSOC, suggesting it as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

At fetal day 10, they matured into fetal macrophages, showed intense immunoreactivity to RM-1, developed lysosomal granules, endocytic vesicles or vacuoles, and extended fine cytoplasmic processes. By the rosetting assay with IgG-coated sheep erythrocyte antibody (IgG-EA), both the immature and mature fetal macrophages showed rosette formation and phagocytosis of IgG-EA. but they were negative for peroxidase (PO) reaction. At fetal day 11, fetal macrophages were observed in the mesenchymal layer of the yolk sacs. In the yolk sacs. no promonocytes or monocytes were observed, although there was a very minor population (less than 1%) of immature myeloid cells containing a few small PO-positive cytoplasmic granules from fetal day 11 on. After combination of the vitelline vessels to the embryonic cardiovascular system. fetal macrophages appeared in embryonic rat tissues. By [H-3]thymidine autoradiography, yolk sac macrophages were demonstrated to possess a marked proliferative potential. These results suggest that fetal macrophages in the yolk sac differentiate from haematopoietic stem cells without passing through the promonocyte or monocyte stage, proliferate actively, and colonize the embryonic rat tissues.																	0040-8166					JUN	1993	25	3					351	362		10.1016/0040-8166(93)90077-X							WOS:A1993LG30300005	8332987

Metaplastic breast carcinoma: Current therapeutic approaches and novel targeted therapies	BREAST JOURNAL												Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare subtype of invasive breast cancer consisting of various combinations of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Its aggressive growth pattern combined with its histological heterogeneity account for MBC's characteristic resistance to systemic therapies, which subsequently leads to increased risk of recurrence and breast cancer mortality compared with other invasive mammary carcinomas. The aim of this review is to discuss the current therapeutic approaches, both in loco-regional as well as in systemic management of MBC. With the accumulation of knowledge from histopathologic assessment and the increasing identification of underlying molecular aberrations, emerging, novel targeted therapies will enable physicians to implement a more individualized and efficacious therapeutic strategy, leading hopefully to an improvement in the poor prognosis of MBC.																	1075-122X	1524-4741				NOV	2019	25	6					1192	1197		10.1111/tbj.13416							WOS:000492821600020	31250492

ONKOLOGIE												Background: Salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are known for their specific heterogeneity and ambiguous outcome for the affected patients. The LKB1 and SMAD4 genes are pivotal components of important signaling pathways, including AMPK and TGF-beta. To our knowledge, no study has reported an association between the expression levels of these genes in SGTs. The expression levels of LKB1 and SMAD4 were evaluated to clarify their possible crosstalk in SGTs. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 fresh tissue specimens were obtained from patients with SGTs, including pleomorphic adenoma (PA), Warthin's tumor (WT), intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CexPA), as well as 8 normal samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for all samples with specific primers. Results: Data were analyzed using statistical methods. PA, WT, MEC, and SDC showed a significant decrease in LKB1 levels, but the gene was upregulated in CexPA. SMAD4 was overexpressed in all samples. Conclusion: The results suggest a possible link between downregulation of LKB1 and overexpression of SMAD4 in SGTs. LKB1 depletion leads to upregulation of SMAD4, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. Therefore, LKB1 and SMAD4 could be key players in inducing tumor heterogeneity in SGTs.				kadivar, Mehdi/Q-8377-2017	kadivar, Mehdi/0000-0002-4317-8138												0378-584X					DEC	2012	35	12					770	774		10.1159/000345131							WOS:000312469400007	23207623

Expanded Genomic Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients to Assess Biomarker Status and Biology Over Time (CALGB 40502 and CALGB 40503, Alliance)	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH												Purpose: We profiled circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to study the biology of blood-borne metastasis and to monitor biomarker status in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Methods: CTCs were isolated from 105 patients with MBC using EPCAM-based immunomagnetic enrichment and fluorescence-activated cells sorting (IE/FACS), 28 of whom had serial CTC analysis (74 samples, 25 time points). CTCs were subjected to microfluidic-based multiplex QPCR array of 64 cancer-related genes (n = 151) and genome-wide copy-number analysis by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH; n = 49). Results: Combined transcriptional and genomic profiling showed that CTCs were 26% ESR1(-)ERBB2(-), 48% ESR1(+)ERBB2(-), and 27% ERBB2(+). Serial testing showed that ERBB2 status was more stable over time compared with ESR1 and proliferation (MKI67) status. While cell-to-cell heterogeneity was observed at the single-cell level, with increasingly stable expression in larger pools, patient-specific CTC expression fingerprints were also observed. CTC copy-number profiles clustered into three groups based on the extent of genomic aberrations and the presence of large chromosomal imbalances. Comparative analysis showed discordance in ESR1/ER (27%) and ERBB2/HER2 (23%) status between CTCs and matched primary tumors. CTCs in 65% of the patients were considered to have low proliferation potential. Patients who harbored CTCs with high proliferation (MKI67) status had significantly reduced progression-free survival (P = 0.0011) and overall survival (P = 0.0095) compared with patients with low proliferative CTCs. Conclusions: We demonstrate an approach for complete isolation of EPCAM-positive CTCs and downstream comprehensive transcriptional/genomic characterization to examine the biology and assess breast cancer biomarkers in these cells over time. 2018 AACR.

A single day of TGF-beta 1 exposure activates chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation pathways in bone marrow-derived stromal cells	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												Virtually all bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) chondrogenic induction cultures include greater than 2 weeks exposure to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but fail to generate cartilage-like tissue suitable for joint repair. Herein we used a micro-pellet model (5x10(3) BMSC each) to determine the duration of TGF-beta 1 exposure required to initiate differentiation machinery, and to characterize the role of intrinsic programming. We found that a single day of TGF-beta 1 exposure was sufficient to trigger BMSC chondrogenic differentiation and tissue formation, similar to 21 days of TGF-beta 1 exposure. Despite cessation of TGF-beta 1 exposure following 24hours, intrinsic programming mediated further chondrogenic and hypertrophic BMSC differentiation. These important behaviors are obfuscated by diffusion gradients and heterogeneity in commonly used macro-pellet models (2x10(5) BMSC each). Use of more homogenous micro-pellet models will enable identification of the critical differentiation cues required, likely in the first 24-hours, to generate high quality cartilage-like tissue from BMSC. Futrega et al. challenge the long established chondrogenic differentiation protocol used to induce bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) differentiation which presumes the need for more than 2 weeks of continuous TGF-beta 1 exposure. Using a micro-pellet model, they show that BMSC differentiation is triggered by a single day of TGF-beta 1 exposure.

On such dataset, immunohistochemical profiles, based on expression of a restricted panel of gene classifiers, were integrated by machine learning approach to generate a glioblastoma transcriptional signature based on protein quantification that allowed to efficiently assign transcriptional subgroups to an extended cohort. Correlations with both histopathological features and clinical outcome have been also performed. Glioblastomas (GBM) can be classified into three major transcriptional subgroups (proneural, mesenchymal, classical), underlying different molecular alterations, prognosis, and response to therapy. However, transcriptional analysis is not routinely feasible and assessment of a simplified method for glioblastoma subclassification is required. We propose an integrated molecular and immunohistochemical approach aimed at identifying GBM subtypes in routine paraffin-embedded material. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed on representative samples (n = 51) by means of a "glioblastoma transcriptional subtypes (GliTS) redux" custom gene signature including a restricted number (n = 90) of upregulated genes validated on the TCGA dataset. With this dataset, immunohistochemical profiles, based on expression of a restricted panel of gene classifiers, were integrated by a machine-learning approach to generate a GliTS based on protein quantification that allowed an efficient GliTS assignment when applied to an extended cohort (n = 197). GliTS redux maintained high levels of correspondence with the original GliTS classification using the TCGA dataset. The machine-learning approach designed an immunohistochemical (IHC)-based classification, whose concordance was 79.5% with the transcriptional- based classification, and reached 90% for the mesenchymal subgroup. Distribution and survival of GliTS were in line with reported data, with the mesenchymal subgroup given the worst prognosis. Notably, the algorithm allowed the identification of cases with comparable probability to be assigned to different GliTS, thus falling within overlapping regions and reflecting an extreme heterogeneous phenotype that mirrors the underlying genetic and biological tumor heterogeneity. Indeed, while mesenchymal and classical subgroups were well segregated, the proneural types frequently showed a mixed proneural/classical phenotype, predicted as proneural by the algorithm, but with comparable probability of being assigned to the classical subtype. These cases, characterized by concomitant high expression of EGFR and proneural biomarkers, showed lower survival. Collectively, these data indicate that a restricted panel of highly sensitive immunohistochemical markers can efficiently predict GliTS with high accuracy and significant association with different clinical outcomes.

The RUNX2 transcription factor is upregulated in early stage luminal BC. However, the precise mechanism by which RUNX2 regulates an oncogenic phenotype in luminal BCs remains an enigma. We show that RUNX2 is predictive of poor overall survival in BC patients. RUNX2 associated with the TAZ transcriptional co-activator to promote a tumorigenic phenotype that was inhibited by knockdown of TAZ. RUNX2 increased endogenous TAZ translocation to the nucleus, which was prevented by inhibiting RUNX2. RUNX2/TAZ interaction was associated with ectodomain shedding of an oncogenic soluble E-Cadherin fragment (sE-Cad), which is known to cooperate with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/ErbB2) to increase BC growth. Neutralizing E-Cadherin antibodies or TAZ knockdown reduced the levels of sE-Cad in RUNX2-expressing BC cells and inhibited tumorsphere formation. RUNX2 expression also increased HER2-mediated tumorsphere size, which was reduced after treatment with the HER2-targeting agents Herceptin and lapatinib. These data support a novel role for RUNX2 in promoting an oncogenic phenotype in luminal BC in the context of TAZ, sE-Cad, and HER2. Using this signaling pathway to monitor BC cell oncogenic activity will accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic modalities to treat BC patients.

Numerous studies have uncovered an aberrant expression of Wnt in cancer and its association with multiple oncogenic processes, such as cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasiveness. Most previous studies mainly focused on the canonical branch of Wnt signaling pathway, i.e., Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, as the most recently described branch of Wnt signaling, was much less investigated in oncology research. In this study, we thoroughly characterized the activity of the Wnt/PCP regulation pathway in low-grade glioma (LGG) patients. Subtyping based on the expression pattern of the Wnt/PCP regulation pathway revealed three (C1-C3) subgroups with significant survival differences. Each group displayed distinct genomic characteristics. For instance, C1 was enriched with capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) truncating mutations and 1p19q codel. C2 was characterized with tumor protein p53 (TP53) and ATRX chromatin remodeler (ATRX) inactivating mutations but depletion of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. C3 showed elevated malignancy reflected from several oncogenic characteristics, such as tumor heterogeneity and cell stemness, and demonstrated the worst survival outcome. In addition, C3 showed elevated macrophage segregation via induction of cytokines that are able to enhance the permeability of the brain-blood barrier (BBB). Lastly, we developed a prognostic model based on the risk score system. Validation indicated that our model can independently predict the prognosis of LGG patients.

For this reason self-assembled monolayers (SAM), varying in chain length, are used; they are highly effective in preventing protein adsorption or cell adhesion. In addition, a simple and cost-effective technique to design nanopatterns of various sizes and distances, the so-called nanosphere lithography (NSL), is discussed, which allows the control of cell adhesion and growth depending on the feature dimensions. Combining both techniques results in highly selective nanostructured surfaces, showing that single proteins selectively adsorb on activated nanopatterns. Additionally, adhesion and growth of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) is strongly affected by the nanostructure dimensions, and it is proven that fibronectin (FN) matrix formation of these cells is influenced, too. Moreover, the FN fibrils are linked to the hexagonally close-packed nanopatterns. As a result, the system presented here can be applied in tissue engineering and implant design due to the fact that the nanopattern dimensions give rise to further modifications and allow the introduction of chemical heterogeneity to guide stem cell differentiation in the future.

Several cellular populations have been implicated, including bone marrow-derived circulating fibrocytes, endothelial cells, resident fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and recently, perivascular cells called pericytes. We previously demonstrated pericyte functional heterogeneity in skeletal muscle. Whether pericyte subtypes are present in other tissues and whether a specific pericyte subset contributes to organ fibrosis are unknown. Methods: Here, we report the presence of two pericyte subtypes, type-1 (Nestin-GFP-/NG2-DsRed+) and type-2 (Nestin-GFP+/NG2-DsRed+), surrounding blood vessels in lungs, kidneys, heart, spinal cord, and brain. Using Nestin-GFP/NG2-DsRed transgenic mice, we induced pulmonary, renal, cardiac, spinal cord, and cortical injuries to investigate the contributions of pericyte subtypes to fibrous tissue formation in vivo. Results: A fraction of the lung's collagen-producing cells corresponds to type-1 pericytes and kidney and heart pericytes do not produce collagen in pathological fibrosis. Note that type-1, but not type-2, pericytes increase and accumulate near the fibrotic tissue in all organs analyzed. Surprisingly, after CNS injury, type-1 pericytes differ from scar-forming PDGFR beta + cells. Conclusions: Pericyte subpopulations respond differentially to tissue injury, and the production of collagen by type-1 pericytes is organ-dependent. Characterization of the mechanisms underlying scar formation generates cellular targets for future anti-fibrotic therapeutics.

Variables Affecting Fusion Rates in the Rat Posterolateral Spinal Fusion Model with Autogenic/Allogenic Bone Grafts: A Meta-analysis	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING												The rat posterolateral spinal fusion model with autogenic/allogenic bone graft (rat PFABG) has been increasingly utilized as an experimental model to assess the efficacy of novel fusion treatments. The objective of this study was to investigate the reliability of the rat PFABG model and examine the effects of different variables on spinal fusion. A web-based literature search from January, 1970 to September, 2015, yielded 26 studies, which included 40 rat PFABG control groups and 449 rats. Data regarding age, weight, sex, and strain of rats, graft volume, graft type, decorticated levels, surgical approach, institution, the number of control rats, fusion rate, methods of fusion assessment, and timing of fusion assessment were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome variable of interest was fusion rate, as evaluated by manual palpation. Fusion rates varied widely, from 0 to 96%. The calculated overall fusion rate was 46.1% with an I (2) value of 62.4, which indicated moderate heterogeneity. Weight > 300 g, age > 14 weeks, male rat, Sprague-Dawley strain, and autogenic coccyx grafts increased fusion rates with statistical significance. Additionally, an assessment time-point aeyen8 weeks had a trend towards statistical significance (p = 0.070). Multi-regression analysis demonstrated that timing of assessment and age as continuous variables, as well as sex as a categorical variable, can predict the fusion rate with R (2) = 0.82. In an inter-institution reliability analysis, the pooled overall fusion rate was 50.0% [44.8, 55.3%], with statistically significant differences among fusion outcomes at different institutions (p < 0.001 and I (2) of 72.2). Due to the heterogeneity of fusion outcomes, the reliability of the rat PFABG model was relatively limited. However, selection of adequate variables can optimize its use as a control group in studies evaluating the efficacy of novel fusion therapies.

Report of 4 cases.	JOURNAL DE RADIOLOGIE												Goal. This study concerns the new anatomo-pathologic semantics of the ancient gastric leiomyoblastoma that become gastric stromal tumors (GST) and identified as stemming of "pace-maker" cells of Cajal related to the immunohistochemical characterization of the phenotype. Material and methods. We limited the study to the mesenchymatous tumors to "pacemaker' cells. For this purpose, we report four documented observations of gastric stromal tumors correlated to the histology and to the immunohistochemical study. Results, Although some signs are often described (exogastric development, heterogeneity with cystic and necrotic component, predominating peripheral enhancement..), radiological aspects of these tumors are not specific because, analogues to the other mesenchymal tumors (leiomyoma or schwannoma). The topographic diagnosis is difficult, realized by echoendoscopy, CT scan and MRI. The irregularity of contours evokes the malignancy as hemoperitoneum. GST do not show lymphophilic behavior that differentiates them from the adenocarcinomas and gastric lymphomas. The surgical treatment is the best treatment, allowing the immuno-histological diagnosis of certainty from the complete operative specimen. Conclusion. Some tumors are difficult in classifying despite classic histology necessitating immuno-histochimical tests for the identification of muscular, nervous, autonomous nervous system flexion of mesenchymatous tumors with epithelioid or spindle cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Then a radio-clinical follow-up is therefore indicated: the evolution is the alone real marker of malignancy.

FGFR2IIIb signaling regulates thymic epithelial differentiation	DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS												Heterogeneous epithelial populations comprising the thymic environment influence early and late stages of T-cell development. The processes that regulate the differentiation of thymic epithelium and that are responsible for this heterogeneity are not well understood, although mesenchymal/epithelial interactions are clearly involved. Here, we show that targeted expression by thymocytes of an fibroblast growth factor receptor-2IIIb (FGFR2IIIb) ligand, FGF10, profoundly alters the differentiation and function of thymic epithelium (TE). Reconstitution of irradiated lckFGF10 mice with normal bone marrow restores normal thymic organization and function, while wild-type mice reconstituted with lckFGF10 bone marrow recapitulates some of the thymic alterations seen in lckFGF10 mice. We also demonstrate that interference with FGFR2IIIb signaling in the thymus with a soluble FGFR2IIIb dominant-negative fusion protein leads to precocious reductions in thymic size and cellularity that resemble age-related thymic involution. These findings indicate that TE compartments are dynamically maintained and that FGF signals are involved in this process. Developmental Dynamics 236:3459-3471, 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The Cellular Organization of the Mammary Gland: Insights From Microscopy	JOURNAL OF MAMMARY GLAND BIOLOGY AND NEOPLASIA												Despite rapid advances in our knowledge of the cellular heterogeneity and molecular regulation of the mammary gland, how these relate to 3D cellular organization remains unclear. In addition to hormonal regulation, mammary gland development and function is directed by para- and juxtacrine signaling among diverse cell-types, particularly the immune and mesenchymal populations. Precise mapping of the cellular landscape of the breast will help to decipher this complex coordination. Imaging of thin tissue sections has provided foundational information about cell positioning in the mammary gland and now technological advances in tissue clearing and subcellular-resolution 3D imaging are painting a more complete picture. In particular, confocal, light-sheet and multiphoton microscopy applied to intact tissue can fully capture cell morphology, position and interactions, and have the power to identify spatially rare events. This review will summarize our current understanding of mammary gland cellular organization as revealed by microscopy. We focus on the mouse mammary gland and cover a broad range of immune and stromal cell types at major developmental stages and give insights into important tissue niches and cellular interactions.

The present study using 58 immortalized stromal lines from different hematopoietic sites was conducted to verify whether this hypothesis also held true for murine stroma, principal components analysis performed using cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins allowed the segregation of five factors explaining more than 70% of the variance. Factor I, including osteopontin and vimentin, and factor II, laminins and fibronectins, were representative of the mesenchyme. The remaining three factors mere representative of vascular smooth muscle: factor III, including alpha SM actin, SM alpha actinin, SM22 alpha, EDa(+) fibronectin, and thrombospondin-1; factor IV, metavinculin and h-caldesmon; and factor V, smooth muscle myosin SM1 and desmin. All lines expressed factors I and II; 53 lines expressed factor III, 35 lines expressed factor IV; and II lines expressed factor V. A second principal components analysis including membrane antigens indicated the cosegregration of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 with osteopontin and that of Ly6A/E with vimentin, whereas CD34 and Thy-1 appeared to be independent factors. The heterogeneity of vascular smooth muscle markers expression suggests that harmonious maintenance of hematopoiesis depends on the cooperation between different stromal cell clones.

However, it remains unknown whether aspirin influences other immune cells during bone formation. In the present study, we investigated whether ASA treatment influenced macrophage activation during the LPS inducement. We found that ASA could downregulate the expressions of iNOS and TNF-alpha both in mouse peritoneum macrophages and RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS via the I kappa K/I kappa B/NF-kappa B pathway and a COX2/PGE(2)/EP2/NF-kappa B feedback loop, without affecting the expressions of FIZZ/YM-1/ARG1 induced by IL-4. Furthermore, we created a rat mandibular bone defect model and showed that ASA treatment improved bone regeneration by inhibiting LPS-induced macrophage activation in the early stages of inflammation. Taken together, our results indicated that ASA treatment was a feasible strategy for improving bone regeneration, particularly in inflammatory conditions.

This study develops thermoresponsive hydrogels with controllable stiffness to generate mechanically primed cells with intact mechanical memory for augmented wound healing. No significant cellular property alteration of the fibroblasts primed on thermo-responsive hydrogels with varied stiffness has been observed through thermoresponsive harvesting. When reseeding the harvested cells for further evaluation, softer hydrogels are proven to better sustain the mechanical priming effects compared to rigid tissue culture plate, which indicates that both the stiffness-controlled substrate and thermoresponsive harvesting are required to sustain cellular mechanical memory between passages. Moreover, epigenetics analysis reveals that thermoresponsive harvesting could reduce the rearrangement and loss of chromatin proteins compared to that of trypsinization. In vivo wound healing using mechanically primed fibroblasts shows featured epithelium and sebaceous glands, which indicates augmented skin recovery compared with trypsinized fibroblasts. Thus, the thermoresponsive hydrogel-based cell harvesting system offers a powerful tool to investigate mechanobiology between cell passages and produces abundant cells with tailored mechanical priming properties for cell-based applications.

Hypoxia Induces an Undifferentiated Phenotype of Oral Keratinocytes in vitro	CELLS TISSUES ORGANS												The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hypoxia on the proliferating potential and phenotype of primary human oral keratinocytes cultured at ambient oxygen tension (20%) or at different levels of hypoxia (2 and 0.5% O-2). The effects of oxygen tensions on cellular metabolic activity, cell proliferation, clonogenicity and proliferation heterogeneity were measured. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by a fluorescent-activated cell sorter, and p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in the G(0)/G(1) phase was also concomitantly quantitated. The expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins were examined by immunoblotting, and the cellular senescence was assessed by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining. Basal and suprabasal keratinocyte phenotypes were determined by the expression levels of 14-3-3 sigma, p75(NTR) and alpha 6 integrin. Despite having a lower metabolism, the proliferation rate and clonogenic potential were remarkably enhanced in hypoxic cells. The significantly higher percentage of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase under hypoxia and the expression patterns of cell cycle regulatory proteins in hypoxic cells were indicative of a state of cell cycle arrest in hypoxia. Furthermore, a decrease in the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p16(INK4A) and fewer beta-galactosidase-positive cells suggested a quiescent phenotype rather than a senescent one in hypoxic cells. Compared with normoxic cells, the differential expression patterns of keratinocyte phenotypic markers suggest that hypoxic cells that generate minimal reactive oxygen species, suppress the mammalian target of rapamycin activity and express hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha favor a basal cell phenotype. Thus, regardless of the predisposition to the state of cell cycle arrest, hypoxic conditions can maintain oral keratinocytes in vitro in an undifferentiated and quiescent state. (C) 2015 S.

Cytokine networking between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) maintains the self-renewing subpopulation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that mediate tumor heterogeneity, resistance and recurrence. Immunotherapy of those factors combined with targeted therapy or chemoagents may advantage TNBC treatment. Results: We found that the oncogene Multiple Copies in T-cell Malignancy 1 (MCT-1/MCTS1) expression is a new poor-prognosis marker in patients with aggressive breast cancers. Overexpressing MCT-1 perturbed the oncogenic breast epithelial acini morphogenesis and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinase activation in invasive TNBC cells, which were repressed after MCT-1 gene silencing. As mammary tumor progression was promoted by oncogenic MCT-1 activation, tumor-promoting M2 macrophages were enriched in TME, whereas M2 macrophages were decreased and tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages were increased as the tumor was repressed via MCT-1 knockdown. MCT-1 stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion that promoted monocytic THP-1 polarization into M2-like macrophages to increase TNBC cell invasiveness. In addition, MCT-1 elevated the soluble IL-6 receptor levels, and thus, IL-6R antibodies antagonized the effect of MCT-1 on promoting M2-like polarization and cancer cell invasion. Notably, MCT-1 increased the features of BCSCs, which were further advanced by IL-6 but prevented by tocilizumab, a humanized IL-6R antibody, thus MCT-1 knockdown and tocilizumab synergistically inhibited TNBC stemness. Tumor suppressor miR-34a was induced upon MCT-1 knockdown that inhibited IL-6R expression and activated M1 polarization. Conclusions: The MCT-1 pathway is a novel and promising therapeutic target for TNBC.

Despite of the evident importance, data regarding the cellular microenvironment remain unclear. Our objective was to explore the tissue microenvironment heterogeneity, transcripts, and pathways that are enriched in all phases of the menstrual cycle by analysing publicly deposited data derived from whole transcriptome microarrays of eutopic endometria of women with and without endometriosis. A meta-analysis of the transcriptome microarrays was performed using raw data available from a public database. Eligibility criteria included eutopic endometrium samples from women with endometriosis and healthy controls without any pathological condition reported the presence of an adequately reported normal menstrual phase, and samples containing both glandular and stromal components. Raw data were processed using a robust multiarray average method to provide background correction, normalisation, and summarisation. The batch effect was estimated by principal variant component analysis and removed using an empirical Bayes method. Cellular tissue heterogeneity was inferred using the xCell package. Differentially expressed genes were identified based on a 5% adjusted p value and a 2.0-fold change. Pathways were identified by functional enrichment based on the Molecular Signatures Database, a p value of < 5%, and an FDR q value of <= 25%. Genes that were more frequently found in pathways were identified using leading edge analysis. In a manner independent of cycle phase, the subpopulations of activated dendritic cells, CD4 T effector memory phenotype cells, eosinophils, macrophages M1, and natural killer T cells (NKT) were all higher in stage I-II endometriosis compared to those in healthy controls. The subpopulations of M2 macrophages and natural killer T cells were elevated in eutopic endometriums from women with stage III-IV endometriosis, and smooth muscle cells were always more prevalent in healthy eutopic endometriums. Among the differently expressed genes, FOS, FOSB, JUNB, and EGR1 were the most frequently mapped within the interaction networks, and this was independent of stage and cycle phase. The enriched pathways were directly related to immune surveillance, stem cell self-renewal, and epithelial mesenchymal transition. PI3K AKT mTOR, TGF signalling, and interferon alpha/gamma responses were enriched exclusively in stage III-IV endometriosis. The cellular microenvironments and immune cell profiles were different between eutopic endometriums from women with stage I-II and stage III-IV endometriosis, and these differences were independent of the hormonal milieu. Specifically, a pro-inflammatory profile was predominant in stage I-II endometriosis, and M1-M2 polarization into eutopic endometrium may be crucial for the progression of the disease. The higher prevalence of NKT cells in eutopic endometriums from women with endometriosis that was independent of cycle phase or staging suggested a sustained stress and/or damage to these eutopic endometriums. Based on this, the results of this meta-analysis are important for identifying challenges and opportunities for future research.

Here, we show that mutant beta-catenin can be transported via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and activate Wnt signalling pathway in the recipient cells. An integrative proteogenomic analysis identified the presence of mutated beta-catenin in EVs secreted by colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Follow-up experiments established that EVs released from LIM1215 CRC cells stimulated Wnt signalling pathway in the recipient cells with wild-type beta-catenin. SILAC-based quantitative proteomics analysis confirmed the transfer of mutant beta-catenin to the nucleus of the recipient cells. In vivo tracking of DiR-labelled EVs in mouse implanted with RKO CRC cells revealed its bio-distribution, confirmed the activation of Wnt signalling pathway in tumour cells and increased the tumour burden. Overall, for the first time, this study reveals that EVs can transfer mutant beta-catenin to the recipient cells and promote cancer progression.

Genetic association between WNT10B polymorphisms and obesity in a Belgian case-control population is restricted to males	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM												The Wnt pathway has been shown to play an important role in maintenance of stern cells and cell fate decisions in embryonic and adult stem cell populations. Activation of the Wilt pathway in mesenchymal stern cells and 3 T3-L1 cells inhibits adipogenesis and can lead to osteoblastogenesis. To evaluate the role of the Wnt pathway in adipogenesis and obesity further, we analysed the genetic association between polymorphisms in WNT10B, an activator of the Wnt pathway, and various obesity parameters in a Belgian population. Four tagSNPs that captured variation of ten SNPs (MAF > 5%) in a 15.2 kb region spanning the WNT10B gene and its 3' and 5' flanking regions were genotyped. Our population consisted of 1013 obese patients (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2); 468 males) and 531 lean healthy individuals (18.5 kg/m(2) <= BMI <= 24.9 kg/m(2): 194 males). We found a significant association with body mass index (BMI) for three of the genotyped tagSNPs (rs4018511, rs10875902, rs833841) in the male population as analysed by logistic regression. Allelic heterogeneity testing demonstrated that these associations all represent the same significant signal. Two of the three significant SNPs were also found to be associated with BMI and weight in the male population as analysed by linear regression. In conclusion, common variation in WNT10B was shown to be associated with BMI and weight in a case-control population of Belgian males. Nonetheless, replication of this result and elucidation of the molecular actions of WNT10B remain necessary. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, their clinical relevance is unclear. We ask whether GPCs contribute to disease progression and survival outcome in patients with glioma by analyzing gene expression profiles. Experimental Design: We tapped into public sources of GPC gene expression data and derived a gene signature distinguishing oligodendroglial from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) GPCs. By adapting a method in glioma biology, the Connectivity Map, we interrogated its strength of association in public clinical databases. We validated the top-ranking signaling pathways Wnt, Notch, and TGF beta, in GPCs and primary tumor specimens. Results: We observed that patients with better prognosis correlated with oligodendroglial GPC features and lower tumor grade, and this was independent of the current clinical indicator, 1p/19q status. Patients with better prognosis had proneural tumors whereas the poorly surviving cohort had mesenchymal tumors. In addition, oligodendroglial GPCs were more sensitive to Wnt and Notch inhibition whereas GBM GPCs responded to TGF beta R1 inhibition. Conclusions: We provide evidence that GPCs are clinically relevant. In addition, the more favorable prognosis of oligodendroglial tumors over GBM could be recapitulated transcriptomically at the GPC level, underscoring the relevance of this cellular model. Our gene signature detects molecular heterogeneity in oligodendroglial tumors that cannot be accounted for by the 1p/19q status alone, indicating that stem-like traits contribute to clinical status. Collectively, these data highlight the limitation of morphology-based histologic analyses in tumor classification, consequently impacting on treatment decisions. Clin Cancer Res; 18(15); 4122-35.

Here, we investigated the genetic alterations and transcriptomic transitions from precancerous adenoma to carcinoma. Design Whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed on matched adjacent normal tissues, multiregionally sampled adenomas at different stages and carcinomas from six patients with FAP and one patient with MUTYH-associated polyposis (n=56 exomes, n=56 genomes and n=8,757 single cells). Genomic alterations (including copy number alterations and somatic mutations), clonal architectures and transcriptome dynamics during adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis were comprehensively investigated. Results Genomic evolutionary analysis showed that adjacent lesions from the same patient with FAP can originate from the same cancer-primed cell. In addition, the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway was strongly repressed in adenomas and was then slightly alleviated in carcinomas. Cells from the 'normal' colon epithelium of patients with FAP already showed metabolic reprogramming compared with cells from the normal colon epithelium of patients with sporadic colorectal cancer. Conclusions The process described in the previously reported field cancerisation model also occurs in patients with FAP and can contribute to the formation of adjacent lesions in patients with FAP. Reprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism has already occurred at the precancerous adenoma stage. Our study provides an accurate picture of the genomic and transcriptomic landscapes during the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis, especially during the transition from adenoma to carcinoma.

First, we immunostained a multi-tumor tissue microarray and a breast cancer tissue microarray and demonstrated that WWP1 and ITCH are expressed in some of breast cancer cases. We then knocked down WWP1 or itch in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using shRNA and inoculated these cells and control cells into the left ventricle of athymic nude mice. Radiographs showed that mice given shWWP1 cells had more osteolytic lesions than mice given control MDA-MB-231 cells. Histologic analysis confirmed osteolysis and showed significantly increased tumor area in bone marrow of the mice. WWP1 knockdown did not affect cell growth, survival or osteoclastogenic potential, but markedly increased cell migration toward a CXCL12 gradient in vitro. Furthermore, WWP1 knockdown significantly reduced CXCL12-induced CXCR4 lysosomal trafficking and degradation. In contrast, itch knockdown had no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell bone metastasis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that WWP1 negatively regulates cell migration to CXCL12 by limiting CXCR4 degradation to promote breast cancer metastasis to bone and highlight the potential utility of WWP1 as a prognostic indicator for breast cancer bone metastasis.

LIPUS far-field exposimetry system for uniform stimulation of tissues in-vitro: development and validation with bovine intervertebral disc cells	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS												Therapeutic Low-intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) has been applied clinically for bone fracture healing and has been shown to stimulate extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in numerous soft tissues including intervertebral disc (IVD). In-vitro LIPUS testing systems have been developed and typically include polystyrene cell culture plates (CCP) placed directly on top of the ultrasound transducer in the acoustic near-field (NF). This configuration introduces several undesirable acoustic artifacts, making the establishment of dose-response relationships difficult, and is not relevant for targeting deep tissues such as the IVD, which may require far-field (FF) exposure from low frequency sources. The objective of this study was to design and validate an in-vitro LIPUS system for stimulating ECM synthesis in IVD-cells while mimicking attributes of a deep delivery system by delivering uniform, FF acoustic energy while minimizing reflections and standing waves within target wells, and unwanted temperature elevation within target samples. Acoustic field simulations and hydrophone measurements demonstrated that by directing LIPUS energy at 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 MHz operating frequency, with an acoustic standoff in the FF (125-350 mm), at 6-well CCP targets including an alginate ring spacer, uniform intensity distributions can be delivered. A custom FF LIPUS system was fabricated and demonstrated reduced acoustic intensity field heterogeneity within CCP-wells by up to 93% compared to common NF configurations. When bovine IVD cells were exposed to LIPUS (1.5 MHz, 200 mu s pulse, 1 kHz pulse frequency, and I-SPTA = 120 mW cm(-2)) using the FF system, sample heating was minimal (+0.81 degrees C) and collagen content was increased by 2.6-fold compared to the control and was equivalent to BMP-7 growth factor treatment. The results of this study demonstrate that FF LIPUS exposure increases collagen content in IVD cells and suggest that LIPUS is a potential noninvasive therapeutic for stimulating repair of tissues deep within the body such as the IVD.

Distinct Fibroblast Lineages Give Rise to NG2+Pericyte Populations in Mouse Skin Development and Repair	FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												We have examined the developmental origins of Ng2+ perivascular cell populations that adhere to the basement membrane of blood vessels, and their contribution to wound healing. Neural/glial antigen 2 (Ng2) labeled most perivascular cells (70-80%) in developing and adult mouse back skin, a higher proportion than expressed by other pericyte markers Tbx18, Nestin and Pdgfr beta. In adult mouse back skin Ng2+ perivascular cells could be categorized into 4 populations based on whether they expressed Pdgfr alpha and Pdgfr beta individually or in combination or were Pdgfr-negative. Lineage tracing demonstrated that although Ng2+ cells in embryonic and neonatal back skin contributed to multiple cell types they did not give rise to interfollicular fibroblasts within the dermis. Lineage tracing of distinct fibroblast populations during skin development showed that papillary fibroblasts (Lrig1+) gave rise to Ng2+ perivascular cells in the upper dermis, whilst Ng2+ perivascular cells in the lower dermis were primarily derived from reticular Dlk1+ fibroblasts. Following wounding of adult skin, Ng2+ dermal cells only give rise to Ng2+ blood vessel associated cells and did not contribute to other fibroblast lineages. The relative abundance of Ng2+ Pdgfr beta+ perivascular populations was comparable in wounded and non-wounded skin, indicating that perivascular heterogeneity was maintained during full thickness skin repair. In the wound bed Ng2+ perivascular populations were primarily derived from Lrig1+ papillary or Dlk1+ reticular fibroblast lineages, according to the location of the regenerating blood vessels. We conclude that Ng2+ perivascular cells represent a heterogeneous lineage restricted population that is primarily recruited from the papillary or reticular fibroblast lineages during tissue regeneration.

Factors like high attrition rates, huge investments, patients' heterogeneity, and diverse molecular subtypes have challenged the rapid development of anticancer drugs. Treatment with repurposing pleiotropic benzimidazole antihelminthics, like mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole has recently opened a new window, owing to their easy access, low cost as a generic drug, and long track record of safe use in the human population. This review highlights the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies of these drugs as a potent anticancer agent(s) conducted in the last two decades. Substantial preclinical studies, as well as limited clinical trials, suggest noteworthy anticancer potency of these pleiotropic benzimidazoles, particularly as potent microtubule disrupting, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic agents, inhibitors of the immune checkpoint, hypoxia-inducible factor, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness, and multidrug resistance protein 1, and inducers of apoptosis and M1 polarization. These anticancer effects are attributed to multiple action points, including intrinsic apoptosis, canonical Wnt/beta-catenin, JAK/STAT-3, JNK, MEK/ERK, and hedgehog signaling pathways. The effective anticancer properties of mebendazole, albendazole, and flubendazole either alone or synergistically with frontline drugs, warrant their validation through controlled clinical trials to use them as promising avenues to anticancer therapy.

We recently identified a subgroup of TNBC with loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN and five specific microRNAs that exhibits exceedingly poor clinical outcome and contains TP53 mutation, RB1 loss and high MYC and WNT signalling. Here, show that these PTEN-low/miRNA-low lesions cluster with BL1 TNBC. These tumors exhibited high RhoA signalling and were significantly stratified on the basis of PTEN-low/RhoA-signalling-high with hazard ratios (HRs) of 8.2 (P = 0.0009) and 4.87 (P = 0.033) in training and test cohorts, respectively. For BL2 TNBC, we identified AKT1 copy gain/high mRNA expression as surrogate for poor prognosis (HR = 3.9; P = 0.02 and HR = 6.1; P = 0.0032). In IM, programmed cell death 1 (PD1) was elevated and predictive of poor prognosis (HR = 5.3; P = 0.01 and HR = 3.5; P < 0.004). Additional alterations, albeit without prognostic power, characterized each subtype including high E2F2 and TGF beta signalling and CXCL8 expression in BL2, high IFN alpha and IFN gamma signalling and CTLA4 expression in IM, and high EGFR signalling in MSL, and may be targeted for therapy. This study identified PTEN-low/RhoA-signalling-high, and high AKT1 and PD1 expression as potent prognostications for BL1, BL2 and IM subtypes with survival differences of over 14, 2.75 and 10.5 years, respectively. This intrinsic heterogeneity could be exploited to prioritize patients for precision medicine.

The glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) is upregulated in malignant gliomas. Using a syngeneic intracranial glioma mouse model, we show that PDPN is highly expressed in a subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes within and adjacent to gliomas. The expression of PDPN in tumor-associated reactive astrocytes was confirmed by its colocalization with the astrocytic marker S100 beta and with connexin43, a major astrocytic gap junction protein. To determine whether the increase in PDPN is a general feature of gliosis, we used 2 mouse models in which astrogliosis was induced either by a needle injury or ischemia and observed similar upregulation of PDPN in reactive astrocytes in both models. Astrocytic PDPN was also found to be coexpressed with nestin, an intermediate filament marker for neural stem/progenitor cells. Our findings confirm that expression of PDPN is part of the normal host response to brain injury and gliomas, and suggest that it may be a novel cell surface marker for a specific population of reactive astrocytes in the vicinity of gliomas and nonneoplastic brain lesions. The findings also highlight the heterogeneity of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in reactive gliosis.

J	Piccolo, S; Cordenonsi, M; Dupont, S				Piccolo, Stefano; Cordenonsi, Michelangelo; Dupont, Sirio			Molecular Pathways: YAP and TAZ Take Center Stage in Organ Growth and Tumorigenesis	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH												The evolution of a solid tumor is fueled by genetic aberrations. Yet, the tumor environment often dominates over the effects of genetics: normal tissues have powerful tumor-suppressive properties that constantly tame or eliminate cells carrying transforming mutations. Critical elements of such a suppressive microenvironment are structural characteristics of normal cells and tissues, such as cell polarity, attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and epithelial organization. Once these tissue-level checkpoints have been overcome, tumor growth is enhanced by recruitment of stromal cells and remodeling of the ECM. Genetic inactivation in mouse models indicates the Hippo pathway as a fundamental inhibitor of organ growth during development and as a critical tumor suppressor in epithelial tissues, such as the liver, skin, and ovaries, and soft tissues. At the centerpiece of this pathway lie two related transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ, that promote tissue proliferation and the self-renewal of normal and cancer stem cells, and incite metastasis. Strikingly, YAP and TAZ are controlled by the same architectural features that first inhibit and then foster cancer growth, such as ECM elasticity, cell shape, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings open unexpected opportunities for the development of new cancer therapeutics targeting key YAP/TAZ regulatory inputs such as Wnt signaling, cytoskeletal contractility, G-protein-coupled receptors, or YAP/TAZ-regulated transcription.

Multiple signaling networks have been identified in the inductive interactions of odontogenesis at the early stage. Technical obstacles and heterogeneity of the dental follicle (DF), which is the origin of the majority of periodontal tissues, have hindered the clarification of the molecular blueprint in early periodontal tissue development. This has in turn hindered studies of new/effective periodontal regeneration therapy. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the gene expression profiles of DF at E17 (when DF cells are histologically recognized) and PN2 (the initiation of periodontal development). Methods: Gene expression profiles of DF at E17 and PN2 were assessed by the combined use of laser capture microdissection and microarray. Results: Comparative gene expression analysis of DF at E17 and PN2 during periodontal development revealed > 2-fold up-regulation and down-regulation of 2519 and 5060 genes, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of the selected genes revealed that the temporally changed genes were mostly enriched in GO terms relative to the vasculature system, and were sometimes linked to multiple processes. RT-qPCR was used to verify the microarray data. Conclusions: The delineation of the differential gene expressions between pre- and post-natal developmental stages of DF in vivo will increase the understanding of periodontal tissue development.

Interrogating the topological robustness of gene regulatory circuits by randomization	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												One of the most important roles of cells is performing their cellular tasks properly for survival. Cells usually achieve robust functionality, for example, cell-fate decision-making and signal transduction, through multiple layers of regulation involving many genes. Despite the combinatorial complexity of gene regulation, its quantitative behavior has been typically studied on the basis of experimentally verified core gene regulatory circuitry, composed of a small set of important elements. It is still unclear how such a core circuit operates in the presence of many other regulatory molecules and in a crowded and noisy cellular environment. Here we report a new computational method, named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE), for interrogating the robust dynamical behavior of a gene regulatory circuit even without accurate measurements of circuit kinetic parameters. RACIPE generates an ensemble of random kinetic models corresponding to a fixed circuit topology, and utilizes statistical tools to identify generic properties of the circuit. By applying RACIPE to simple toggle-switch-like motifs, we observed that the stable states of all models converge to experimentally observed gene state clusters even when the parameters are strongly perturbed. RACIPE was further applied to a proposed 22-gene network of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), from which we identified four experimentally observed gene states, including the states that are associated with two different types of hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal phenotypes. Our results suggest that dynamics of a gene circuit is mainly determined by its topology, not by detailed circuit parameters. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for circuit-based systems biology modeling. We anticipate RACIPE to be a powerful tool to predict and decode circuit design principles in an unbiased manner, and to quantitatively evaluate the robustness and heterogeneity of gene expression.

Comparison of three molecular assays for the detection and molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells in breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH												Introduction: Comparison studies between different analytical methodologies for circulating tumor cells (CTC) detection and molecular characterization are urgently needed, since standardization of assays is essential before their use in clinical practice. Methods: We compared three different CTC molecular assays. To avoid discrepancies due to pre-analytical errors we used the same cDNAs throughout our study. CTC were isolated using anti-EpCAM and anti-MUC1 coated magnetic beads from 2 x 5 ml of peripheral blood of 254 early and 51 metastatic breast cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals. The same cDNAs were analyzed by: a) singleplex RT-qPCR assay for CK-19; b) multiplex RT-qPCR for CK-19, HER-2, MAGE-A3, and PBGD; and c) a commercially available molecular assay (AdnaTest BreastCancer) for GA733-2, MUC-1, HER-2 and beta-actin. Results: In early breast cancer, CK-19 RT-qPCR, multiplex RT-qPCR and the AdnaTest, were positive for the presence of CTC in 14.2%, 22.8% and 16.5% subjects, respectively. The concordance between the AdnaTest and CK-19 RT-qPCR was 72.4% while between the AdnaTest and multiplex RT-qPCR was 64.6%. In patients with overt metastasis, CK-19 RT-qPCR, multiplex RT-qPCR and the AdnaTest were positive in 41.2%, 39.2% and 54.9% patients, respectively. The concordance between the AdnaTest and CK-19 RT-qPCR was 70.6% while between the AdnaTest and multiplex RT-qPCR was 68.6%. Conclusions: All CTC assays gave similar results in about 70% of cases. Better agreement was found in the metastatic setting, possibly explained by the higher tumor load in this group. Discordances could be attributed to the different gene transcripts used to evaluate CTC positivity. Our results indicate the importance of CTC heterogeneity for their detection by different analytical methodologies.

Combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors yields durable remission in PDX models of PIK3CA-mutated metaplastic breast cancers	JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY												Background Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare form of breast cancer characterized by an aggressive clinical presentation, with a poor response to standard chemotherapy. MBCs are typically triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), frequently with alterations to genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RTK-MAPK signaling pathways. The objective of this study was to determine the response to PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of MBCs with targetable alterations. Methods We compared survival between triple-negative MBCs and other histological subtypes, in a clinical cohort of 323 TNBC patients. PDX models were established from primary breast tumors classified as MBC. PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RTK-MAPK pathway alterations were detected by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and analyses of copy number alterations. Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RTK-MAPK signaling pathways was analyzed with reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA). PDXs carrying an activating mutation of PIK3CA and genomic changes to the RTK-MAPK signaling pathways were treated with a combination consisting of a PI3K inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor. Results In our clinical cohort, the patients with MBC had a worse prognosis than those with other histological subtypes. We established nine metaplastic TNBC PDXs. Three had a pathogenic mutation of PIK3CA and additional alterations to genes associated with RTK-MAPK signaling. The MBC PDXs expressed typical EMT and stem cell genes and were of the mesenchymal or mesenchymal stem-like TNBC subtypes. On histological analysis, MBC PDXs presented squamous or chondroid differentiation. RPPA analysis showed activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RTK-MAPK signaling pathways. In vivo, the combination of PI3K and MAPK inhibitors displayed marked antitumor activity in PDXs carrying genomic alterations of PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF, and FGFR4. Conclusion The treatment of metaplastic breast cancer PDXs by activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RTK-MAPK pathways at the genomic and protein levels with a combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors resulted in tumor regression in mutated models and may therefore be of interest for therapeutic purposes.

The method combines microscale-force measurement, bright-field microscopy based deformation analysis, and finite-element methods (FEM) to study the heterogeneity in bioengineered composite materials. The method was used to study silk fibroin protein based, donut-shaped scaffolds consisting of a shell (diameter 5 mm) and a core (diameter 2 mm) with a stiff-core or a soft-core configuration. The samples were based on our previously reported bioengineered brain tissue model. Step-wise images of sample deformation were recorded as the automated mechanical stage compressed the sample. The force compression curves were also recorded with a load cell. A MATLAB program was used to compare and match optically measured strain distribution with that found from the FEM simulations. Iterative processes are used to determine the values that best represent the elastic moduli of the shell and the core regions. The calculated moduli found from the composite models were not significantly different from the values measured separately for each material, demonstrating the efficacy of this new approach. In addition, the method successfully measured multiple distinct regions embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane block. These results demonstrated the feasibility of our method in the microheterogeneity characterization of biomimetic composite structures.

The heterogeneity that characterizes prostate tumors contributes to clinical challenges in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this malignancy. While localized prostate cancer can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy, metastatic disease to the lymph nodes and the bone requires aggressive treatment with androgen deprivation treatment (ADT). Unfortunately, this often eventually progresses to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Advanced prostate cancer treatment today involves 1st- and 2nd-line taxane chemotherapy and 2nd-generation antiandrogens. The process of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), during which epithelial cells lose their adhesions and their polarity, is a critical contributor to prostate cancer metastasis. In this article, we aim to integrate the current understanding of mechanisms dictating the dynamics of phenotypic EMT, with apoptosis outcomes in prostate tumors in response to antiandrogen and taxane chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced disease. Novel insights into the signaling mechanisms that target the functional interface between apoptosis and EMT will be considered in the context of potential clinical markers of tumor prognosis, as well as for effective therapeutic targeting of alpha- and beta-adrenergic signaling (by novel and existing chemotherapeutic agents and antiandrogens). Interfering with EMT and apoptosis simultaneously toward eradicating the tumor mass is of major significance in combating the lethal disease and increasing patient survival.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-59038-3; 978-3-030-59037-6				2020	1296						183	198		10.1007/978-3-030-59038-3_11	10.1007/978-3-030-59038-3						WOS:000680654800012	34185293					
J	Sato, S; Itamochi, H				Sato, Seiya; Itamochi, Hiroaki			Ovarian Cancer and Drug Resistance	CURRENT OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY REPORTS												Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most difficult cancer to cure in gynecological malignancy. Over 70 % of patients respond to chemotherapy initially, but the majority will relapse. Despite the emergence of a variety of cytotoxic anticancer agents and targeted therapy such as bevacizumab, control over the progression of EOC remains inadequate. Chemoresistance limits the survival of advanced cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Many drugs have been developed so far; however, the improvement in the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients is insufficient. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic change of DNA and multiple cellular pathways contribute to acquired drug resistance to chemotherapy. Identification of the molecular mechanisms associated with chemoresistance is a crucial step toward improving patient survival. A new treatment paradigm for overcoming the resistance of ovarian carcinoma is urgently needed.

STEM CELLS												The identification of nonhematopoietic progenitor cells in cord blood has spawned great interest in using cord blood cells for new indications in regenerative therapy. Many preclinical studies demonstrated improvement in reperfusion and markers of organ recovery using cord blood-derived cells in a range of animal models. Initial results heralded increasing clinical interest regarding the use of cord blood for regenerative therapy. Initial clinical studies were largely uncontrolled feasibility studies that were case series and reported on small numbers of patients. The emergence of controlled studies has been slower, although multiple controlled studies have been conducted in patients with cerebral palsy and type I diabetes. Heterogeneity in the cellular product, patients, study design, and the timing of outcome measurements remains barriers to meta-analysis and a clearer understanding of efficacy. Controlled studies of modest size have been reported for a range of additional conditions. The conduct of controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential new uses of cord blood for regenerative therapy remains essential. None of the indications studied to date can be regarded as proven. Moreover, consistency in outcome reporting in terms of the instruments used and the time points for assessment after therapy are needed, including longer follow-up of study participants. Frequent and careful evaluation of the evidence will allow cord blood banks, health care providers, and patients to assess potential new options in the use of cord blood for regenerative therapy.

Heparan Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans in Glioblastoma Promote Tumor Invasion	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH												Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor of adults and confers a poor prognosis due, in part, to diffuse invasion of tumor cells. Heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans, present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, regulate cell signaling pathways and cell-microenvironment interactions. In GBM, the expression of HS glycosaminoglycans and the enzymes that regulate their function are altered, but the actual HS content and structure are unknown. However, inhibition of HS glycosaminoglycan function is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for some cancers. In this study, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to demonstrate differences in HS disaccharide content and structure across four patient-derived tumorsphere lines (GBM1, 5, 6, 43) and between two murine tumorsphere lines derived from murine GBM with enrichment of mesenchymal and proneural gene expression (mMES and mPN, respectively) markers. In GBM, the heterogeneous HS content and structure across patient-derived tumorsphere lines suggested diverse functions in the GBM tumor microenvironment. In GBM5 and mPN, elevated expression of sulfatase 2 (SULF2), an extracellular enzyme that alters ligand binding to HS, was associated with low trisulfated HS disaccharides, a substrate of SULF2. In contrast, other primary tumorsphere lines had elevated expression of the HS-modifying enzyme heparanase (HPSE). Using gene editing strategies to inhibit HPSE, a role for HPSE in promoting tumor cell adhesion and invasion was identified. These studies characterize the heterogeneity in HS glycosaminoglycan content and structure across GBM and reveal their role in tumor cell invasion.

Phillip			Topography of transcriptionally active chromatin in glioblastoma	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Molecular profiling of the most aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) on the basis of gene expression, DNA methylation, and genomic variations advances both cancer research and clinical diagnosis. The enhancer architectures and regulatory circuitries governing tumor-intrinsic transcriptional diversity and subtype identity are still elusive. Here, by mapping H3K27ac deposition, we analyze the active regulatory landscapes across 95 GBM biopsies, 12 normal brain tissues, and 38 cell line counterparts. Analyses of differentially regulated enhancers and super-enhancers uncovered previously unrecognized layers of intertumor heterogeneity. Integrative analysis of variant enhancer loci and transcriptome identified topographies of transcriptional enhancers and core regulatory circuitries in four molecular subtypes of primary tumors: AC1-mesenchymal, AC1-classical, AC2-proneural, and AC3-proneural. Moreover, this study reveals core oncogenic dependency on super-enhancer-driven transcriptional factors, long noncoding RNAs, and druggable targets in GBM. Through profiling of transcriptional enhancers, we provide clinically relevant insights into molecular classification, pathogenesis, and therapeutic intervention of GBM.

Background information and details of the projects are presented. The work has focused on modulation of target cell fate by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and RNA. Work on plant-derived vesicles is of intense interest, and non-mammalian sources of vesicles may represent a very promising source for different therapeutic approaches. Retro-viral-like particles are intriguing. Clearly, EVs share pathways with the assembly machinery of several other viruses, including human endogenous retrovirals (HERVs), and this convergence may explain the observation of viral-like particles containing viral proteins and nucleic acid in EVs. Dramatic effect on regeneration of damaged bone marrow, renal, pulmonary and cardiovascular tissue is demonstrated and discussed. These studies show restoration of injured cell function and the importance of heterogeneity of different vesicle populations. The potential for neural regeneration is explored, and the capacity to promote and reverse neoplasia by EV exposure is described. The tremendous clinical potential of EVs underlies many of these projects, and the importance of regulatory issues and the necessity of general manufacturing production (GMP) studies for eventual clinical trials are emphasized. Clinical trials are already being pursued and should expand dramatically in the near future.

Ly6C(high) monocytes are inflammatory cells that accumulate in an infarcted myocardium, and Ly6C(low) monocytes are believed to be reparative and curb myocardial remodeling. NR4A1 is a novel target for modulating the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes during atherogenesis. Objectives. We aimed to investigate whether MSCs can contribute to the heterogeneity of Ly6C(high) monocytes differentiated into Ly6C(low) monocytes and whether this regulation is related to nuclear receptor NR4A1. Methods. Ly6C(high/low) monocytes were first cocultured with MSCs. C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) mice and C57BL/6 wild-type mice were then used to construct AMI models, and survival functions in the two groups were further compared. Ly6C(high/low) monocytes in circulation and in MI tissue of C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) AMI mice with or without MSC transplantation were determined by flow cytometry at day 1 and day 3. NR4A1 expression was further determined by Western blot. Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in the infarct border zone at day 3 and day 7 was identified by TUNEL kits. Angiogenesis in the AMI heart at day 7 and day 21 was determined through immunohistochemistry by CD31. Results. We first demonstrated that the percentage of Ly6C(low) monocytes increased greatly after 3 days of coculture with MSCs (12.8%+/- 3.77% vs. 3.69%+/- 0.74%, p<0.001). The expression of NR4A1 in Ly6C(high/low) monocytes was also significantly elevated at that time (1.81 +/- 0.46 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.09, p<0.001). Following AMI, the percentage of circulating Ly6C(low) monocytes in C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) mice was significantly lower than that in C57BL/6 wild-type mice (4.36%+/- 1.27% vs. 12.17%+/- 3.81%, p<0.001). The survival rate of C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) mice (25%) was significantly lower than that of C57BL/6 wild-type mice (56.3%) after AMI (chi 2=4.343, p=0.037). After MSCs were transplanted, we observed a significant increase in Ly6C(low) monocytes both in circulation (16.7%+/- 3.67% vs. 3.22%+/- 0.44%, p<0.001) and in the MI heart (3.31%+/- 0.69% vs. 0.42%+/- 0.21%, p<0.001) of C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) mice. Western blot analysis further showed that the expression level of NR4A1 in the MI hearts of C57BL/6(CX3CR1-/-) mice increased significantly under MSC transplantation (0.39 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.04, p<0.001). We also found significantly decreased TUNEL+ cardiac myocytes (15.45%+/- 4.42% vs. 22.78%+/- 6.40%, p<0.001) in mice with high expression levels of NR4A1 compared to mice with low expression levels. Meanwhile, we further identified increased capillary density in the infarct zones of mice with high expression levels of NR4A1 (0.193 +/- 0.036 vs. 0.075 +/- 0.019, p<0.001) compared to mice with low expression levels 21 days after AMI. Conclusions. MSCs can control the heterogeneity of Ly6C(high) monocyte differentiation into Ly6C(low) monocytes and further reduce inflammation after AMI. The underlying mechanism might be that MSCs contribute to the increased expression of NR4A1 in Ly6C(high/low) monocytes.

The TNBC shows no response to hormonal therapy nor targeted therapy due to the lack of known targetable biomarkers. Furthermore, the TNBC also exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity that leads to cancer evolution, drug resistance, metastatic progression, and recurrence, arising from the tumor-initiating properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, the development of radical therapeutic regimens with high efficacy and limited side effects is crucial. In this study, we designed an innovative ternary cocktail chemotherapy by using Lovastatin (L)-loaded Janus camptothecin-floxuridine conjugate (CF) nanocapsules (NCs) with ultrahigh drug loading capacity. The obtained LCF NCs were shown to be able to suppress growth of TNBC, including inhibition of growth and metastasis of CSCs, both in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, in animal experiments, the LCF NCs showed sustained and synchronous drug release (half-life > 300 min), 85.2% reduction in pulmonary metastases, and no cancer recurrence during one-month observation post-treatment. Thus, this innovative LCF NC design provides a simple and synergistic strategy for the development of simultaneous triple chemotherapy and could be an efficacious, safe, and amenable choice with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer toxic complications than conventional multidrug delivery systems for TNBC treatment in the future.

While most PDX showed stable biomarker expression and growth phenotype, a HER2-positive PDX (PDX-BRB4) originated a subline (out of 6 studied in parallel) that progressively acquired a significantly increased tumor growth rate, resistance to cell senescence of in vitro cultures, increased stem cell marker expression and high lung metastatic ability, along with a strong decrease of BCL2 expression. RNAseq analysis of the progressed subline showed that BCL2 was connected to three main hub genes also down-regulated (CDKN2A, STAT5A and WT1). Gene expression of progressed subline suggested a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. PDX-BRB4 with its progressed subline is a preclinical model mirroring the clinical paradox of high level-BCL2 as a good prognostic factor in breast cancer. Sequential in vivo passages of PDX-BRB4 chronically treated with trastuzumab developed progressive loss of sensitivity to trastuzumab while HER2 expression and sensitivity to the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib were maintained. Long-term PDX studies, even though demanding, can originate new preclinical models, suitable to investigate the mechanisms of breast cancer progression and new therapeutic approaches.				ceccarelli, claudio/AAS-6105-2020; Santini, Donatella/AAO-1490-2021; Lollini, Pier Luigi/A-7644-2008	ceccarelli, claudio/0000-0003-0743-2087; GIUSTI, VERONICA/0000-0002-9835-4565; Laranga, Roberta/0000-0002-4021-9694; Asioli, Sofia/0000-0002-5035-2448; zanotti, simone/0000-0002-2076-3617; DE GIOVANNI, CARLA/0000-0003-4388-4988; Lollini, Pier Luigi/0000-0003-1702-4108												2045-2322					JAN 15	2021	11	1							1563	10.1038/s41598-021-81085-y							WOS:000609782400084	33452364

Results By analyzing PDA subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified that epigenetic silencing of apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATK) inversely was correlated with mRNA expression and was enriched in the quasi-mesenchymal cancer subtype. By comparing early mouse pancreatic lesions, the non-invasive regions showed AATK co-expression in cells with acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, nuclear VAV1 localization, and cell cycle suppression; but the invasive lesions conversely revealed diminished AATK expression in those with poorly differentiated histology, cytosolic VAV1 localization, and co-expression of p63 and HNF1 alpha. Transiently activated AATK initiates acinar differentiation into a ductal cell fate to establish apical-basal polarization in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Silenced AATK and ectopically expressed p63 and HNF1 alpha allow the proliferation of ductal PanINs in mice. Conclusion Epigenetic silencing ofAATKregulates the cellular transdifferentiation, proliferation, and cell cycle progression in converting PDA-subtypes.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for breast tumor initiation remain poorly understood. Here we describe a chemical screening strategy to identify small molecules that enhance the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on TIC-enriched breast cancer cells. We identified proteins that interact with the lead compound C108, including the stress granule-associated protein, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding protein 2, G3BP2. G3BP2 regulates breast tumor initiation through the stabilization of Squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 3 (SART3) mRNA, which leads to increased expression of the pluripotency transcription factors Octamer-binding protein 4 (Oct-4) and Nanog Homeobox (Nanog). Our findings suggest that G3BP2 is important for the process of breast cancer initiation. Furthermore, these data suggest a possible connection between stress granule formation and tumor initiation in breast cancer cells.

Modeling the effects of EMT-immune dynamics on carcinoma disease progression	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												During progression from carcinoma in situ to an invasive tumor, the immune system is engaged in complex sets of interactions with various tumor cells. Tumor cell plasticity alters disease trajectories via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several of the same pathways that regulate EMT are involved in tumor-immune interactions, yet little is known about the mechanisms and consequences of crosstalk between these regulatory processes. Here we introduce a multiscale evolutionary model to describe tumor-immune-EMT interactions and their impact on epithelial cancer progression from in situ to invasive disease. Through simulation of patient cohorts in silico, the model predicts that a controllable region maximizes invasion-free survival. This controllable region depends on properties of the mesenchymal tumor cell phenotype: its growth rate and its immune-evasiveness. In light of the model predictions, we analyze EMT-inflammation-associated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and find that association with EMT worsens invasion-free survival probabilities. This result supports the predictions of the model, and leads to the identification of genes that influence outcomes in bladder and uterine cancer, including FGF pathway members. These results suggest new means to delay disease progression, and demonstrate the importance of studying cancer-immune interactions in light of EMT. Bergman, Karikomi et al. propose a multiscale evolutionary model to describe tumor-immune-EMT interactions and their impact on epithelial cancer progression, which highlights a controllable region that maximizes invasion-free survival. Using EMT-inflammation associated TCGA data, the authors find EMT association worsens invasion-free survival and identify genes that influence outcomes in bladder and uterine cancer.

Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, which is associated with increased Ret and beta-catenin signalling. We thus developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes, stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of 1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of beta-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens junctions, and which was followed by beta-catenin nuclear translocation after 15 days. As a consequence, increased expression of beta-catenin-target genes was observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic beta-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.

Bioinspired Scaffold Designs for Regenerating Musculoskeletal Tissue Interfaces	REGENERATIVE ENGINEERING AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												The musculoskeletal system works at a very advanced level of synchrony, where all the physiological movements of the body are systematically performed through well-organized actions of bone in conjunction with all the other musculoskeletal soft tissues, such as ligaments, tendons, muscles, and cartilage through tissue-tissue interfaces. Interfaces are structurally and compositionally complex, consisting of gradients of extracellular matrix components and cell phenotypes as well as biochemical compositions and are important in mediating load transfer between the distinct orthopedic tissues during body movement. When an injury occurs at interface, it must be re-established to restore its function and stability. Due to the structural and compositional complexity found in interfaces, it is anticipated that they presuppose a concomitant increase in the complexity of the associated regenerative engineering approaches and scaffold designs to achieve successful interface regeneration and seamless integration of the engineered orthopedic tissues. Herein, we discuss the various bioinspired scaffold designs utilized to regenerate orthopedic tissue interfaces. First, we start with discussing the structure-function relationship at the interface. We then discuss the current understanding of the mechanism underlying interface regeneration, followed by discussing the current treatment available in the clinic to treat interface injuries. Lastly, we comprehensively discuss the state-of-the-art scaffold designs utilized to regenerate orthopedic tissue interfaces. Lay Summary Orthopedic tissues are connected to one another through interfaces that play an important role in transitioning mechanical loads between the disparate tissues. After an injury, interfaces must be re-established in order to restore joint function and stability. Understanding the mechanism governing the development of interfaces may lead to successful interface re-establishment and scaffold designs. This article discusses the current knowledge of the structure-function relationship at the interface, the mechanism underlying interface regeneration, and the current treatment available in the clinic to treat interface injuries, as well as bioinspired scaffold designs and engineering strategies to regenerate the complex orthopedic tissue interfaces.																	2364-4133	2364-4141				DEC	2020	6	4					451	483		10.1007/s40883-019-00132-3		DEC 2019					WOS:000556949600001	33344758

The aim of the present study was to phenotypically characterize their CTCs in order to explore potential therapeutic targets. Methods: PBMC's cytospins were prepared from 45 early (before and after adjuvant chemotherapy), 10 metastatic TNBC and 21 hormone receptor (HR) -positive patients. The expression of Cytokeratins (CK), ER, PR, EGFR and HER2 on CTCs was assessed using immunofluoresence staining and ARIOL analysis. Results: In early stage TNBC, ER, PR, HER2 and EGFR expressing-CTCs were detected in 24.4%, 24.4%, 20% and 40% of patients before the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, and in 17.8%, 13.3% 6.7% and 51.1% respectively after the completion of adjuvant treatment. Triple staining experiments revealed distinct subpopulations of CTC expressed HR, and ErbB family receptors. In patients with metastatic disease, the frequency of HER2+ CTCs was significantly increased compared to adjuvant setting (60% vs 20%, p=0.014). The presence of CK+PR- CTCs, before adjuvant treatment was associated with reduced OS (p=0.032) and DFI (p=0.04). Furthermore, the frequency of ER-, PR-and HER2+ CTCs was higher in HR(+) than in TNBC tumors (57.1%, p=0.006; 52.4%, p=0.021 and 52.38%, p=0.009, respectively). Conclusions: The CTCs in patients with early TNBC are phenotypically heterogeneous based on the expression of HR, EGFR and HER2 both before and after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy whereas the presence of HER2(+) CTCs prevails during disease evolution. These findings could be of clinical relevance in terms of CTC targeting.

Depleting the bioenergetics of tumors with biguanides have been suggested as an effective therapeutic approach for treating GBMs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of IM1761065, a novel biguanide with improved pharmacokinetics, on GBM-tumorspheres (TSs). Methods The biological activities of IM1761065 on GBM-TSs, including their effects on viability, ATP levels, cell cycle, stemness, invasive properties, and transcriptomes were examined. The in vivo efficacy of IM1761065 was tested in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Results IM1761065 decreased the viability and ATP levels of GBM-TSs in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced basal and spare respiratory capacity in patient-derived GBM-TS, as measured by the oxygen consumption rate. Sphere formation, expression of stemness-related proteins, and invasive capacity of GBM-TSs were also significantly suppressed by IM1761065. A gene-ontology comparison of IM1761065-treated groups showed that the expression levels of stemness-related, epithelial mesenchymal transition-related, and mitochondrial complex I genes were also significantly downregulated by IM1761065. An orthotopic xenograft mouse model showed decreased bioluminescence in IM1761065-treated cell-injected mice at 5 weeks. IM1761065-treated group showed longer survival than the control group (P = 0.0289, log-rank test). Conclusion IM1761065 is a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of IM1761065 on the bioenergetics of GBM-TS suggests that this novel compound could be used as a new drug for the treatment of GBM.

This heterogeneity makes it difficult to determine which patients will benefit most from adjuvant therapy and impedes the development of new targeted agents(1). More insight into the biological diversity of colon cancers, especially in relation to clinical features, is therefore needed. We demonstrate, using an unsupervised classification strategy involving over 1,100 individuals with colon cancer, that three main molecularly distinct subtypes can be recognized. Two subtypes have been previously identified and are well characterized (chromosomal-instable and microsatellite-instable cancers)(2). The third subtype is largely microsatellite stable and contains relatively more CpG island methylator phenotype positive carcinomas but cannot be identified on the basis of characteristic mutations. We provide evidence that this subtype relates to sessile-serrated adenomas, which show highly similar gene expression profiles, including upregulation of genes involved in matrix remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The identification of this subtype is crucial, as it has a very unfavorable prognosis and, moreover, is refractory to epidermal growth factor receptor targeted therapy.

To overcome the limitation, a novel fluidized bed bioreactor has emerged. However, a detailed understanding of its fluid dynamics is still lacking. RESULTSA 3D modeling approach that couples computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a discrete element method (DEM) was used to simulate the liquid and solid flows in a bioreactor being designed for stem cells expansion. The model was validated by comparing the simulation results with literature experimental data [Chem Eng Sci60:1889-1900 (2005)], which showed a good agreement. Using the validated model, the effects of the superficial liquid velocity, particle size and particle density on the solids volume fraction, shear stress on the particles and liquid-solid mass transfer coefficient of dissolved oxygen and glucose were analyzed. CONCLUSIONSSimulation results show that particle size and density have an important impact on the shear stress distribution, and that the liquid velocity affects the shear stress distribution rather modestly when its value is beyond the minimum fluidization velocity. The liquid-particle mass transfer coefficient of dissolved oxygen and glucose can be improved by raising the liquid velocity, and the adoption of a high-density material allows the reactor to operate with higher liquid velocities before reaching shear stress heterogeneities. Furthermore, the two objectives, (i) maintaining lower and homogeneously distributed shear stress and (ii) improving mass transfer, pose conflicting requirements on certain design parameters which need to be carefully considered in the reactor design.

The Interplay between Chondrocyte Redifferentiation Pellet Size and Oxygen Concentration	PLOS ONE												Chondrocytes dedifferentiate during ex vivo expansion on 2-dimensional surfaces. Aggregation of the expanded cells into 3-dimensional pellets, in the presence of induction factors, facilitates their redifferentiation and restoration of the chondrogenic phenotype. Typically 1x10(5)-5x10(5) chondrocytes are aggregated, resulting in "macro" pellets having diameters ranging from 1-2 mm. These macropellets are commonly used to study redifferentiation, and recently macropellets of autologous chondrocytes have been implanted directly into articular cartilage defects to facilitate their repair. However, diffusion of metabolites over the 1-2 mm pellet length-scales is inefficient, resulting in radial tissue heterogeneity. Herein we demonstrate that the aggregation of 2x10(5) human chondrocytes into micropellets of 166 cells each, rather than into larger single macropellets, enhances chondrogenic redifferentiation. In this study, we describe the development of a cost effective fabrication strategy to manufacture a microwell surface for the large-scale production of micropellets. The thousands of micropellets were manufactured using the microwell platform, which is an array of 360x360 mu m microwells cast into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), that has been surface modified with an electrostatic multilayer of hyaluronic acid and chitosan to enhance micropellet formation. Such surface modification was essential to prevent chondrocyte spreading on the PDMS. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) production and collagen II gene expression in chondrocyte micropellets increased significantly relative to macropellet controls, and redifferentiation was enhanced in both macro and micropellets with the provision of a hypoxic atmosphere (2% O-2). Once micropellet formation had been optimized, we demonstrated that micropellets could be assembled into larger cartilage tissues. Our results indicate that micropellet amalgamation efficiency is inversely related to the time cultured as discreet microtissues. In summary, we describe a micropellet production platform that represents an efficient tool for studying chondrocyte redifferentiation and demonstrate that the micropellets could be assembled into larger tissues, potentially useful in cartilage defect repair.				; Lott, William/J-1062-2012	Cooper-White, Justin/0000-0002-1920-8229; Crawford, Ross/0000-0001-6079-1316; Lott, William/0000-0001-7118-7560; Klein, Travis/0000-0002-6669-7766; Doran, Michael/0000-0001-5876-4757												1932-6203					MAR 15	2013	8	3							e58865	10.1371/journal.pone.0058865							WOS:000316409800039	23554943

Notch in Head and Neck Cancer	NOTCH SIGNALING IN EMBRYOLOGY AND CANCER: NOTCH SIGNALING IN CANCER	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Head and neck cancer is a group of neoplastic diseases affecting the facial, oral, and neck region. It is one of the most common cancers worldwide with an aggressive, invasive evolution. Due to the heterogeneity of the tissues affected, it is particularly challenging to study the molecular mechanisms at the basis of these tumors, and to date we are still lacking accurate targets for prevention and therapy. The Notch signaling is involved in a variety of tumorigenic mechanisms, such as regulation of the tumor microenvironment, aberrant intercellular communication, and altered metabolism. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of the role of Notch in head and neck cancer and draw parallels with other types of solid tumors where the Notch pathway plays a crucial role in emergence, maintenance, and progression of the disease. We therefore give a perspective view on the importance of the pathway in neoplastic development in order to define future lines of research and novel therapeutic approaches.

The unique mechanical properties of bone extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly composed of hydroxyapatite (HA) affect a number of cellular responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as proliferation, migration, viability, and morphology, as well as angiogenic activity, which is related to bone metastasis. In this study, we engineered a bone-mimetic microenvironment to investigate the interactions between the TME and HA using a microfluidic platform designed for culturing tumor cells in 3D bone-mimetic composite of HA and fibrin. We developed a bone metastasis TME model from colorectal cancer (SW620) and gastric cancer (MKN74) cells, which has very poor prognosis but rarely been investigated. The microfluidic platform enabled straightforward formation of 3D TME composed the hydrogel and multiple cell types. This facilitated monitoring of the effect of HA concentration and culture time on the TME. In 3D bone mimicking culture, we found that HA rich microenvironment affects cell viability, proliferation and cancer cell cytoplasmic volume in a manner dependent on the different metastatic cancer cell types and culture duration indicating the spatial heterogeneity (different origin of metastatic cancer) and temporal heterogeneity (growth time of cancer) of TME. We also found that both SW620 and MKN72 cells exhibited significantly reduced migration at higher HA concentration in our platform indicating inhibitory effect of HA in both cancer cells migration. Next, we quantitatively analyzed angiogenic sprouts induced by paracrine factors that secreted by TME and showed paracrine signals from tumor and stromal cell with a high HA concentration resulted in the formation of fewer sprouts. Finally we reconstituted vascularized TME allowing direct interaction between angiogenic sprouts and tumor-stroma microspheroids in a bone-mimicking microenvironment composing a tunable HA/fibrin composite. Our multifarious approach could be applied to drug screening and mechanistic studies of the metastasis, growth, and progression of bone tumors.

However, limited efficacy due to drug resistance and toxicity are obstacles to clinical use of Hsp90 inhibitors, suggesting the necessity to develop novel Hsp90 inhibitors overcoming these limitations. Methods: The underlying mechanism of resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors was investigated by colony formation assay, sphere formation assay, western blot analysis, and real-time PCR. To develop anticancer Hsp90 inhibitors that overcome the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated resistance, we synthesized and screened a series of synthetic deguelin-based compounds in terms of inhibition of colony formation, migration, and viability of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and toxicity to normal cells. Regulation of Hsp90 by the selected compound NCT-80 [5-methoxy-N-(3-methoxy-4-(2-(pyridin3-yl)ethoxy)phenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromene-6-carboxamide] was investigated by immunoprecipitation, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, binding experiments using ATP-agarose beads and biotinylated drug, and docking analysis. The antitumor, antimetastatic, and anti-CSC effects of NCT-80 were examined in vitro and in vivo using various assays such as MTT, colony formation, and migration assays and flow cytometric analysis and tumor xenograft models. Results: We demonstrated a distinct mechanism in which Hsp90 inhibitors that block N-terminal ATP-binding pocket causes transcriptional upregulation of Wnt ligands through Akt-and ERK-mediated activation of STAT3, resulting in NSCLC cell survival in an autocrine or paracrine manner. In addition, NCT-80 effectively reduced viability, colony formation, migration, and CSC-like phenotypes of NSCLC cells and their sublines with acquired resistance to anticancer drugs by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the growth of NSCLC patient-derived xenograft tumors without overt toxicity. With regards to mechanism, NCT-80 directly bound to the C-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, disrupting the interaction between Hsp90 and STAT3 and degrading STAT3 protein. Moreover, NCT-80 inhibited chemotherapy-and EGFR TKI-induced programmed cell death ligand 1 expression and potentiated the antitumor effect of chemotherapy in the LLC-Luc allograft model. Conclusions: These data indicate the potential of STAT3/Wnt signaling pathway as a target to overcome resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors and NCT-80 as a novel Hsp90 inhibitor that targets both CSCs and non-CSCs in NSCLC.																	1838-7640						2022	12	1					105	125		10.7150/thno.63788							WOS:000719122000008

We previously observed upregulation of the TAM (Tyro-3, Axl, and Mer) receptor tyrosine kinase family member AXL in mesenchymal GBM and showed that knockdown of AXL induced apoptosis of mesenchymal, but not proneural, glioma sphere cultures (GSC). In this study, we report that BGB324, a novel small molecule inhibitor of AXL, prolongs the survival of immunocompromised mice bearing GSC-derived mesenchymal GBM-like tumors. We show that protein S (PROS1), a known ligand of other TAM receptors, was secreted by tumor-associated macrophages/microglia and subsequently physically associated with and activated AXL in mesenchymal GSC. PROS1-driven phosphorylation of AXL (pAXL) induced NFkB activation in mesenchymal GSC, which was inhibited by BGB324 treatment. We also found that treatment of GSC-derived mouse GBM tumors with nivolumab, a blocking antibody against the immune checkpoint protein PD-1, increased intratumoral macrophages/microglia and activation of AXL. Combinatorial therapy with nivolumab plus BGB324 effectively prolonged the survival of mice bearing GBM tumors. Clinically, expression of AXL or PROS1 was associated with poor prognosis for patients with GBM. Our results suggest that the PROS1-AXL pathway regulates intrinsic mesenchymal signaling and the extrinsic immune microenvironment, contributing to the growth of aggressive GBM tumors. Significance: These findings suggest that development of combination treatments of AXL and immune checkpoint inhibitors may provide benefit to patients with GBM. (C) 2018 AACR.

The characterization of fabricated nanocomposites was done by using techniques like Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Investigation of osteogenic differentiation effects in the mesenchyme cells derived from the bone marrow (BMSCs) of rat and corresponding mechanisms were carried out for the 1st time by using the prepared composite. GO-Fe3O4 could noticeably increase BMSCs osteogenic differentiation other than being biocompatible at lower concentrations. Concentration relayed characteristics were shown in GO-Fe3O4 treated BMSCs bone development differentiation as well as in their cellular behavior. Additionally, GO-Fe3O4 displayed different effects on cell viability through dose-dependent selective killing of cancer cells without affecting normal cells in the MTT assay.

Estrogen Withdrawal from Osteoblasts and Osteocytes Causes Increased Mineralization and Apoptosis	HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH												Recent studies have demonstrated increased bone mineral heterogeneity following estrogen withdrawal in vivo. Such changes likely contribute to fracture risk during post-menopausal osteoporosis since tissue mineralization is correlated with bone strength and stiffness. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for increased mineral variability have not yet been distinguished. The objective of this study is to elucidate how alterations in mineral distribution are initiated during estrogen depletion. Specifically, we tested 2 separate hypotheses; (1) estrogen deficiency directly alters osteoblast mineralization and (2) estrogen deficiency increases bone cell apoptosis. Osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteocyte-like cells (MLO-Y4) were pretreated with or without estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) for 14 days. Estrogen deficiency was subsequently induced by either withdrawing estrogen from cells or blocking estrogen receptors using an estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant (ICI 182,780). Cell number (Hoechst DNA), alkaline phosphatase activity (p-NPP), mineralization (alizarin red) and apoptosis (Caspase 3/7) were evaluated. Whether estrogen withdrawal altered apoptosis rates in the presence of an apoptosis promoting agent (etoposide) was also determined. Interestingly, estrogen withdrawal from cells accustomed to estrogen exposure caused significantly increased osteoblast mineralization and osteocyte apoptosis compared with continued estrogen treatment. In contrast, blocking estrogen receptors with fulvestrant abrogated the mineralization induced by estrogen treatment. When apoptosis was induced using etoposide, cells undergoing estrogen withdrawal increased apoptosis compared to cells with continued estrogen treatment. Recognizing the underlying mechanisms regulating bone cell mineralization and apoptosis during estrogen deficiency and their consequences is necessary to further our knowledge of osteoporosis.

We provide a comprehensive characterization of the largest series of CL samples reported so far. Methods: From a data set of 5447 invasive BC profiled using DNA microarrays, we identified 673 CL samples (12,4%) that we describe comparatively to the other molecular subtypes at several levels: clinicopathological, genomic, transcriptional, survival, and response to chemotherapy. Results: CL samples display profiles different from other subtypes. For example, they differ from basal tumors regarding the hormone receptor status, with a lower frequency of triple negative (TN) tumors (52% vs 76% for basal cases). Like basal tumors, they show high genomic instability with many gains and losses. At the transcriptional level, CL tumors are the most undifferentiated tumors along the mammary epithelial hierarchy. Compared to basal tumors, they show enrichment for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, immune response genes, and cancer stem cell-like features, and higher activity of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), EGFR, SRC and TGF beta pathways, but lower activity of MYC and PI3K pathways. The 5-year disease-free survival of CL cases (67%) and the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) to primary chemotherapy (32%) are close to those of poor-prognosis and good responder subtypes (basal and ERBB2-enriched). However, the prognostic features of CL tumors are closer to those observed in the whole BC series and in the luminal A subtype, including proliferation-related gene expression signatures (GES). Immunity-related GES valuable in basal breast cancers are not significant in CL tumors. By contrast, the GES predictive for pCR in CL tumors resemble more to those of basal and HER2-enriched tumors than to those of luminal A tumors. Conclusions: Many differences exist between CL and the other subtypes, notably basal. An unexpected finding concerns the relatively high numbers of ER-positive and non-TN tumors within CL subtype, suggesting a larger heterogeneity than in basal and luminal A subtypes.

The latest Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States data shows that AT/RT constitutes 16.6% of all embryonal tumors in children. The molecular hallmark of this tumor is pathogenic SMARCB1 genetic alterations resulting in the loss of INI-1 immunopositivity, with fewer tumors harboring SMARCA4 (BRG1) variants. Maternal embryonal leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a member of the Snf1/AMPK family of serine/threonine-protein kinases involved in various processes such as cell cycle regulation, self-renewal of stem cells, apoptosis, and splicing regulation. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of MELK in AT/RT and its possible therapeutic role. The purpose of this study was to review the histological and immunohistochemical profile of AT/RT with special reference to MELK staining. In this retrospective study conducted over 6 years, all diagnosed cases of AT/RT, defined by loss of INI-1 immunopositivity, were retrieved and studied. Demographic details of patients and microscopic findings were analyzed, with special attention to histological patterns and immunohistochemistry profile including MELK immunoreactivity. There were 50 cases of AT/RT diagnosed in the specified period. Of the cases operated at our institute during this period, embryonal tumors constituted 20.6% of all pediatric brain tumors with AT/RT representing 12.6% of this subset. The median age at presentation was 3.5 years (range: 8 months-22 years) and there were three adult cases. Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 1.94:1. Tumor location was distributed equally between the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments. Characteristic rhabdoid cells were identified in 70% of cases. Areas with epithelial, mesenchymal, and undifferentiated tumor cells were seen in 8%, 20%, and 52% of cases, respectively. Cells with vacuolated cytoplasm were noted in 28% of cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a polyimmunophenotypic profile with immunopositivity for GFAP in 70%, Vimentin in 100%, SMA in 68%, and EMA in 88% of cases, indicating the remarkable heterogeneity of the tumor cells. MELK immunopositivity was noted in 83.33% of cases. Thus, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are rare neoplasms. In line with other studies, we show that these tumors occur predominantly in very young children and display marked variability on histology and IHC with loss of INI-1. MELK is presumed to be an important molecule involved in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and other critical functions. High expression of MELK in AT/RT may suggest its plausible role in neoplastic transformation of embryonic and postnatal multipotent neural progenitors which in turn could explain the diverse morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics observed in these tumors.

Early In Vitro Differentiation of Mouse Definitive Endoderm Is Not Correlated with Progressive Maturation of Nuclear DNA Methylation Patterns	PLOS ONE												The genome organization in pluripotent cells undergoing the first steps of differentiation is highly relevant to the reprogramming process in differentiation. Considering this fact, chromatin texture patterns that identify cells at the very early stage of lineage commitment could serve as valuable tools in the selection of optimal cell phenotypes for regenerative medicine applications. Here we report on the first-time use of high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescence imaging and comprehensive topological cell-by-cell analyses with a novel image-cytometrical approach towards the identification of in situ global nuclear DNA methylation patterns in early endodermal differentiation of mouse ES cells (up to day 6), and the correlations of these patterns with a set of putative markers for pluripotency and endodermal commitment, and the epithelial and mesenchymal character of cells. Utilizing this in vitro cell system as a model for assessing the relationship between differentiation and nuclear DNA methylation patterns, we found that differentiating cell populations display an increasing number of cells with a gain in DNA methylation load: first within their euchromatin, then extending into heterochromatic areas of the nucleus, which also results in significant changes of methylcytosine/global DNA codistribution patterns. We were also able to co-visualize and quantify the concomitant stochastic marker expression on a per-cell basis, for which we did not measure any correlation to methylcytosine loads or distribution patterns. We observe that the progression of global DNA methylation is not correlated with the standard transcription factors associated with endodermal development. Further studies are needed to determine whether the progression of global methylation could represent a useful signature of cellular differentiation. This concept of tracking epigenetic progression may prove useful in the selection of cell phenotypes for future regenerative medicine applications.

The ErbB2 Delta Ex16 splice variant is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that promotes a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment	ONCOGENE												Amplification and overexpression of erbB2/neu proto-oncogene is observed in 20-30% human breast cancer and is inversely correlated with the survival of the patient. Despite this, somatic activating mutations within erbB2 in human breast cancers are rare. However, we have previously reported that a splice isoform of erbB2, containing an in-frame deletion of exon 16 (herein referred to as ErbB2 Delta Ex16), results in oncogenic activation of erbB2 because of constitutive dimerization of the ErbB2 receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the ErbB2 Delta Ex16 is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that constitutively signals from the cell surface. We further show that inducible expression of the ErbB2 Delta Ex16 variant in mammary gland of transgenic mice results in the rapid development of metastatic multifocal mammary tumors. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the ErbB2 Delta Ex16-derived mammary tumors exhibit several unique features that distinguish this model from the conventional ErbB2 ones expressing the erbB2 proto-oncogene in mammary epithelium. Unlike the wild-type ErbB2-derived tumors that express luminal keratins, ErbB2 Delta Ex16-derived tumors exhibit high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity co-expressing both basal and luminal keratins. Consistent with these distinct pathological features, the ErbB2 Delta Ex16 tumors exhibit distinct signaling and gene expression profiles that correlate with activation of number of key transcription factors implicated in breast cancer metastasis and cancer stem cell renewal.

Critical research gaps and translational priorities for the successful prevention and treatment of breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH												Introduction: Breast cancer remains a significant scientific, clinical and societal challenge. This gap analysis has reviewed and critically assessed enduring issues and new challenges emerging from recent research, and proposes strategies for translating solutions into practice. Methods: More than 100 internationally recognised specialist breast cancer scientists, clinicians and healthcare professionals collaborated to address nine thematic areas: genetics, epigenetics and epidemiology; molecular pathology and cell biology; hormonal influences and endocrine therapy; imaging, detection and screening; current/ novel therapies and biomarkers; drug resistance; metastasis, angiogenesis, circulating tumour cells, cancer `stem' cells; risk and prevention; living with and managing breast cancer and its treatment. The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account. Results: The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility. The proposed infrastructural enablers include enhanced resources to support clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumour models; improved access to appropriate, fully annotated clinical samples; extended biomarker discovery, validation and standardisation; and facilitated cross-discipline working. Conclusions: With resources to conduct further high-quality targeted research focusing on the gaps identified, increased knowledge translating into improved clinical care should be achievable within five years.

Nanodiamond-Gadolinium(III) Aggregates for Tracking Cancer Growth In Vivo at High Field	NANO LETTERS												The ability to track labeled cancer cells in vivo would allow researchers to study their distribution, growth, and metastatic potential within the intact organism. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is invaluable for tracking cancer cells in vivo as it benefits from high spatial resolution and the absence of ionizing radiation. However, many MR contrast agents (CAs) required to label cells either do not significantly accumulate in cells or are not biologically compatible for translational studies. We have developed carbon based nanodiamond-gadolinium(III) aggregates (NDG) for MR imaging that demonstrated remarkable properties for cell tracking in vivo. First, NDG had high relaxivity independent of field strength, a finding unprecedented for gadolinium(III) [Gd(III)]-nanopartide conjugates. Second, NDG demonstrated a 300-fold increase in the cellular delivery of Gd(III) compared to that of clinical Gd(III) chelates without sacrificing biocompatibility. Further, we were able to monitor the tumor growth of NDG-labeled flank tumors by T-1- and T-2-weighted MR imaging for 26 days in vivo, longer than was reported for other MR CAs or nuclear agents. Finally, by utilizing quantitative maps of relaxation times, we were able to describe tumor morphology and heterogeneity (corroborated by histological analysis), which would not be possible with competing molecular imaging modalities.

In vivo evaluation of a multiphased scaffold designed for orthopaedic interface tissue engineering and soft tissue-to-bone integration	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A					8th World Biomaterials Congress	MAY 28-JUN 01, 2008	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					Achieving functional graft integration with subchondral bone poses a significant challenge for orthopaedic soft tissue repair and reconstruction. Soft tissues such as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) integrate with bone through a fibrocartilage interface, which minimizes stress concentrations and mediates load transfer between soft and hard tissues. We propose that biological fixation can be achieved by regenerating this fibrocartilage interface on biological or synthetic ACL grafts. This study focuses on the in vivo evaluation of a stratified scaffold predesigned to mimic the multitissue transition found at the ACL-to-bone interface. Specifically, the scaffold consists of three distinct yet continuous phases: Phase A for ligament formation, Phase B for the interface, and Phase C for the bone region. Interface-relevant cell types, specifically fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, will be tri-cultured on this scaffold, and the formation of cell type- and phase-specific matrix heterogeneity as well as fibrocartilage formation will be evaluated over 8 weeks in a subcutaneous athymic rat model. Acellular scaffolds as well as scaffolds co-cultured with fibroblasts and osteoblasts will serve as controls. It was found that the triphasic scaffold supported multilineage cellular interactions as well as tissue infiltration and abundant matrix production in vivo. In addition, controlled phase-specific matrix heterogeneity was induced on the scaffold, with distinct mineral and fibrocartilage-like tissue regions formed in the tri-cultured group. Cell seeding had a positive effect on both host infiltration and matrix elaboration, which also translated into increased mechanical properties in the seeded groups compared to the acellular controls. In summary, the biomimetic and multiphasic design coupled with spatial control of cell distribution enables multitissue regeneration on the stratified scaffold, and demonstrates the potential for regenerating the interface between soft tissue grafts and bone.

Curcumin on the "flying carpets" to modulate different signal transduction cascades in cancers: Next-generation approach to bridge translational gaps	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY												Curcumin, a bioactive and pharmacologically efficient component isolated from Curcuma longa has attracted considerable attention because of its ability to modulate diverse cellular and physiological pathways. WNT, TGF/SMAD, NOTCH, and SHH are fundamentally different signaling cascades, but their choreographed activation is strongly associated with cancer development and progression. In this review we have attempted to set spotlight on regulation of different cell signaling pathways by curcumin in different cancers. We partition this multi-component review into in-depth biological understanding of various signal transduction cascades and how curcumin targets intracellular signal transducers of deregulated pathways to inhibit cancer development and progression. Rapidly broadening landscape of both established and candidate oncogenic driver mutations identified in different cancers is a major stumbling block in the standardization of drugs having significant clinical outcome. Intra and inter-tumor heterogeneity had leveraged the complexity of therapeutic challenges to another level. Multi-pronged approach and molecularly guided treatments will be helpful in improving the clinical outcome.

Alterations in Wnt- and/or STAT3 signaling pathways and the immune microenvironment during metastatic progression	ONCOGENE												Metastatic breast cancer is an extremely complex disease with limited treatment options due to the lack of information about the major characteristics of metastatic disease. There is an urgent need, therefore, to understand the changes in cellular complexity and dynamics that occur during metastatic progression. In the current study, we analyzed the cellular and molecular differences between primary tumors and paired lung metastases using a syngeneic p53-null mammary tumor model of basal-like breast cancer. Distinct subpopulations driven by the Wnt- and/or STAT3 signaling pathways were detected in vivo using a lentiviral Wnt- and STAT3 signaling reporter system. A significant increase in the overlapping populations driven by both the Wnt- and STAT3 signaling pathways was observed in the lung metastases as compared to the primary tumors. Furthermore, the overlapping populations showed a higher metastatic potential relative to the other populations and pharmacological inhibition of both signaling pathways was shown to markedly reduce the metastatic lesions in established lung metastases. An analysis of the unique molecular features of the lung metastases revealed a significant association with immune response signatures. Specifically, Foxp3 gene expression was markedly increased and elevated levels of Foxp3 + Treg cells were detected in close proximity to lung metastases. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of analyzing intratumoral heterogeneity, changes in population dynamics, and the immune microenvironment during metastatic progression.

Unless treated, tumors, however, do not heal in contrast to wounds that heal within a limited time framework. Wounds heal in coordination of a myriad of types of cells, particularly endothelial cells, leukocytes, and fibroblasts. Similar sets of cells also contribute to cancer initiation and progression, and as a consequence, anti-cancer treatment strategies have been proposed and tested by targeting endothelial cells and/or leukocytes. Compared with endothelial cells and leukocytes, less attention has been paid to the roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), fibroblasts present in tumor tissues, because their heterogeneity hinders the elucidation on them at cellular and molecular levels. Here, we will discuss the origin of CAFs and their crucial roles in cancer initiation and progression, and the possibility to develop a novel type of anti-cancer treatment by manipulating the migration and functions of CAFs.

Cellular biology of fracture healing	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH												The biology of bone healing is a rapidly developing science. Advances in transgenic and gene-targeted mice have enabled tissue and cell-specific investigations of skeletal regeneration. As an example, only recently has it been recognized that chondrocytes convert to osteoblasts during healing bone, and only several years prior, seminal publications reported definitively that the primary tissues contributing bone forming cells during regeneration were the periosteum and endosteum. While genetically modified animals offer incredible insights into the temporal and spatial importance of various gene products, the complexity and rapidity of healingcoupled with the heterogeneity of animal modelsrenders studies of regenerative biology challenging. Herein, cells that play a key role in bone healing will be reviewed and extracellular mediators regulating their behavior discussed. We will focus on recent studies that explore novel roles of inflammation in bone healing, and the origins and fates of various cells in the fracture environment.

This is likely due to the resistance of slowly proliferating tumour-initiating cells (TICs), and understanding molecular mechanisms that control TICs behaviour is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we present our novel findings, indicating that an intrinsically catalytically inactive member of the Eph group of receptor tyrosine kinases, EPHB6, partially suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in TNBC cells, while also promoting expansion of TICs. Our work reveals that EPHB6 interacts with the GRB2 adapter protein and that its effect on enhancing cell proliferation is mediated by the activation of the RAS-ERK pathway, which allows it to elevate the expression of the TIC-related transcription factor, OCT4. Consistent with this, suppression of either ERK or OCT4 activities blocks EPHB6-induced pro-proliferative responses. In line with its ability to trigger propagation of TICs, EPHB6 accelerates tumour growth, potentiates tumour initiation and increases TIC populations in xenograft models of TNBC. Remarkably, EPHB6 also suppresses tumour drug resistance to DNA-damaging therapy, probably by forcing TICs into a more proliferative, drug-sensitive state. In agreement, patients with higher EPHB6 expression in their tumours have a better chance for recurrence-free survival. These observations describe an entirely new mechanism that governs TNBC and suggest that it may be beneficial to enhance EPHB6 action concurrent with applying a conventional DNA-damaging treatment, as it would decrease drug resistance and improve tumour elimination.

The Combined Influence of Hydrogel Stiffness and Matrix-Bound Hyaluronic Acid Content on Glioblastoma Invasion	MACROMOLECULAR BIOSCIENCE												Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. Its high mortality is associated with its aggressive invasion throughout the brain. The heterogeneity of stiffness and hyaluronic acid (HA) content within the brain makes it difficult to study invasion in vivo. A dextran-bead assay is employed to quantify GBM invasion within HA-functionalized gelatin hydrogels. Using a library of stiffness-matched hydrogels with variable levels of matrix-bound HA, it is reported that U251 GBM invasion is enhanced in softer hydrogels but reduced in the presence of matrix-bound HA. Inhibiting HA-CD44 interactions reduces invasion, even in hydrogels lacking matrix-bound HA. Analysis of HA biosynthesis suggests that GBM cells compensate for a lack of matrix-bound HA by producing soluble HA to stimulate invasion. Together, a robust method is showed to quantify GBM invasion over long culture times to reveal the coordinated effect of matrix stiffness, immobilized HA, and compensatory HA production on GBM invasion.

Paul; Eckstein, Anja; Berchner-Pfannschmidt, Utta			Pathogenic Phenotype of Adipogenesis and Hyaluronan in Orbital Fibroblasts From Female Graves' Orbitopathy Mouse Model	ENDOCRINOLOGY												A mouse model of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) induced by genetic immunization of human TSH receptor (TSHR) A-subunit encoding plasmid has recently been established. The orbital pathology was characterized by adipogenesis, myopathy and fibrosis. Human orbital fibroblasts (OFs) express TSHR and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and are considered to be pathogenic in GO. We established conditions for growing ex vivo cultures of mouse OFs (mOFs) from orbital tissue of animals undergoing GO and controls. Early passage mOFs showed characteristic fibroblast morphology and expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers including a strong expression of CD90.2 and CD40, whereas display of CD73 and all other leucocyte markers was uniformly absent. Importantly, OFs derived from GO mice expressed elevated levels of TSHR and IGF-1R and showed enhanced adipogensis compared with controls. Activation of TSHR in mOFs from GO animals with TSH, monoclonal thyroid-stimulating antibody M22, or stimulation of IGF-1R with IGF-1-induced hyaluronan secretion to significantly elevated levels compared with control animals. Hyaluronan synthase 2 was more abundant in OFs derived from GO mice. In conclusion, mOFs established from GO model recapitulate the pathogenicity of human OFs from GO patients by their increased propensity for adipogenesis and hyaluronan production leading to disease activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show mOFs from the preclinical GO model have pathogenic properties that will aid in understanding the molecular and genetic changes during progression to adipogenesis and hyaluronan deposition to provide new insights into GO pathogenesis.

Major progress has been achieved through the development of innovative biomanufacturing strategies to pattern and assemble cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in three-dimensions (3D) to create functional tissue constructs. Bioprinting has emerged as a promising 3D biomanufacturing technology, enabling precise control over spatial and temporal distribution of cells and ECM. Bioprinting technology can be used to engineer artificial tissues and organs by producing scaffolds with controlled spatial heterogeneity of physical properties, cellular composition, and ECM organization. This innovative approach is increasingly utilized in biomedicine, and has potential to create artificial functional constructs for drug screening and toxicology research, as well as tissue and organ transplantation. Herein, we review the recent advances in bioprinting technologies and discuss current markets, approaches, and biomedical applications. We also present current challenges and provide future directions for bioprinting research.

Previously, we have shown that dedifferentiated tumor cells at the invasive front (IF) accumulate the transcriptional activator beta-catenin in the nucleus, in contrast to cells of the tumor center. To characterize the cells of these two morphogenic tumor areas, gene expression profiling was performed. Our study demonstrates that intratumorous heterogeneity in colorectal cancer correlates with differential expression of 510 genes between the central tumor region (TC) and the IF. Many genes differentially expressed at the IF are involved in cellular invasion processes like cell motility, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interaction. This in vivo analysis shows overexpression of known Wnt/beta-catenin target genes either in the entire tumor tissue (compared to normal mucosa) or specifically at the IF. Thus, even though all tumor cells overexpress beta-catenin, the existence of at least 2 groups of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes selectively activated in different tumor regions is suggested. The concomitant high expression of inflammation- and tissue repair-related genes at the IF supports the hypothesis that an inflammation-activated microenvironment may trigger selective Wnt/beta-catenin target gene expression and contribute to the malignant progression of colorectal cancer.

Contrary to this conventional "phenotype switching" model, we now show that disease progression can involve malignant melanoma cells simultaneously displaying proliferative and invasive properties. Using a genetic mouse model of melanoma in combination with in vitro analyses of melanoma cell lines, we found that conditional deletion of the downstream signaling molecule Smad4, which abrogates all canonical TGF-beta signaling, indeed inhibited both tumor growth and metastasis. Conditional deletion of the inhibitory signaling factor Smad7, however, generated cells that are both highly invasive and proliferative, indicating that invasiveness is compatible with a high proliferation rate. In fact, conditional Smad7 deletion led to sustained melanoma growth and at the same time promoted massive metastasis formation, a result consistent with data indicating that low SMAD7 levels in patient tumors are associated with a poor survival. Our findings reveal that modulation of SMAD7 levels can overcome the need for phenotype switching during tumor progression and may thus represent a therapeutic target in metastatic disease.

We aim to establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes that would encompass this heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We use gene expression data to describe four molecular subtypes linked to distinct patterns of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis. The mesenchymal-like type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (63%) of the four subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the lowest frequency of recurrence (22%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein 53 (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical translational research.

An electronic search was conducted using databases of PubMed and EMBASE up to November 2016 to identify studies focusing on osseointegration of strontium-modified titanium implants following PRISMA criteria. The primary outcome was the percentage of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) around the implants with or without strontium-modified surface. Of the 1320 studies, 17 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were finally included. A random effect meta-analysis was conducted based on BIC in 17 studies, and the results demonstrated considerable heterogeneity (I-2 = 79%). A sensitivity analysis found that three studies using the same surface modification method were the major source of the heterogeneity. Therefore, exploratory subgroup analysis was performed. Subgroup one including 14 studies showed a standard mean differences (SMD) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.13-1.71) with no heterogeneity (I-2 = 0.0%), while subgroup two including the other three studies showed a SMD of 9.49.95% CI, 7.51-11.47) with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 0.1%). Sr-modified implants in both subgroups showed significantly higher BIC than unmodified implants (P < 0.01). The results showed a statistically significant effect of Sr-modified titanium implant surfaces on osseointegration and bone apposition in animal models.

Modeling Tumor Phenotypes In Vitro with Three-Dimensional Bioprinting	CELL REPORTS												The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor growth, progression, and therapeutic resistance, but interrogating the role of specific tumor-stromal interactions on tumorigenic phenotypes is challenging within in vivo tissues. Here, we tested whether three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting could improve in vitro models by incorporating multiple cell types into scaffold-free tumor tissues with defined architecture. We generated tumor tissues from distinct subtypes of breast or pancreatic cancer in relevant microenvironments and demonstrate that this technique can model patient-specific tumors by using primary patient tissue. We assess intrinsic, extrinsic, and spatial tumorigenic phenotypes in bio-printed tissues and find that cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and cellular migration are altered in response to extrinsic signals or therapies. Together, this work demonstrates that multi-cell-type bioprinted tissues can recapitulate aspects of in vivo neoplastic tissues and provide a manipulable system for the interrogation of multiple tumorigenic endpoints in the context of distinct tumor microenvironments.

Limbostomy: Longitudinal Intravital Microendoscopy in Murine Osteotomies	CYTOMETRY PART A												Bone healing involves the interplay of immune cells, mesenchymal cells, and vasculature over the time course of regeneration. Approaches to quantify the spatiotemporal aspects of bone healing at cellular resolution during long bone healing do not yet exist. Here, a novel technique termed Limbostomy is presented, which combines intravital microendoscopy with an osteotomy. This design allows a modular combination of an internal fixator plate with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens at various depths in the bone marrow and can be combined with a surgical osteotomy procedure. The field of view (FOV) covers a significant area of the fracture gap and allows monitoring cellular processes in vivo. The GRIN lens causes intrinsic optical aberrations which have to be corrected. The optical system was characterized and a postprocessing algorithm was developed. It corrects for wave front aberration-induced image plane deformation and for background and noise signals, enabling us to observe subcellular processes. Exemplarily, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyze angiogenesis in bone regeneration. We make use of a transgenic reporter mouse strain with nucleargreen fluorescent protein and membrane-bound tdTomato under the Cadherin-5 promoter. We observe two phases of vascularization. First, rapid vessel sprouting pervades the FOV within 3-4 days after osteotomy. Second, the vessel network continues to be dynamically remodeled until the end of our observation time, 14 days after surgery. Limbostomy opens a unique set of opportunities and allows further insight on spatiotemporal aspects of bone marrow biology, for example, hematopoiesis, analysis of cellular niches, immunological memory, and vascularization in the bone marrow during health and disease.

However, little is known about the molecular features of hepatic metastases due to difficulty in obtaining fresh tissues and low tumor cellularity.ResultsWe conduct exome sequencing and RNA sequencing for synchronous surgically resected primary tumors and the paired hepatic metastases from 17 hepatic oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and validate our findings in specimens from 35 of such cases. The comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and gene expressions show high similarity between primary tumors and hepatic metastases. However, hepatic metastases also show unique characteristics, such as a higher degree of 3p21.1 loss, stronger abilities of proliferation, downregulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition activity, and metabolic rewiring. More interesting, altered tumor microenvironments are observed in hepatic metastases, especially a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating M2 macrophage and upregulation of complement cascade. Further experiments demonstrate that expression of C1q increases in primary tumors and hepatic metastases, C1q is mainly produced by M2 macrophage, and C1q promotes migration and invasion of PDAC cells.ConclusionTaken together, we find potential factors that contribute to different stages of PDAC metastasis. Our study broadens the understanding of molecular mechanisms driving PDAC metastasis.																	1474-760X					JAN 4	2021	22	1							4	10.1186/s13059-020-02222-w							WOS:000607079200004	33397441

Although the basement membrane (BM) is located at tissue interfaces, its mode of action in inter-tissue interactions remains poorly understood, mainly because the molecular and structural details of the BM at distinct inter-tissue interfaces remain unclear. By combining quantitative transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, we systematically identify the cellular origin, molecular identity and tissue distribution of extracellular matrix molecules in mouse hair follicles, and reveal that BM composition and architecture are exquisitely specialized for distinct inter-tissue interactions, including epithelial-fibroblast, epithelial-muscle and epithelial-nerve interactions. The epithelial-fibroblast interface, namely, hair germ-dermal papilla interface, makes asymmetrically organized side-specific heterogeneity in the BM, defined by the newly characterized interface, hook and mesh BMs. One component of these BMs, laminin alpha 5, is required for hair cycle regulation and hair germ-dermal papilla anchoring. Our study highlights the significance of BM heterogeneity in distinct inter-tissue interactions. The basement membrane is located at tissue interfaces, but how it mediates distinct inter-tissue interactions is unclear.

Given the heterogeneity of microsatellite-unstable CRCs, we wanted to see whether any MSI-associated molecular features are specifically associated with prognosis. Experimental Design: One hundred and nine MSI-high CRCs were typed for primary mismatch repair (MMR) defect and for secondary loss of MMR proteins. Frameshifts at seven target genes, mutations in the RAS pathway, and methylation at MLH1/CDKN2A promoters were also searched. The interplay of molecular findings with clinicopathologic features and patient survival was analyzed. Results: Of 84 MLH1-deficient CRCs, 31 (36.9%) had MSH3 and 11 (13.1%) had MSH6 loss (P < 0.001), biallelic frameshift mutations at mononucleotide repeats accounting for most (78%) MSH3 losses. As compared with MSH3-retaining cancers, MLH1-deficient tumors with MSH3 loss showed a higher number of mutated target genes (3.94 +/- 1.56 vs. 2.79 +/- 1.75; P = 0.001), absence of nodal involvement at pathology [ N0; OR, 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04-0.43, P < 0.001], and better disease-free survival (P = 0.06). No prognostic value was observed for KRAS status and for MLH1/CDKN2A promoter methylation. The association between MSH3 loss and N0 was confirmed in an independent cohort of 71 MLH1-deficient CRCs (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.83, P = 0.02). Conclusions: MLH1-deficient CRCs not expressing MSH3 have a more severe MSI, a lower rate of nodal involvement, and a better postsurgical outcome. Clin Cancer Res; 18(11); 3142-53. (C) 2012 AACR.

Lineage Identity and Location within the Dermis Determine the Function of Papillary and Reticular Fibroblasts in Human Skin	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY												Human skin dermis is composed of the superficial papillary dermis and the reticular dermis in the lower layers, which can easily be distinguished histologically. In vitro analyses of fibroblasts from explant cultures from superficial and lower dermal layers suggest that human skin comprises at least two fibroblast lineages with distinct morphology, expression profiles, and functions. However, while for mouse skin cell surface markers have been identified, allowing the isolation of pure populations of one lineage or the other via FACS, this has not been achieved for human skin fibroblasts. We have now discovered two cell surface markers that discriminate between papillary and reticular fibroblasts. While FAP thorn CD90 e cells display increased proliferative potential, express PDPN and NTN1, and cannot be differentiated into adipocytes, FAP e CD90 thorn fibroblasts express high levels of ACTA2, MGP, PPARg, and CD36 and readily undergo adipogenic differentiation, a hallmark of reticular fibroblasts. Flow cytometric analysis of fibroblasts isolated from superficial and lower layers of human dermis showed that FAP thorn CD90 e cells are enriched in the papillary dermis. Altogether, functional analysis and expression profiling confirms that FAP thorn CD90 e cells represent papillary fibroblasts, whereas FAP e CD90 thorn fibroblasts derive from the reticular lineage. Although papillary and reticular fibroblasts are enriched in the upper or lower dermis, respectively, they are not spatially restricted, and the microenvironment seems to affect their function.

J	Taheem, DK; Jell, G; Gentleman, E				Taheem, Dheraj K.; Jell, Gavin; Gentleman, Eileen			Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha in Osteochondral Tissue Engineering	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART B-REVIEWS												Damage to osteochondral (OC) tissues can lead to pain, loss of motility, and progress to osteoarthritis. Tissue engineering approaches offer the possibility of replacing damaged tissues and restoring joint function; however, replicating the spatial and functional heterogeneity of native OC tissue remains a pressing challenge. Chondrocytes in healthy cartilage exist in relatively low-oxygen conditions, while osteoblasts in the underlying bone experience higher oxygen pressures. Such oxygen gradients also exist in the limb bud, where they influence OC tissue development. The cellular response to these spatial variations in oxygen pressure, which is mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway, plays a central role in regulating osteo- and chondrogenesis by directing progenitor cell differentiation and promoting and maintaining appropriate extracellular matrix production. Understanding the role of the HIF pathway in OC tissue development may enable new approaches to engineer OC tissue. In this review, we discuss strategies to spatially and temporarily regulate the HIF pathway in progenitor cells to create functional OC tissue for regenerative therapies. Impact statement Strategies to engineer osteochondral (OC) tissue are limited by the complex and varying microenvironmental conditions in native bone and cartilage. Indeed, native cartilage experiences low-oxygen conditions, while the underlying bone is relatively normoxic. The cellular response to these low-oxygen conditions, which is mediated through the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway, is known to promote and maintain the chondrocyte phenotype. By using tissue engineering scaffolds to spatially and temporally harness the HIF pathway, it may be possible to improve OC tissue engineering strategies for the regeneration of damaged cartilage and its underlying subchondral bone.

Therefore, it is characterized by several adaptive complex hallmarks. Among them, the pH dysregulation appears as a symbol of aberrant functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In comparison with normal tissues, in the solid tumors, we face with an irregular acidification and alkalinization of the extracellular and intracellular fluids. Methods: In this study, we comprehensively discussed the most recent reports on the hallmarks of solid tumors to provide deep insights upon the molecular machineries involved in the pH dysregulation of solid tumors and their impacts on the initiation and progression of cancer. Results: The dysregulation of pH in solid tumors is fundamentally related to the Warburg effect and hypoxia, leading to expression of a number of molecular machineries, including: NHE1, H+ pump V-ATPase, CA-9, CA-12, MCT-1, GLUT-1. Activation of proton exchangers and transporters (PETs) gives rise to formation of TME. This condition favors the cancer cells to evade from the anoikis and apoptosis, granting them aggressive and metastasis phenotype, as well as resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review aimed to discuss the key molecular changes of tumor cells in terms of bio-energetics and cancer metabolism in relation with pH dysregulation. During this phenomenon, the intra-and extracellular metabolites are altered and/or disrupted. Such molecular alterations provide molecular hallmarks for direct targeting of the PETs by potent relevant inhibitors in combination with conventional cancer therapies as ultimate therapy against solid tumors. Conclusion: Taken all, along with other treatment strategies, targeting the key molecular machineries related to intra-and extracellular metabolisms within the TME is proposed as a novel strategy to inhibit or block PETs that are involved in the pH dysregulation of solid tumors.

Molecular pathways and targets in prostate cancer	ONCOTARGET												Prostate cancer co-opts a unique set of cellular pathways in its initiation and progression. The heterogeneity of prostate cancers is evident at earlier stages, and has led to rigorous efforts to stratify the localized prostate cancers, so that progression to advanced stages could be predicted based upon salient features of the early disease. The deregulated androgen receptor signaling is undeniably most important in the progression of the majority of prostate tumors. It is perhaps because of the primacy of the androgen receptor governed transcriptional program in prostate epithelium cells that once this program is corrupted, the consequences of the ensuing changes in activity are pleotropic and could contribute to malignancy in multiple ways. Following localized surgical and radiation therapies, 20-40% of patients will relapse and progress, and will be treated with androgen deprivation therapies. The successful development of the new agents that inhibit androgen signaling has changed the progression free survival in hormone resistant disease, but this has not changed the almost ubiquitous development of truly resistant phenotypes in advanced prostate cancer. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular pathways involved in localized and metastatic prostate cancer, with an emphasis on the clinical implications of the new knowledge.																		1949-2553				SEP 15	2014	5	17					7217	7259		10.18632/oncotarget.2406							WOS:000348029800004	25277175

However, current understanding of the molecular basis of subclass conversion that is often involved in GBM recurrence remain rudimentary at best. Here we report that canonical Wnt signalling that is active in proneural (PN) but inactive in mesenchymal (MES) GBM, along with miR-125b and miR-20b that are expressed at high levels in PN compared with MES GBM, comprise a regulatory circuit involving TCF4-miR-125b/miR-20b-FZD6. FZD6 acts as a negative regulator of this circuit by activating CaMKII-TAK1-NLK signalling, which, in turn, attenuates Wnt pathway activity while promoting STAT3 and NF-kappa B signalling that are important regulators of the MES-associated phenotype. These findings are confirmed by targeting differentially enriched pathways in PN versus MES GBM that results in inhibition of distinct GBM subtypes. Correlative expressions of the components of this circuit are prognostic relevant for clinical GBM. Our findings provide insights for understanding GBM pathogenesis and for improving treatment of GBM.

The human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 was subcutaneously xenotransplanted into SCID recipients and stromal formation was analyzed on day 14 and on day 28. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies revealed that BM-derived endothelial cells (X-gal/CD31 or H-2b/CD31 double-positive cells) and myofibroblasts (X-gal/alpha-smooth muscle actin or H-2b/alpha-smooth muscle actin double-positive cells) were present within and around the cancer nests. On day 14, the frequencies of BM-derived endothelial cells and BM-derived myofibroblasts were 25.3+/-4.4% and 12.7+/-9.6%, respectively. On day 28, the frequency of BM-derived endothelial cells was 26.7+/-9.7% which was similar to the value on day 14. However, the frequency of BM-derived myofibroblasts was significantly higher (39.8+/-17.1%) on day 28 than on day 14 (P<0.05). The topoisomerase IIalpha-positive ratio was 2.2+/-1.2% for the H-2b-positive myofibroblasts, as opposed to only 0.3+/-0.4% for the H-2b-negative myofibroblasts, significant proliferative activity was observed in the BM-derived myofibroblasts (P<0.05). Our results indicate that BM-derived myofibroblasts become a major component of cancer-induced stromal cells in the later stage of tumor development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, non-functionalized (KIT-6) and aminopropyl-functionalized cubic Ia3d mesoporous silica ([n-PrNH2-KIT-6]) nanoparticles were used as nanoporous supports. Aminopropyl-functionalized mesoporous nanoparticles exhibited more potential candidates for BLG-B adsorption and minimum BLG leaching than non-functionalized nanoparticles. It was observed that the amount of adsorbed BLG is dependent on the initial BLG concentration for both KIT-6 and [n-PrNH2-KIT-6] mesoporous nanoparticles. Also larger amounts of BLG-B on KIT-6 was immobilized upon raising the temperature of the medium from 4 to 55 degrees C while such increase was undetectable in the case of immobilization of BLG-B on the [n-PrNH2-KIT-6]. At temperatures above 55 degrees C the amounts of adsorbed BLG on both studied nanomaterials decreased significantly. By Differential scanning calorimetry or DSC analysis the heterogeneity of the protein solution and increase in Tm may indicate that immobilization of BLG-B onto the modified KIT-6 results in higher thermal stability compared to unmodified one. The obtained results provide several crucial factors in determining the mechanism(s) of protein adsorption and stability on the nanostructured solid supports and the development of engineered nano-biomaterials for controlled drug-delivery systems and biomimetic interfaces for the immobilization of living cells.

Understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the migration of the cells in a complex environment is a key step towards successful anti-metastatic treatment. Using experimental data-based modeling, we focus on the fundamentals of metastatic invasion: motility, invasion, proliferation and metabolism, and study how they may be combined to maximize the cancer's ability to metastasize. The modeled cells' performance is measured by the number of cells that succeed in migration in a maze, which mimics the extracellular environment. We show that co-existence of different cell clones in the tumor, as often found in experiments, optimizes the invasive ability in a frequently-changing environment. We study the role of metabolism and stimulation by growth factors, and show that metabolism plays a crucial role in the metastatic process and should therefore be targeted for successful treatment.

The study of molecular subtype classifications may lead to improved prognostic classification and identification of new therapeutic targets. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtype classification has mainly been applied in U.S. clinical trials, while the intrinsic glioma subtype (IGS) has mainly been applied in European trials. Experimental Design: From paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 432 patients with uniformly treated, newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we built tissue microarrays for IHC analysis and applied RNA sequencing to the best samples to classify them according to TCGA and IGS subtypes. Results: We obtained transcriptomic results from 124 patients. There was a lack of agreement among the three TCGA classificatory algorithms employed, which was not solely attributable to intratumoral heterogeneity. There was overlapping of TCGA mesenchymal subtype with IGS cluster 23 and of TCGA classical subtype with IGS cluster 18. Molecular subtypes were not associated with prognosis, but levels of expression of 13 novel genes were identified as independent prognostic markers in glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype-negative patients, independently of clinical factors and MGMT methylation. These findings were validated in at least one external database. Three of the 13 genes were selected for IHC validation. In particular, high ZNF7 RNA expression and low ZNF7 protein expression were strongly associated with longer survival, independently of molecular subtypes. Conclusions: TCGA and IGS molecular classifications of glioblastoma have no higher prognostic value than individual genes and should be refined before being applied to clinical trials.

In certain circumstances, however, differentiated cells can display plasticity by changing their identity, either by dedifferentiation to a progenitor-like state or by transdifferentiation to an alternative differentiated cell type. Such cellular plasticity can be triggered by physiological or oncogenic stress, or it can be experimentally induced through cellular reprogramming. Notably, physiological stresses that promote plasticity, such as severe tissue damage, inflammation, or senescence, also represent hallmarks of cancer. Furthermore, key drivers of cellular plasticity include major oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways and can be exacerbated by drug treatment. Thus, plasticity may help cancer cells evade detection and treatment. We propose that cancer can be considered as a disease of excess plasticity, a notion that has important implications for intervention and treatment.

SIU-ICUD consultation on bladder cancer: basic science	WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY												PurposeTo provide a condensed summary of the Basic Science chapter that was included in the Third International Consultation on Bladder Cancer.MethodsWorld bladder cancer basic science experts used the published literature to create summaries of recent progress in their areas of expertise.ResultsThe completion of several large-scale genomics projects coupled with a strong collaborative culture within the research community and the exciting clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockade have combined to transform the bladder cancer research landscape. Bladder cancer molecular subtypes and the presence of specific DNA alterations provide important information about disease heterogeneity that has direct implications for clinical management, and some can be targeted by compounds that are already clinically available. Tests are being developed that can measure many of these alterations non-invasively in peripheral blood or urine, raising confidence that they could be used as biomarkers for surveillance and monitoring the effects of local and systemic therapies.ConclusionsAlthough the bulk of the mechanistic work lies ahead, the genomics results have created a hypothesis-generating description of bladder cancer heterogeneity that has set the stage for deeper mechanistic studies, and they have already provided us with extremely attractive candidate biomarkers to guide clinical practice. Here, we will summarize the recent progress in basic bladder cancer research and highlight near-term opportunities for the future.																	0724-4983	1433-8726				JAN	2019	37	1					15	29		10.1007/s00345-018-2594-y							WOS:000457455800003	30547196

The compressive (380 +/- 40 kPa) and tensile modulus (18.2 +/- 0.9 MPa) of the PCL scaffolds were increased significantly when constructs were printed with a shifted design and circumferential strands mimicking the collagen organization in native tissue (p < 0.05). Presence of circumferentially aligned PCL strands also led to elongation and alignment of the human fibrochondrocytes. Gene expression of the cells in agarose (Ag), gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), and GelMA-Ag hydrogels was significantly higher than that of cells on the PCL scaffolds after a 21-day culture. GelMA exhibited the highest level of collagen type I (COL1A2) mRNA expression, while GelMA-Ag exhibited the highest level of aggrecan (AGO) expression (p < 0.001, compared to PCL). GelMA and GelMA-Ag exhibited a high level of collagen type II (COL2A1) expression (p < 0.05, compared to PCL). Anatomical scaffolds with circumferential PCL strands were impregnated with cell-loaded GelMA in the periphery and GelMA-Ag in the inner region. GelMA and GelMA-Ag hydrogels enhanced the production of COL 1 and COL 2 proteins after a 6-week culture (p < 0.05). COL 1 expression increased gradually towards the outer periphery, while COL 2 expression decreased. We were thus able to engineer an anatomical meniscus with a cartilage-like inner region and fibrocartilage-like outer region.

Isolation and chondroinduction of a dermis-isolated, aggrecan-sensitive subpopulation with high chondrogenic potential	ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM												Objective. To develop a process that yields tissue-engineered articular cartilage constructs from skin-derived cells. Methods. Dermis-isolated, aggrecan-sensitive (DIAS) cells were isolated using a modified rapid adherence process. The chondrogenic potential was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent. assay, and immunohistochemistry. Filamentous actin (F-actin) and vinculin organization was detected using fluorescence microscopy. Results. The rapid adherence process led to a selection of DIAS cells, < 10% of the entire population. DIAS cells displayed greater chondroinduction potential, as evidenced by the formation of large numbers of chondrocytic nodules on aggrecan-coated surfaces. In addition, these cells showed higher gene expression and protein production in terms of chondrocytic markers when compared with unpurified dermis cells. Similar patterns of F-actin and vinculin organization were observed between DIAS cells and chondrocytes. Three-dimensional constructs from chondroinduced DIAS cells produced greater amounts of cartilage matrix than constructs from the rest of the dermis populations. Conclusion. These findings show a series of steps that work together to form tissue-engineered articular cartilage constructs using DIAS cells. Since skin presents a minimally invasive, relatively abundant cell source for tissue engineering, this study offers evidence of an efficient and stable technique to form cartilage constructs for future cartilage regeneration with autologous cells from skin.

Recent studies have elucidated the potential role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in this function. TNTs are long, filamentous, actin-based cell protrusions that mediate direct cell-to-cell communication between malignant cells. In this study, we investigated the formation of TNTs in response to variable concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, which is used extensively in the treatment of cancer patients. Doxorubicin stimulated an increased formation of TNTs in pancreatic cancer cells, and this occurred in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, TNTs facilitated the intercellular redistribution of this drug between connected cells in both pancreatic and ovarian cancer systems in vitro. To provide supportive evidence for the relevance of TNTs in pancreatic cancer in vivo, we performed multiphoton fluorescence microscopy and imaged TNTs in tumor specimens resected from three human patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and one with neuroendocrine carcinoma. In sum, TNT formation was upregulated in aggressive forms of pancreatic carcinoma, was further stimulated after chemotherapy exposure, and acted as a novel method for drug efflux. These findings implicate TNTs as a potential novel mechanism of drug resistance in chemorefractory forms of cancer.

Cholangiocarcinoma 2020: the next horizon in mechanisms and management	NATURE REVIEWS GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY												Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) includes a cluster of highly heterogeneous biliary malignant tumours that can arise at any point of the biliary tree. Their incidence is increasing globally, currently accounting for similar to 15% of all primary liver cancers and similar to 3% of gastrointestinal malignancies. The silent presentation of these tumours combined with their highly aggressive nature and refractoriness to chemotherapy contribute to their alarming mortality, representing similar to 2% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide yearly. The current diagnosis of CCA by non-invasive approaches is not accurate enough, and histological confirmation is necessary. Furthermore, the high heterogeneity of CCAs at the genomic, epigenetic and molecular levels severely compromises the efficacy of the available therapies. In the past decade, increasing efforts have been made to understand the complexity of these tumours and to develop new diagnostic tools and therapies that might help to improve patient outcomes. In this expert Consensus Statement, which is endorsed by the European Network for the Study of Cholangiocarcinoma, we aim to summarize and critically discuss the latest advances in CCA, mostly focusing on classification, cells of origin, genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, molecular alterations, biomarker discovery and treatments. Furthermore, the horizon of CCA for the next decade from 2020 onwards is highlighted.

Tumor vasculogenic mimicry predicts poor prognosis in cancer patients: a meta-analysis	ANGIOGENESIS												Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is the formation of vascular channels by tumor cells or tumor cell-derived, trans-differentiated cells in highly aggressive, solid tumors. However, the disease features and prognostic value of VM for overall survival of cancer patients remain controversial. To systematically investigate the roles of VM in cancer progression and its prognostic values, we performed a meta-analysis based on 36 studies (33 eligible articles) including 3609 patients. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to assess the relationship between VM and overall survival in cancer patients. Vasculogenic mimicry was significantly associated with cancer differentiation, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. The prognostic value of VM was significant in overall survival (HR 2.16; 95 % CI 1.98-2.38; P < 0.001). Analyses stratified by confounders, such as cancer type, ethnicity, VM detection methods, sample size, and Newcastle-Ottawa quality score, found similar significant results. The presence of VM predicts poorer survival outcomes in cancer patients.																	0969-6970	1573-7209				APR	2016	19	2					191	200		10.1007/s10456-016-9500-2							WOS:000373178900007	26899730

Distinct fibroblast functional states drive clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer and are regulated by TCF21	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE												Recent studies indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. However, little is known about CAF subtypes, the roles they play in cancer progression, and molecular mediators of the CAF "state." Here, we identify a novel cell surface pan-CAF marker, CD49e, and demonstrate that two distinct CAF states, distinguished by expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), coexist within the CD49e(+) CAF compartment in high-grade serous ovarian cancers. We show for the first time that CAF state influences patient outcomes and that this is mediated by the ability of FAP-high, but not FAP-low, CAFs to aggressively promote proliferation, invasion and therapy resistance of cancer cells. Overexpression of the FAP-low-specific transcription factor TCF21 in FAP-high CAFs decreases their ability to promote invasion, chemoresistance, and in vivo tumor growth, indicating that it acts as a master regulator of the CAF state. Understanding CAF states in more detail could lead to better patient stratification and novel therapeutic strategies.

FUTURE ONCOLOGY												Breast cancer oncology represents one of the disciplines where personalized cancer medicine has been most actively pursued. The class-discovery studies conceptually advanced the field, underlining the molecular heterogeneity governing this common disease. The advent of high-throughput molecular profiling technologies holds great promise for the advance of all aspects of personalized cancer medicine, namely accurate prognostication, prediction of response to common systemic therapies and individualized monitoring of the disease. Moreover, an ever-expanding arsenal of targeted therapeutic compounds under clinical development, coupled with emerging powerful tools for comprehensive molecular and functional characterization, pose significant promise for improved clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients. Interrogation of the germline genetic variation offers further promise towards tailoring of breast cancer management. Well-conducted prospective validation studies are needed if breast cancer personalized therapy is to transform from a dream into a reality.																	1479-6694	1744-8301				AUG	2013	9	8					1105	1119		10.2217/FON.13.57							WOS:000329936300013	23902243

As a downstream target of TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B has an inhibition effect on the proliferation and differentiation of cells surrounding the lesion. As a negative effect, it leads to a reduction in bone growth and development. Methods: In this study, the small molecule NBD polypeptide and bone conduction matrix Sr-CaS are microspheres, formed to prepare Sr-CaS, NBD drug-loaded sustained-release microspheres in order to achieve a Sr-CaS/NBD peptide drug-loaded sustained release microsphere scaffold material (SP-Sr-CaS/NBD). We prepared the microspheres and optimized the production process to obtain particles with stable morphological properties and sustained release properties. Result: In vitro experiments demonstrated that SP-Sr-CaS/NBD could reduce TNF-alpha-induced cell growth inhibition, caspase-3 activity and NF-kappa B transcriptional activation as the function of continuous NBD peptide dosing regimen. Conclusion: Also, the introduction of the Sr-CaS matrix potentiates microspheres to promote cell proliferation and provides a basis to become a promising 3D bone scaffold material in the future.																	1567-2018	1875-5704					2021	18	4					433	445		10.2174/1567201817999201116154935							WOS:000669449100005	33198617

Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Experimental Stroke and Comparison With Histology Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	STROKE												Background and Purpose-Because the new era of preclinical stroke research demands improvements in validity and generalizability of findings, moving from single site to multicenter studies could be pivotal. However, the conduct of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in stroke remains ill-defined. We sought to assess the variability in the use of MRI for evaluating lesions post stroke and to examine the possibility as an alternative to gold standard histology for measuring the infarct size. Methods-We identified animal studies of ischemic stroke reporting lesion sizes using MRI. We assessed the degree of heterogeneity and reporting of scanning protocols, postprocessing methods, study design characteristics, and study quality. Studies performing histological evaluation of infarct size were further selected to compare with corresponding MRI using meta-regression. Results-Fifty-four articles undertaking a total of 78 different MRI scanning protocols met the inclusion criteria. T-2-weighted imaging was most frequently used (83% of the studies), followed by diffusion-weighted imaging (43%). Reporting of the imaging parameters was adequate, but heterogeneity between studies was high. Twelve studies assessed the infarct size using both MRI and histology at corresponding time points, with T-2-weighted imaging-based treatment effect having a significant positive correlation with histology ((R) over bar (2) = 0.699; P<0.001). Conclusions-Guidelines for standardized use and reporting of MRI in preclinical stroke are urgently needed. T-2-weighted imaging could be used as an effective in vivo alternative to histology for estimating treatment effects based on the extent of infarction; however, additional studies are needed to explore the effect of individual parameters.

Hypoxia Predicts Aggressive Growth and Spontaneous Metastasis Formation from Orthotopically Grown Primary Xenografts of Human Pancreatic Cancer	CANCER RESEARCH												Hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with treatment resistance and increased metastatic potential. Although hypoxia has been reported in pancreatic cancer patients, there is little direct evidence that this contributes to their overall poor prognosis. To address this, we examined the associations between hypoxia and biological aggression in a series of patient-derived xenografts grown orthotopically. Early passage xenografts were established from 16 patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer and maintained in the pancreas of immune-deprived mice. Hypoxic cells were labeled using the 2-nitroimidazole probe EF5 and stained for immunofluorescence microscopy of tissue sections or as cell suspensions for flow cytometry. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake, microvessel density, cleaved caspase-3, and the differentiation markers E-cadherin, cytokeratin 19, and vimentin were analyzed in relation to hypoxia. Orthotopic implants closely resembled the histology of the original surgical samples. The 16 primary xenografts showed a wide range in their growth rates and metastatic potential, reminiscent of the spectrum of behavior seen in the clinic. EF5 labeling, tumor growth rates, and metastatic patterns were highly consistent within replicates, indicating a significant transmissible (genetic or epigenetic) component. Hypoxia was highly correlated with rapid tumor growth, increased BrdUrd uptake, and with spontaneous metastasis formation. mRNA expression analysis showed increased expression of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in the hypoxic models. The results suggest that hypoxia is a major adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer patients and support the introduction of techniques to measure hypoxia directly in patients and the development of treatment protocols to target hypoxia.

Novel translational approaches to the search for precision therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome	LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE												In the 50 years since acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described, substantial progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for and the pathogenic contributors to the syndrome and in characterising the protein expression patterns in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS. Despite this effort, however, pharmacological options for ARDS remain scarce. Frequently cited reasons for this absence of specific drug therapies include the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS, the potential for a differential response to drugs, and the possibility that the wrong targets have been studied. Advances in applied biomolecular technology and bioinformatics have enabled breakthroughs for other complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma, particularly when a precision medicine paradigm, wherein a biomarker or gene expression pattern indicates a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment, has been pursued. In this Review, we consider the biological and analytical techniques that could facilitate a precision medicine approach for ARDS.																	2213-2600					JUN	2017	5	6					512	523		10.1016/S2213-2600(17)30187-X							WOS:000402091700022	28664850

Bioprinting of osteochondral tissues: A perspective on current gaps and future trends	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOPRINTING												Osteochondral tissue regeneration has remained a critical challenge in orthopaedic surgery, especially due to complications of arthritic degeneration arising out of mechanical dislocations of joints. The common gold standard of autografting has several limitations in presenting tissue engineering strategies to solve the unmet clinical need. However. due to the complexity of joint anatomy. and tissue heterogeneity at the interface, the conventional tissue engineering strategies have certain limitations. The advent of bioprinting has now provided new opportunities for osteochondral tissue engineering. Bioprinting can uniquely mimic the heterogeneous cellular composition and anisotropic extra-cellular matrix (ECM) organization, while allowing for targeted gene delivery to achieve heterotypic differentiation. In this perspective, we discuss the current advances made towards bioprinting of composite osteochondral tissues and present an account of challenges in terms of tissue integration, long-terin survival, and mechanical strength at the time of implantation required to be addressed for effective clinical translation of bioprinted tissues. Finally, we highlight some of the future trends related to osteochondral bioprinting with the hope of in-clinical translation.

Due to the high cost of current treatment strategies, there is a crucial unmet need to develop inexpensive preclinical platforms to accelerate the process of anti-cancer drug discovery to improve outcomes in cancer patients, most especially in female patients. Many current methods employ expensive animal models which not only present ethical concerns but also do not often accurately predict human physiology and the outcomes of anti-cancer drug responsiveness. Conventional treatment approaches for cancer generally include systemic therapy after a surgical procedure. Although this treatment technique is effective, the outcome is not always positive due to various complex factors such as intratumor heterogeneity and confounding factors within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Patients who develop metastatic disease still have poor prognosis. To that end, recent efforts have attempted to use 3D microengineered platforms to enhance the predictive power and efficacy of anti-cancer drug screening, ultimately to develop personalized therapies. Fascinating features of microengineered assays, such as microfluidics, have led to the advancement in the development of the tumor-on-chip technology platforms, which have shown tremendous potential for meaningful and physiologically relevant anti-cancer drug discovery and screening. Three dimensional microscale models provide unprecedented ability to unveil the biological complexities of cancer and shed light into the mechanism of anti-cancer drug resistance in a timely and resource efficient manner. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the development of microengineered tumor models for anti-cancer drug discovery and screening in female-related cancers. We specifically focus on female-related cancers to draw attention to the various approaches being taken to improve the survival rate of women diagnosed with cancers caused by sex disparities. We also briefly discuss other cancer types like colon adenocarcinomas and glioblastoma due to their high rate of occurrence in females, as well as the high likelihood of sex-biased mutations which complicate current treatment strategies for women. We highlight recent advances in the development of 3D microscale platforms including 3D tumor spheroids, microfluidic platforms as well as bioprinted models, and discuss how they have been utilized to address major challenges in the process of drug discovery, such as chemoresistance, intratumor heterogeneity, drug toxicity, etc. We also present the potential of these platform technologies for use in high-throughput drug screening approaches as a replacements of conventional assays. Within each section, we will provide our perspectives on advantages of the discussed platform technologies.																	0090-6964	1573-9686				AUG	2021	49	8			SI		1943	1972		10.1007/s10439-020-02704-9		JAN 2021					WOS:000605121900001	33403451

The health economic burden of osteoarthritis is increasing commensurate with obesity prevalence and longevity. Osteoarthritis has a strong genetic component but the success of previous genetic studies has been restricted due to insufficient sample sizes and phenotype heterogeneity. Methods We undertook a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 7410 unrelated and retrospectively and prospectively selected patients with severe osteoarthritis in the arcOGEN study, 80% of whom had undergone total joint replacement, and 11 009 unrelated controls from the UK. We replicated the most promising signals in an independent set of up to 7473 cases and 42 938 controls, from studies in Iceland, Estonia, the Netherlands, and the UK. All patients and controls were of European descent. Findings We identified five genome-wide significant loci (binomial test p <= 5.0x10(-8)) for association with osteoarthritis and three loci just below this threshold. The strongest association was on chromosome 3 with rs6976 (odds ratio 1.12 [95% CI 1.08-1.16]; p=7.24x10(-11)), which is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs11177. This SNP encodes a missense polymorphism within the nucleostemin-encoding gene GNL3. Levels of nucleostemin were raised in chondrocytes from patients with osteoarthritis in functional studies. Other significant loci were on chromosome 9 close to ASTN2, chromosome 6 between FILIP1 and SENP6, chromosome 12 close to KLHDC5 and PTHLH, and in another region of chromosome 12 close to CHST11. One of the signals close to genome-wide significance was within the FTO gene, which is involved in regulation of bodyweight-a strong risk factor for osteoarthritis. All risk variants were common in frequency and exerted small effects. Interpretation Our findings provide insight into the genetics of arthritis and identify new pathways that might be amenable to future therapeutic intervention.				mangino, massimo/F-5134-2011; Perica, Vesna Boraska/D-8230-2017; Meulenbelt, Ingrid/F-4756-2011; Rivadeneira, Fernando/O-5385-2015; Houwing-Duistermaat, Jeanne/V-9048-2018; yadav, VIJAY k/Q-2540-2016; Evangelou, Evangelos/C-3033-2013; Deloukas, Panos/B-2922-2013; Bos, Steffan D/L-7896-2016; Slagboom, P.

We quantified placental DNAm using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. We assessed associations between DNAm at single-CpGs and skinfold thickness using robust linear regression models adjusted for gestational age, child's sex, age at follow-up and cellular heterogeneity. We sought replication of DNAm association with child adiposity in an independent cohort. We quantified placental mRNA levels for annotated gene using qRT-PCR and tested for correlation with DNAm. Lower DNAm at cg22593959 and cg22436429 was associated with higher adiposity (beta = -1.18, q = 0.002 and beta = -0.82, q = 0.04). The cg22593959 is located in an intergenic region (chr7q31.3), whereas cg22436429 is within the TFAP2E gene (1p34.3). DNAm at cg22593959 and cg22436429 was correlated with mRNA levels at FAM3C (r(s) = -0.279, p = 0.005) and TFAP2E (r(s) = 0.216, p = 0.03). In an independent cohort, the association between placental DNAm at cg22593959 and childhood adiposity was of similar strength and direction (beta = -3.8 +/- 4.1, p = 0.36), yet non-significant. Four genomic regions were also associated with skinfold thickness within FMN1, MAGI2, SKAP2 and BMPR1B genes. We identified placental epigenetic variations associated with adiposity at 3 years of age suggesting that childhood fat accretion patterns might be established during fetal life.

We assessed the efficacy of CD compared with all other JPT in delaying the natural osteonecrosis evolution to HOA. Sources of data: Following the PRISMA checklist, the Medline and Scopus databases were searched. Fifteen-to 70-year-old subjects with ONFH with a minimum follow-up of 24 months were considered. The outcomes evaluated were patient clinical status, radiographic progression and total hip arthroplasty (THA) or further surgery (FS) need. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated for every outcome reported. RCT, CCT and prospective studies were included. Areas of agreement: A total of 12 studies (776 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Clinical outcome (RR = 1.14; 95% CI 0.58-2.32; P = 0.05), radiographic progression (RR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.14-2.35; P = 0.05) and the need for THA/FS (RR = 1.52; 95% CI 0.95-2.45; P = 0.05) suggested a slight superiority of other JPT compared with CD. Areas of controversy: High heterogeneity of the primary investigations was the main limitation of our study. Growing points: The efficacy and effectiveness of core decompression for ONFH are, at best, no better than other joint preserving strategies. The more recent scientific evidence seems to suggest that such procedure is less successful than other joint preserving strategies. Areas timely for developing research: Further studies are needed to identify the best therapeutic approach to the ONFH.

Although a subset of marrow explants ossifies in vitro without excipient osteoinductive factors, some explants do not undergo ossification. The disparity of outcome suggests a significant heterogeneity in marrow tissue in terms of its capacity to undergo osteogenesis. We sought to identify: (1) proteins and signaling pathways associated with osteogenesis by contrasting the proteomes of ossified and poorly ossified marrow explants; and (2) temporal changes in proteome and signaling pathways of marrow ossification in the early and late phases of bone formation. Explants of marrow were cultured. Media conditioned by ossified (n = 4) and poorly ossified (n = 4) subsets were collected and proteins unique to each group were identified by proteomic analysis. Proteomic data were processed to assess proteins specific to the early phase (Days 1-14) and late phase (Days 15-28) of the culture period. Pathways involved in bone marrow ossification were identified through bioinformatics. Twenty-eight proteins were unique to ossified samples and eight were unique to poorly ossified ones. Twelve proteins were expressed during the early phase and 15 proteins were specific to the late phase. Several identified pathways corroborated those reported for bone formation in the literature. Immune and inflammatory pathways were specific to ossified samples. The marrow explant model indicates the inflammatory and immune pathways to be an integral part of the osteogenesis process. These results align with the clinically reported negative effects of antiinflammatory agents on fracture healing.

In breast tumors, aberrant DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic feature associated with increased risk of metastasis and poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia alters DNA methylation or other epigenetic controls that promote breast malignancy remains poorly understood. We discovered that hypoxia deregulates TET1 and TET3, the enzymes that catalyze conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thereby leading to breast tumor-initiating cell (BTIC) properties. TET1/3 and 5hmC levels were closely associated with tumor hypoxia, tumor malignancy, and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Mechanistic investigations showed that hypoxia leads to genome-wide changes in DNA hydroxymethylation associated with upregulation of TNFa expression and activation of its downstream p38-MAPK effector pathway. Coordinate functions of TET1 and TET3 were also required to activate TNFa-p38-MAPK signaling as a response to hypoxia. Our results reveal how signal transduction through the TET-TNFa-p38-MAPK signaling axis is required for the acquisition of BTIC characteristics and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, with potential implications for how to eradicate BTIC as a therapeutic strategy.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively examined 52 patients with LARC (cT3-4, Nany, M0) who received oxaliplatin-based NAC before surgery. CD133 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and divided into low and high expression groups. Results: High CD133 expression was observed in 22 patients (42.3%). Patients with high CD133 expression had more frequent vessel invasion and relapse than those with low CD133 expression (p=0.013 and p=0.036, respectively). Comparing the low with high CD133 expression groups, the 4-year relapse-free survival rates were 82.2% vs. 46.3% (p=0.009). Multivariate analysis indicated that CD133 expression was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR= 3.138; 95%CI=1.046-9.412; p=0.041). Conclusion: CD133 expression may be a predictive biomarker for postoperative relapse in patients with LARC who received NAC before surgery.																	0258-851X	1791-7549				JAN-FEB	2021	35	1					437	445		10.21873/invivo.12276							WOS:000607297400008	33402494
