S	Wang, WQ; Han, ZC		Birbrair, A		Wang, Weiqiang; Han, Zhong Chao			Heterogeneity of Human Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells	STEM CELLS HETEROGENEITY - NOVEL CONCEPTS	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Increasing evidence has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from body tissues are heterogeneous while being examined in vitro and in vivo. Besides some common characteristics, MSCs derived from different tissues exhibit unique biological properties. In addition, the therapeutic effects of MSCs may vary widely due to their heterogeneity and the technical differences in large-scale ex vivo expansion. In this chapter, the heterogeneity of MSCs will be discussed in three levels: the individual donors, the tissue sources, and the cell surface markers.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-11096-3; 978-3-030-11095-6				2019	1123						165	177		10.1007/978-3-030-11096-3_10	10.1007/978-3-030-11096-3						WOS:000471743600011	31016600					
J	Phinney, DG				Phinney, Donald G.			Functional heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells: Implications for cell therapy	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY												The term mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) was adopted in the 1990s to describe a population of bone-marrow-derived cells that demonstrated the capacity for tri-lineage differentiation at a clonal level. Research conducted during the ensuing decades has demonstrated that MSCs fulfill many functions in addition to connective tissue progenitors including contributing to the HSC niche and regulating the function of immune effector cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system. Despite these advances, fundamental aspects of MSC biology remain indeterminate. For example, the embryonic origin of MSCs and their niche in vivo remains a highly debated topic. More importantly, the mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and lineage specification have also been largely unexplored. The later is significant in that MSC population's exhibit considerable donor-to-donor and intra-population heterogeneity but knowledge regarding how different functional attributes of MSCs are specified at the population level is unknown. This poses significant obstacles in research and in efforts to develop clinical manufacturing protocols that reproducibly generate functionally equivalent MSC populations. Herein, I discuss data demonstrating that MSC populations are intrinsically heterogeneous, elaborate on the molecular basis for this heterogeneity, and discuss how heterogeneity impacts clinical manufacturing and the therapeutic potency of MSCs.

However, cellular heterogeneity limits MSCs in the consistency and efficacy of their clinical applications. Metabolism regulates stem cell function and fate decision; however, how metabolites regulate the functional heterogeneity of MSCs remains elusive. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we discovered that fatty acid pathways are involved in the regulation of lineage commitment and functional heterogeneity of MSCs. Functional assays showed that a fatty acid metabolite, butyrate, suppressed the self-renewal, adipogenesis, and osteogenesis differentiation potential of MSCs with increased apoptosis. Conversely, butyrate supplement significantly promoted HSC niche factor expression in MSCs, which suggests that butyrate supplement may provide a therapeutic approach to enhance their HSC niche function. Overall, our work demonstrates that metabolites are essential to regulate the functional heterogeneity of MSCs.

Cardiomyogenic Heterogeneity of Clonal Subpopulations of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells	JOURNAL OF STEM CELLS & REGENERATIVE MEDICINE												We have evaluated the cardiomyogenic potential clonal populations of human bone marrow mesenchymal;stem cells (BM-MSC). Four rapidly proliferating clones of BM-MSC were obtained from the BM of a healthy donor which were then treated with 5-azacytidine and evaluated for the expression of GATA-4, NKx-2.5, FOG-2, TDGF-1, beta-MHC, MEF2D and NPPA genes and cTnT, Desmin and beta-MHC proteins. Of the four clones (i) Clone-1 had high expression of GATA-4 (1.89 fold (p<0.05), Nkx2.5 (2.29 fold; p<0.05), FOG2 (2.76 fold; p<0.05), TDGF1 (6.97 fold, p<0.005), beta MHC (10.22 fold; p<0.005), MEF-2D (1.91 fold; p<0.005) and NPPA (1.65 fold; p<0.005); (ii) clone-2 had up-regulation of Nkx2.5 (1.98 fold; p<0.05) but down-regulation of rest of the genes; (iii) clone-3 had up-regulation of Nkx2.5 (2.11 fold; p<0.05), TDGF1 (1.88 fold; p<0.05), MEF-2D (1.30 fold; p<0.05) and NPPA (1.21 fold; p<0,05), down regulation of GATA-4 and Fog-2 but no change in beta MHC gene; and (iv) clone-4 had up-regulation of MEF-2D (1.17 fold; p<0.05) and down regulation of GATA-4, Nkx2.5 but no change in other genes compared to untreated cells of the clones. At the protein level clone-1 expressed cTnT, Desmin, and beta MHC; clone-2 Desmin only while clones-3 and 4 each expressed cTnT, Desmin, and beta MHC. Our data shows that BM-MSC are a heterogenous population of stem cells with sub-populations exhibiting a marked difference in the expression of cardiac markers both at gene and protein levels. This highlights that administering selected sub-populations of BM-MSC with a cardiomyogenic potential may be more efficacious than whole population of cells for cardiac regeneration.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and neural progenitor cells (NPC) are pluripotent cells. The former can give rise to myocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteogenic cells, while the latter can give rise to astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the antigen expression patterns of MSC and NPC. Design and Methods. Human bone marrow-derived MSC and NPC were analyzed. by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry using a variety of unique monoclonal antibodies (57D2, W4A5, W8B2) generated in our laboratory. In addition, the expression profile of CD antigens and intracellular differentiation markers was analyzed. Results. We show for the first time that CD10(+), CD13(+), CD61(+), CD90(+), CD105 (endoglin)(+), CD45(-), CD34(-), and CD133(-) MSC also expressed CD109, CD140b (PDGFRB), CD 164, and CD 172a (SIRPalpha). In addition, we found heterogeneity of MSC as demonstrated by the preferential expression of nestin and W8B2 antigen on distinct MSC subpopulations. Morphologically, these populations comprised small single cells and larger cells with polygonal appearance. NPC expressed high levels of CD56, CD90 and nestin and moderate levels of CD15, W4A5, and 57D2 antigens. In contrast, CD133 and CD172 were found only on NPC subpopulations. Interpretation and Conclusions. Our data demonstrate nestin expression in most NPC as well as in immature MSC subpopulations. MSC and NPC subpopulations can now be distinguished using our novel antibodies W8B2, 57D2, and W4A5.																	0390-6078					FEB	2003	88	2					126	133									WOS:000181037700005	12604402

We here study the expression of the membrane stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) clones. We show that subpopulations with varying Sca-1 expression profiles regenerate the Sca-1 profile of the mother population within a few days. However, after extensive replication in vitro, the expression profiles shift to lower values and the regeneration time increases. Study of the promoter of Ly delta a unravels that the expression level of Sca-1 is related to the promoter occupancy by the activating histone mark H3K4me3. We demonstrate that these findings can be consistently explained by a computational model that considers positive feedback between promoter H3K4me3 modification and gene transcription. This feedback implicates bistable epigenetic states which the cells occupy with an age-dependent frequency due to persistent histone (de-) modification. Our results provide evidence that MSC heterogeneity, and presumably that of other stem cells, is associated with bistable epigenetic states and suggest that MSCs are subject to permanent state fluctuations.

The objective of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of different subpopulations of hMSC by testing the hypothesis that the clonogenic hMSC subpopulation, which is selectively enriched in clonal density (CD) and low density (LD) culture (10 and 100 cells per square centimeter, respectively), possesses a metabolic phenotype that differs from that of hMSC in medium-or high-density (MD: 1,000 and HD: 3,000 cells per square centimeter, respectively). Cells at CD and LD conditions exhibited elevated expression of CD146 and colony forming unit-fibroblast compared with cells at MD-or HD. Global metabolic profiles revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of cell extracts showed clear distinction between LD and HD cultures, and density-dependent differences in coupling of glycolysis to the TCA cycle. Metabolic inhibitors revealed density-dependent differences in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for ATP generation, in glutamine metabolism, in the dependence on the pentose phosphate pathway for maintaining cellular redox state, and sensitivity to exogenous reactive oxygen species. We also show that active OXPHOS is not required for proliferation in LD culture but that OXPHOS activity increases senescence in HD culture. Together, the results revealed heterogeneity in hMSC culture exists at the level of primary metabolism. The unique metabolic characteristics of the clonogenic subpopulation suggest a novel approach for optimizing in vitro expansion of hMSCs.

Potential conflation of MSC properties with those of tissue-derived stromal cells presents difficulties in comparing study outcomes and represents a source of confusion in cell therapy development. Cultured MSCs demonstrate significant heterogeneity in clonogenicity and multi-lineage differentiation potential. However in vivo biology of MSCs includes native functions unrelated to regenerative medicine applications, so do nomenclature and heterogeneity matter? In this perspective we examine some consequences of the nomenclature debate and heterogeneity of MSCs. Regulatory expectations are considered, emphasizing that product development should prioritize detailed characterization of therapeutic cell populations for specific indications.

Small Molecule Mesengenic Induction of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells to Generate Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												The translational potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) is limited by their rarity in somatic organs, heterogeneity, and need for harvest by invasive procedures. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be an advantageous source of MSCs, but attempts to derive MSCs from pluripotent cells have required cumbersome or untranslatable techniques, such as coculture, physical manipulation, sorting, or viral transduction. We devised a single-step method to direct mesengenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs using a small molecule inhibitor. First, epithelial-like monolayer cells were generated by culturing ESCs/iPSCs in serum-free medium containing the transforming growth factor-beta pathway inhibitor SB431542. After 10 days, iPSCs showed upregulation of mesodermal genes (MSX2, NCAM, HOXA2) and downregulation of pluripotency genes (OCT4, LEFTY1/2). Differentiation was then completed by transferring cells into conventional MSC medium. The resultant development of MSC-like morphology was associated with increased expression of genes, reflecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Both ESC- and iPSC-derived MSCs exhibited a typical MSC immunophenotype, expressed high levels of vimentin and N-cadherin, and lacked expression of pluripotency markers at the protein level. Robust osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation was induced in vitro in ES-MSCs and iPS-MSCs, whereas adipogenic differentiation was limited, as reported for primitive fetal MSCs and ES-MSCs derived by other methods. We conclude that treatment with SB431542 in two-dimensional cultures followed by culture-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to rapid and uniform MSC conversion of human pluripotent cells without the need for embryoid body formation or feeder cell coculture, providing a robust, clinically applicable, and efficient system for generating MSCs from human iPSCs.

However, this progenitor property is not shared by all cells within the MSC population. Furthermore, MSCs exhibit variability in their phenotypes, including proliferation capacity, expression of cell surface markers and ability to secrete cytokines. These facts raise three major questions: (1) Does the in vitro observed variability reflect the existence of MSC subsets in vivo? (2) What is the molecular basis of the in vitro observed heterogeneity? and (3) What is the biological significance of this variability? This review considers the possibility that the variable nature of MSC populations contributes to the capacity of adult mammalian tissues to adapt to varying microenvironmental demands.																	1550-8943	1558-6804				SEP	2011	7	3					560	568		10.1007/s12015-011-9229-7							WOS:000292835000010	21437576

To establish human iPSCs as a potential source of viable chondroprogenitors for articular cartilage repair, we assessed the in vitro chondrogenic potential of the pluripotent population versus an iPSC-derived mesenchymal-like progenitor population. We found the direct plating of undifferentiated iPSCs into high-density micromass cultures in the presence of BMP-2 promoted chondrogenic differentiation, however these conditions resulted in a mixed population of cells resembling the phenotype of articular cartilage, transient cartilage, and fibrocartilage. The progenitor cells derived from human iPSCs exhibited immunophenotypic features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and developed along multiple mesenchymal lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. The data indicate the derivation of a mesenchymal stem cell population from human iPSCs is necessary to limit culture heterogeneity as well as chondrocyte maturation in the differentiated progeny. Moreover, as compared to pellet culture differentiation, BMP-2 treatment of iPSC-derived MSC-like (iPSCMSC) micromass cultures resulted in a phenotype more typical of articular chondrocytes, characterized by the enrichment of cartilage-specific type II collagen (Col2a1), decreased expression of type I collagen (Col1a1) as well as lack of chondrocyte hypertrophy. These studies represent a first step toward identifying the most suitable iPSC progeny for developing cell-based approaches to repair joint cartilage damage. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 480490, 2013.

While many of these investigations are for immune-mediated disorders, there is no established consensus on how to optimize the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs.

As such, sarcomas are by definition very heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity does not manifest only upon intertumoral comparison on a bulk tumor level but can be extended to intratumoral level. Whereas part of this intratumoral heterogeneity could be understood in terms of clonal genetic evolution, an essential part includes a hierarchical relationship between sarcoma cells, governed by both genetic and epigenetic influences, signals that sarcoma cells are exposed to, and intrinsic developmental programs derived from sarcoma cells of origin. The notion of this functional hierarchy operating within each tumor implies the existence of sarcoma stem cells, which may originate from mesenchymal stem cells, and indeed, mesenchymal stem cells have been used to establish several crucial experimental sarcoma models and to trace down their respective stem cell populations. Mesenchymal stem cells themselves are heterogeneous, and, moreover, there are alternative possibilities for sarcoma cells of origin, like neural crest-derived stem cells, or mesenchymal committed precursor cells, or - in rhabdomyosarcoma - muscle satellite cells. These various origins result in substantial heterogeneity in possible sarcoma initiation. Genetic and epigenetic changes associated with sarcomagenesis profoundly impact the biology of sarcoma stem cells. For pediatric sarcomas featuring discrete reciprocal translocations and largely stable karyotypes, the translocation- activated - oncogenes could be crucial factors that confer stemness, principally by modifying transcriptome and interfering with normal epigenetic regulation; the most extensively studied examples of this process are myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. For adult sarcomas, which have typically complex and unstable karyotypes, stemness might be defined more operationally, as a reflection of actual assembly of genetically and epigenetically conditioned stemness factors, with dedifferentiated liposarcoma providing a most thoroughly studied example. Alternatively, stemness can be imposed by tumor microenvironment, as extensively documented in osteosarcoma. In spite of this heterogeneity in both sarcoma initiation and underlying stemness biology, some of the molecular mechanisms of stemness might be remarkably similar in diverse sarcoma types, like abrogation of classical tumor suppressors pRb and p53, activation of Sox-2, or inhibition of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Moreover, even some stem cell markers initially characterized for their stem cell enrichment capacity in various carcinomas or leukemias seem to function quite similarly in various sarcomas. Understanding the biology of sarcoma stem cells could significantly improve sarcoma patient clinical care, leading to both better patient stratification and, hopefully, development of more effective therapeutic options.

During the process of expansion, some obstacles remain to be overcome. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of storage solutions and heterogeneity on the behavior of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Methods Umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs) of similar sizes within normal ranges were suspended in three different storage solutions, phosphate buffer solution, normal saline, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. Then, the ultrastructure, viability, and safety of these cells were compared. Other two UC-MSC populations of different sizes were categorized based on their mean diameters. The ultrastructure, proliferation, immunosuppression, hepatic differentiation potential, and number of senescent cells were investigated and compared. The survival rates of mice after the infusion of UC-MSCs of different sizes were compared. Results For UC-MSCs suspended in different storage solutions, the cell apoptosis rates, ultrastructure, and survival rates of mice were similar, and no differences were observed. Cells with a diameter of 19.14 +/- 4.89 mu m were categorized as the larger UC-MSC population, and cells with a diameter of 15.58 +/- 3.81 mu m were categorized as the smaller population. The mean diameter of the larger UC-MSC population was significantly larger than that of the smaller UC-MSC population (p < 0.01). Smaller UC-MSCs had more powerful proliferation and immunosuppressive potential and a higher nucleus-cytoplasm ratio than those of large UC-MSCs. The number of cells positive for beta-galactosidase staining was higher in the larger UC-MSC population than in the smaller UC-MSC population. The survival rates of mice receiving 1 x 10(6) or 2 x 10(6) smaller UC-MSCs were 100%, both of which were higher than those of mice receiving the same amounts of larger UC-MSCs (p < 0.01). The cause of mouse death was explored and it was found that some larger UC-MSCs accumulated in the pulmonary capillary in dead mice. Conclusion Different storage solutions showed no significant effects on cell behavior, whereas heterogeneity was quite prevalent in MSC populations and might limit cells application. Hence, it is necessary to establish a more precise standardization for culture-expanded MSCs.																		1757-6512				JUL 13	2021	12	1							391	10.1186/s13287-021-02450-2							WOS:000675242000001	34256842

Sources, Identification, and Clinical Implications of Heterogeneity in Human Umbilical Cord Stem Cells	STEM CELLS HETEROGENEITY IN DIFFERENT ORGANS	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Heterogeneity among different subpopulations of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUCMSCs) lines is an ubiquitous phenomenon, with such variability being related to several factors including the identity of the individual donor, tissue source (Wharton's jelly vs. umbilical cord blood), culture conditions, as well as random variations in the cloning expansion process. In this chapter, we provide a general overview on the sources as well as available experimental techniques for proper identification of heterogeneity in hUCMSCs. Finally, we provide a brief discussion on the current scientific evidence regarding the potential superiority of subpopulations of hUCMSCs for specific clinical applications. Taking into account the exponential growth on the available experimental data on hUCMSCs in the past few years, this chapter is not intended to be comprehensive in nature, but rather is intended to provide a general overview about the central role which the topic of heterogeneity has in both basic science and clinical research in umbilical cord stem cells.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-24108-7; 978-3-030-24107-0				2019	1169						243	256		10.1007/978-3-030-24108-7_13	10.1007/978-3-030-24108-7						WOS:000514284100014	31487028					
J	Phinney, DG				Phinney, Donald G.			Biochemical heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cell populations - Clues to their therapeutic efficacy	CELL CYCLE												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were initially identified by their capacity to differentiate into connective tissue cell types. In the past decade MSCs were also shown to exhibit unexpected plasticity, which was thought to account for their broad therapeutic efficacy in animal models of disease and human clinical trials. More recent evidence indicates that their capacity to alter the microenvironment via secretion of soluble factors contributes more significantly than their plasticity in effecting tissue repair. However, the production by MSCs of a diverse array of trophic factors is inconsistent with their designation as stem cells, which by definition lie at the apex of a hierarchy of cellular differentiation and lineage specification. Analysis of the MSC transcriptome has led to the identification of sub populations that express a variety of regulatory proteins that function in angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, neural activities, and immunity and defense. These activities reflect the varied functions of distinct stromal subtypes in marrow that play important roles in tissue homeostasis. Evidence is provided that the biochemical heterogeneity of these subpopulations contributes more significantly to the therapeutic potential of MSCs than their stem-like characteristics.

New insights into the heterogeneity and functional diversity of human mesenchymal stem cells	BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING					6th China-France International Symposium on Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine / 1st Meeting of the France-China International CNRS Network (GDRI)	JUL 10-13, 2016	Nancy, FRANCE	France China Int CNRS Network, CeSMeR				Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being tested in several biological systems and clinical settings with the aim of exploring their therapeutic potentials for a variety of diseases. MSCs are also known to be heterogeneous populations with variable functions. In the context of this multidimensional complexity, a recurrent question is what source or population of MSCs is suitable for specific clinical indications. Here, we reported that the biological features of MSCs varied with the individual donor, the tissue source, the culture condition and the subpopulations. Placental chorionic villi (CV) derived MSCs exhibited superior activities of immunomodulation and pro-angiogenesis compared to MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM), adipose and umbilical cord (UC). We identified a subpopulation of CD106(VCAM-1)(+) MSCs, which are present richly in placental CV, moderately in BM, and lowly in adipose and UC. The CD106(+) MSCs possess significantly increased immunomodutory and pro-angiogenic activities compared to CD106(-)MSCs. Analysis of gene expression and cytokine secretion revealed that CD106(+) MSCs highly expressed several immnumodulatory and pro-angiogenic cytokines. Our data offer new insights on the identification and selection of suitable source or population of MSCs for clinical applications. Further efforts should be concentrated on standardizing methods which will ultimately allow the validation of MSC products with defined biomarkers as predictive of potency in suitable pre-clinical models and clinical settings.																	0959-2989	1878-3619					2017	28			1			S29	S45		10.3233/BME-171622							WOS:000416685800005	28372276

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of cell fusion between mesenchymal stem cells and the gastric epithelial cells in tumorigenesis. Methods: Cell fusion between cord blood mesenchymal stem cells and human gastric epithelial cells was performed in vitro. Cell scratch and transwell assays were performed to determine migration and invasion abilities of the hybrids. The expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins and genes were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and real time quantitative PCR. Tumorigenesis of the hybrids was evaluated through in vivo inoculation in nude mice. Results: Hybrids expressed the phenotypes of both donor cells. Aneuploidy was observed in 84.1% of cells. The hybrids showed increased proliferation, migration and invasion abilities compared with the parental cells. In addition, the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in the hybrids was significantly higher than that of the epithelial cells, and the mRNA expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes, Twist and Slug, in the hybrids was also increased compared with that of the parental epithelial cells. Furthermore, the hybrids formed masses of epithelial origin with glandular structures in BALB/c nude mice. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cell fusion between gastric epithelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells may result in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and malignant transformation.																	1471-2407					JAN 30	2015	15								24	10.1186/s12885-015-1027-1							WOS:000348813300001	25633122

In order to fulfill their clinical applications in context of precision medicine, however, more detailed molecular characterization of diverse subgroups and standardized scalable production of certain functional subgroups would be highly desired. Thus far, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSC (iMSC) seems to provide the unique opportunity to solve most obstacles that currently exist to prevent the broad application of MSC as an advanced medicinal product. The features of iMSC include their single cell clone origins, and defined and controllable cultural conditions for their derivation and proliferation. Still, comprehensive research of the molecular and functional heterogeneity of iMSC, just like MSC from any other tissue types, would be required. Furthered on previous efforts on iMSC differentiation and expansion platform and transcriptomic studies, advantages of single cell multi-omics analysis and other up-to-dated technologies would be taken in order to elucidate the molecular origin and regulation of heterogeneity and to obtain iMSC subgroups homogeneous enough for particular clinical conditions. In this perspective, the current obstacles in MSC applications, the advantages of iMSC over MSC and their implications for biological research and clinical applications will be discussed.</p>																	2296-634X					SEP 30	2021	9								716907	10.3389/fcell.2021.716907							WOS:000707757000001	34660579

The molecular underpinnings of differentiation remain largely undefined. In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular features of chemically induced osteogenesis from MSC isolated from human adipose tissue (human adipose MSCs, hAMSCs) using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We found that a near complete differentiation of osteogenic clusters from hAMSCs under a directional induction. Both groups of cells are heterogeneous, and some of the hAMSCs cells are intrinsically prepared for osteogenesis, while variant OS clusters seems in cooperation with a due division of the general function. We identified a set of genes related to cell stress response highly expressed during the differentiation. We also characterized a series of transitional transcriptional waves throughout the process from hAMSCs to osteoblast and specified the unique gene networks and epigenetic status as key markers of osteogenesis.					pan, xinghua/0000-0002-7421-8155												1066-5099	1549-4918				NOV	2021	39	11					1478	1488		10.1002/stem.3442		AUG 2021					WOS:000685681200001	34346140

Heterogeneity of Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: From Stromal Cells to Stem Cells and Vice Versa	TRANSPLANTATION					8th Beaune Seminar in Transplantation Research	JUN 12-13, 2008	Beaune, FRANCE					Discovered more than 40 years ago, the biological features of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were progressively compared first with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and, more recently, with embryonic stem cells (ESC). Although these comparisons have been crucial in helping to clarify their nature, there is now a robust amount of data indicating that MSC in vitro represent an independent and heterogeneous group of progenitors with distinct self-renewal properties and established differentiation potentials. However, research developments both in humans and animals have progressively revealed the limits that MSC may face in vivo. To recognize these issues and challenge MSC sternness may seem to be a step backward. Nevertheless, it might also represent the beginning of a phase in which the introduction of novel preclinical approaches could provide better characterization and standardization of the in vivo factors influencing cell engraftment and survival, allowing a more successful impact of mesenchymal progenitors in several clinical settings.

In order to support the widely diversified parenchymal cells and tissue organization, MSCs are characterized by a large degree of heterogeneity, although available analyses of molecular and transcriptional data do not provide clear evidence. We have isolated MSCs from high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HG-SOCs) and various normal tissues (N-MSCs), demonstrated their normal genotype and analyzed their transcriptional activity with respect to the large comprehensive FANTOM5 sample dataset. Our integrative analysis conducted against the extensive panel of primary cells and tissues of the FANTOM5 project allowed us to mark the HG-SOC-MSCs CAGE-seq transcriptional heterogeneity and to identify a cell-type-specific transcriptional activity showing a significant relationship with primary mesothelial cells. Our analysis shows that MSCs isolated from different tissues are highly heterogeneous. The mesothelial-related gene signature identified in this study supports the hypothesis that HG-SOC-MSCs are bona fide representatives of the ovarian district. This finding indicates that HG-SOC-MSCs could actually derive from the coelomic mesothelium, suggesting that they might be linked to the epithelial tumor through common embryological precursors.

Bone Marrow-Harvesting Technique Influences Functional Heterogeneity of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells and Cartilage Regeneration	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE												Background: Connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) from native bone marrow (BM) or their culture-expanded progeny, often referred to as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, represents a promising strategy for treatment of cartilage injuries. But the cartilage regeneration capacity of these cells remains unpredictable because of cell heterogeneity. Hypothesis: The harvest technique of BM may highly influence stem cell heterogeneity and, thus, cartilage formation because these cells have distinct spatial localization within BM from the same bone. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: CTPs obtained from the femur of patients undergoing total hip replacement by 2 harvest techniques-BM aspiration and BM collection-after bone rasping were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry and evaluated for chondrogenic ability. The spatial localization of different CTP subsets in BM was verified by immunohistochemistry. Results: Cells from the BM after rasping were significantly more chondrogenic than the donor-matched aspirate, whereas no notable difference in their osteogenic or adipogenic potential was observed. The authors then assessed whether distinct immunophenotypically defined CTP subsets were responsible for the different chondrogenic capacity. Cells directly isolated from BM after rasping contained a higher percentage (mean, 7.2-fold) of CD45-CD271+CD56+ CTPs as compared with BM aspirates. The presence of this subset in the harvested BM strongly correlated with chondrogenic ability, showing that CD271+CD56+ cells are enriched in chondroprogenitors. Furthermore, evaluation of these CTP subsets in BM revealed that CD271+CD56+ cells were localized in the bone-lining regions whereas CD271+CD56- cells were found in the perivascular regions. Since the iliac crest remains a frequent site of BM harvest for musculoskeletal regeneration, the authors also compared the spatial distribution of these subsets in trabeculae of femoral head and iliac crest and found CD271+CD56+ bone-lining cells in both tissues. Conclusion: Chondrogenically distinct CTP subsets have distinct spatial localization in BM; hence, the harvest technique of BM determines the efficiency of cartilage formation. Clinical Relevance: The harvest technique of BM may be of major importance in determining the clinical success of BM mesenchymal stem/stromal cells in cartilage repair.

MSCs exert immunosuppressive effects through direct contact or paracrine action. The paracrine functions of MSCs are at least partially mediated by exosomes, which are membrane vesicles, carrying abundant proteins, nucleic acids and other active molecules. MSC-exos have heterogeneity. The exosomes from different donors, tissues generations of MSCs carry different bioactive molecules. These cargos are transferred to recipient cells by endocytosis or binding to proteins on the receptor surface to mediate intercellular communication between different cell types and affect the functions of the recipient cells. Exosomes play an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-exos) carry immunomodulatory effectors or transmit active signal molecules to regulate the biological activities of immune cells and thus mediating immune suppression, especially on macrophages and T cells. Mitochondria and autophagy-related pathways are also associated with MSC-exos immunosuppressive effects.

Human umbilical cords and exfoliated deciduous teeth are the main sources of MSCs with no donor injury or ethical issues. The goal of this study was to investigate the differences in the biological characteristics of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). UCMSCs and SHEDs were identified by flow cytometry. The proliferation, differentiation, migration, chemotaxis, paracrine, immunomodulatory, neurite growth-promoting capabilities, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity were comparatively studied between these two MSCs in vitro. The results showed that both SHEDs and UCMSCs expressed cell surface markers characteristic of MSCs. Furthermore, SHEDs exhibited better capacity for proliferation, migration, promotion of neurite growth, and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, UCMSCs showed more outstanding adipogenic differentiation and chemotaxy. Additionally, there were no significant differences in osteogenic differentiation, immunomodulatory capacity, and the proportion of ALDH(Bright) compartment. Our findings indicate that although both UCMSCs and SHEDs are mesenchymal stem cells and presented some similar biological characteristics, they also have differences in many aspects, which might be helpful for developing future clinical cellular therapies.

In Vitro High-Capacity Assay to Quantify the Clonal Heterogeneity in Trilineage Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reveals a Complex Hierarchy of Lineage Commitment	STEM CELLS												In regenerative medicine, bone marrow is a promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for a broad range of cellular therapies. This research addresses a basic prerequisite to realize the therapeutic potential of MSCs by developing a novel high-capacity assay to quantify the clonal heterogeneity in potency that is inherent to MSC preparations. The assay utilizes a 96-well format to (1) classify MSCs according to colony-forming efficiency as a measure of proliferation capacity and trilineage potential to exhibit adipo-, chondro-, and osteogenesis as a measure of multipotency and (2) preserve a frozen template of MSC clones of known potency for future use. The heterogeneity in trilineage potential of normal bone marrow MSCs is more complex than previously reported: all eight possible categories of trilineage potential were detected. In this study, the average colony-forming efficiency of MSC preparations was 55-62%, and tripotent MSCs accounted for nearly 50% of the colony-forming cells. The multiple phenotypes detected in this study infer a more convoluted hierarchy of lineage commitment than described in the literature. Greater cell amplification, colony-forming efficiency, and colony diameter for tri- versus unipotent clones suggest that MSC proliferation may be a function of potency. CD146 may be a marker of multipotency, with similar to 2-fold difference in mean fluorescence intensity between tri- and unipotent clones. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of the efficacy of MSC therapies. The in vitro assay described herein will likely have numerous applications given the importance of heterogeneity to the therapeutic potential of MSCs.

STSs may originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); the latter have mainly been isolated from adult bone marrow as plastic-adherent cells with differentiation capacity into mesenchymal tissues. Recently, a panel of antibodies has been established that allows for the prospective isolation of primary MSCs with high selectivity. Similar to cancer stem cells in other malignancies, sarcoma stem cells may bear immunophenotypic similarity with the corresponding precursor, that is, MSCs. We therefore set out to establish the expression pattern of MSC markers in sarcoma cell lines and primary tumor samples by flow cytometry. In addition, fibroblasts from different sources were examined. The results document a significant amount of MSC markers shared by sarcoma cells. The expression pattern includes uniformly expressed markers, as well as MSC markers that only stained subpopulations of sarcoma cells. Expression of W5C5, W8B2 (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase [TNAP]), CD344 (frizzled-4), and CD271 marked subpopulations displaying increased proliferation potential. Moreover, CD271+ cells displayed in vitro doxorubicin resistance and an increased capacity to form spheres under serum-free conditions. Interestingly, another set of antigens, including the bona fide progenitor cell markers CD117 and CD133, were not expressed. Comparative expression patterns of novel MSC markers in sarcoma cells, as well as fibroblasts and MSCs, are presented. Our data suggest a hierarchical cytoarchitecture of the most common adult type sarcomas and introduce W5C5, TNAP, CD344, and CD271 as potential sarcoma progenitor cell markers.

S	Sousa, B; Ribeiro, AS; Paredes, J		Birbrair, A		Sousa, Barbara; Ribeiro, Ana Sofia; Paredes, Joana			Heterogeneity and Plasticity of Breast Cancer Stem Cells	STEM CELLS HETEROGENEITY IN CANCER	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											In the last 20 years, the conventional view of breast cancer as a homogeneous collection of highly proliferating malignant cells was totally replaced by a model of increased complexity, which points out that breast carcinomas are tissues composed of multiple populations of transformed cells. A large diversity of host cells and structural components of the extracellular matrix constitute the mammary tumour microenvironment, which supports its growth and progression, where individual cancer cells evolve with cumulative phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, contributing to this heterogeneity, it has been demonstrated that breast cancers can exhibit a hierarchical organization composed of tumour cells displaying divergent lineage biomarkers and where, at the apex of this hierarchy, some neoplastic cells are able to self-renew and to aberrantly differentiate. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), as they were entitled, not only drive tumourigenesis, but also mediate metastasis and contribute to therapy resistance. Recently, adding more complexity to the system, it has been demonstrated that BCSCs maintain high levels of plasticity, being able to change between mesenchymal--like and epithelial-like states in a process regulated by the tumour microenvironment. These stem cell state transitions play a fundamental role in the process of tumour metastasis, as well as in the resistance to putative therapeutic strategies to target these cells. In this chapter, it will be mainly discussed the emerging knowledge regarding the contribution of BCSCs to tumour heterogeneity, their plasticity, and the role that this plasticity can play in the establishment of distant metastasis. A major focus will also be given to potential clinical implications of these discoveries in breast cancer recurrence and to possible BCSC targeted therapeutics by the use of specific biomarkers.

Mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as MSC) possess the property of heterogeneities and fibrolastosis, and are self-renewal and can be differentiated. Over the years, many initial and most flourished studies were performed on MSc which were separated from bone marrow; but in the recent years the use of adipose tissues have become common due to few special characteristics such as easy access, great texture and high reproduction power. The mesodermal cells have certain surface markers namely CD73, CD44, and CD90 but lack hypotonic surface markers such as CD11c, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD80 and CD86. In addition, mesodermal cells have the power to differentiate into a variety of tissues; either into other mesodermal cell types or into non-mesodermal tissues. These cells can also be used in tissue engineering and cell therapy to repair or replace damaged tissues with healthy tissues, as well as in the manufacture of vital drugs. Thus, this study aims to express few specific characteristics of MSCsisolated from adipose tissues.																	0976-3104						2016	7	8					112	118									WOS:000400111500019

However, largely incongruent data were obtained from different MSC-based clinical trials, which may be partially due to functional heterogeneity among MSC. Here, we attempt to derive homogeneous mesenchymal stem cells with neuromesodermal origin from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) and evaluate their functional properties. Methods: Growth factors and/or small molecules were used for the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into neuromesodermal progenitors (NMP), which were then cultured in animal component-free and serum-free induction medium for the derivation and long-term expansion of MSC. The resulted NMP-MSC were detailed characterized by analyzing their surface marker expression, proliferation, migration, multipotency, immunomodulatory activity and global gene expression profile. Moreover, the in vivo therapeutic potential of NMP-MSC was detected in a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Results: We demonstrate that NMP-MSC express posterior HOX genes and exhibit characteristics similar to those of bone marrow MSC (BMSC), and NMP-MSC derived from different hPSC lines show high level of similarity in global gene expression profiles. More importantly, NMP-MSC display much stronger immunomodulatory activity than BMSC in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and diminished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflamed tissue of CHS models. Conclusion: Our results identify NMP as a new source of MSC and suggest that functional and homogeneous NMP-MSC could serve as a candidate for MSC-based therapies.					huang, lihua/0000-0002-1023-5108												1838-7640						2019	9	6					1683	1697		10.7150/thno.30487							WOS:000460134200011	31037131

Although regarded as tissue-specific stem cells, human MSCs (hMSCs) have a low proliferative ability with a finite life span, which is a hurdle to further analysis of their biology. Here we attempted to establish immortalized hMSCs by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The gain in telomerase activity obtained on expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was found not to be enough to make the cell line immortal. A combination of hTERT with human papillomavirus E6 and E7 successfully immortalized hMSCs without affecting the potential for adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. From the parental immortalized hMSC, 100 single-cell derived clones were established, of which the differentiation properties varied considerably, including tri-, bi-, and uni-directional clones, suggesting that hMSCs are constituted by a group of cells with different differentiation potential. These cell lines, being the first established immortalized clonal cell lines of hMSCs, could provide insights into the mechanisms regulating the early steps of differentiation from undifferentiated MSCs into a specific lineage.

However, the origin of CSCs is still controversial. F6, a tumor cell line transformed from human fetal mesenchymal stem cells, was established in our previous study. Whether CSCs exist in this mutated cell line remains unclear. In the present study, we isolated CSCs from F6 cells based on CD133 expression using flow cytometry and investigated the biological characteristics of CD133+ F6 cells (F6-CD133+). We observed that the F6-CD133+ cells grew faster and had a higher capacity of colony formation than the F6-CD133- cells and parental F6 cells in vitro. In addition, F6-CD133+ cells had a higher tumorigenic ability than F6-CD133- cells in vivo since 1,000 F6-CD133+ cells were able to form tumors in nude mice. Cell viability assay revealed that F6-CD133+ cells were more sensitive to cisplatin while less to 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, gene expression profile analysis showed that there were 673 differentially expressed genes between F6-CD133+ and F6-CD133- cells, many of which were involved in key cell signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings confirm that F6 cells contain a population of CSCs that contribute to its heterogeneity and tumorigenic potential, indicating that transformed stem cells could be the source of CSCs, and targeting this population may lead to more effective tumor treatments.

Many studies demonstrated that BMSCs cultured in vitro were highly heterogeneous and composed of diverse cell subpopulations, which may be the basis of their multiple biological characteristics. However, the exact cell sub populations that make up BMSCs are still unknown. Methods and Results: In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to divide 6,514 BMSCs into three clusters. The number and corresponding proportion of cells in clusters 1 to 3 were 3,766 (57.81%), 1,720 (26.40%), and 1,028 (15.78%). The gene expression profile and function of the cells in the same cluster were similar. The vast majority of cells expressed the markers defining BMSCs by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis. Each cluster had at least 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We conducted Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on the top 20 DEGs of each cluster and found that the three clusters had different functions, which were related to self-renewal, multilineage differentiation and cytokine secretion, respectively. In addition, the function of the top 20 DEGs of each cluster was checked by the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene database to further verify our hypothesis. Conclusions: This study indicated that scRNA-Seq can be used to divide BMSCs into different subpopulations, demonstrating the heterogeneity of BMSCs.																	2005-3606	2005-5447															10.15283/ijsc21042		OCT 2021					WOS:000712912600001	34711696

However, a critical limitation of G-banding is that it only reflects the status of metaphase cells, which can represent as few as 0.01% of tested cells. During routine cytogenetic testing in MSCs, we often detect chromosomal aberrations in minor cell populations. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether such a minority of cells can expand over time or if they ultimately disappear during MSC passaging. We passaged MSCs serially while monitoring quantitative changes for each aberrant clone among heterogeneous MSCs. To investigate the cytogenetic status of interphase cells, which represent the main population, we also performed interphase FISH analysis, in combination with G-banding and telomere length determination. In human adipose tissue-derived MSCs, 4 types of chromosomal aberrations were found during culturing, and in umbilical cord MSCs, 2 types of chromosomal aberrations were observed. Sequential dynamic changes among heterogeneous aberrant clones during passaging were similar to the dynamic changes observed in cancer stem cells during disease progression. Throughout all passages, the quantitative G-banding results were inconsistent with those of the interphase FISH analysis. Interphase FISH revealed hidden aberrations in stem cell populations with normal karyotypes by G-banding analysis. We found that telomere length gradually decreased during passaging until the point at which cytogenetic aberrations appeared. The present study demonstrates that rare aberrant clones at earlier passages can become predominant clones during later passages. Considering the risk of tumorigenesis due to aberrant MSCs, we believe that our results will help to establish proper safety guidelines for MSC use. In particular, we believe it is critical to test for chromosomal aberrations using both G-banding and FISH to ensure the safety of human stem cells that are manufactured in vitro for clinical applications.

A mesenchymal glioma stem cell profile is related to clinical outcome	ONCOGENESIS												Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between the expression of stem cell-associated genes and relapses in glioblastoma (GBM), suggesting a key role for tumor stem cells in this process. Although there is increasing interest in this field, glioma stem cells (GSCs) are still poorly characterized, their 'stemness' state and factors maintaining these properties remain largely unknown. We performed an expression profiling analysis of pluripotency in gliomaspheres derived from 11 patients. Comparative analysis between GSCs and H1 and H9 human embryonic stem cells as well as H9-derived neural stem cells indicates major variations in gene expression of pluripotency factors Nanog and OCT4, but a stable pattern for SOX2 suggesting its important function in maintaining pluripotency in GSCs. Our results also showed that all GSC lines have the capacity to commit to neural differentiation and express mesenchymal or endothelial differentiation markers. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two groups of GSCs reflecting their heterogeneity and identified COL1A1 and IFITM1 as the most discriminating genes. Similar patterns have been observed in tumors from which gliomaspheres have been established. To determine whether this heterogeneity could be clinically relevant, the expression of both genes was further analyzed in an independent cohort of 30 patients with GBM and revealed strong correlation with overall survival. In vitro silencing of COL1A1 and IFTM1 confirmed the effect of these mesenchymal-associated genes on cell invasion and gliomasphere initiation. Our results indicate that COL1A1 and IFITM1 genes could be considered for use in stratifying patients with GBM into subgroups for risk of recurrence at diagnosis, as well as for prognostic and therapeutic evolution.

It is generally believed that the ovary harbors a fixed number of follicles at birth that differentiate during fetal development from the primordial germ cells. The numbers of follicles decrease by age, leading to menopause. However, in 2004, it was suggested that ovary may harbor stem cells that are possibly involved in the formation of new follicles throughout reproductive life. Research over little more than a decade shows that ovarian stem cells include a quiescent population of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) and slightly bigger, actively dividing ovarian stem cells (OSCs). This heterogeneity among ovarian stem cells is similar to the presence of VSELs along with spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in the testis or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the hematopoietic system. VSELs express embryonic markers, including nuclear OCT-4, and are lodged in the ovary surface epithelium (OSE). Ovarian VSELs undergo asymmetric cell division to self-renew and give rise to OSCs that in turn undergo symmetric cell divisions and clonal expansion (germ cell nest) followed by meiosis to form an oocyte that gets assembled as a primordial follicle. Both VSELs and OSCs also express receptors for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSHR) and are directly activated by FSH to undergo neooogenesis and primordial follicle assembly. Whether stimulation of ovaries by FSH in Infertility Clinics activates the stem cells leading to the formation of multiple follicles needs further investigation. Epithelial cells lining the surface of ovary provide a niche to the stem cells under normal circumstances and undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form granulosa cells for primordial follicle assembly. Compromised function of the epithelial cells with age possibly leads to inability of stem cells to form follicles, leading to menopause. More than 90% of ovarian cancers arise in the OSE, possibly due to excessive self-renewal of VSELs. Altered biology of the OSE cells results in the formation of myofibroblasts by EMT and may provide a cancerous niche that supports excessive expansion of the stem cells lodged in the OSE, leading to ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells express markers like OCT-4 and FSHR, which are also expressed by the VSELs lodged in the OSE, whereas the epithelial cells are distinctly negative for the same. Lot more research is required in the field to gain further understanding of ovarian stem cell biology.

Phenotype, aspects of biology, and clinical perspectives	MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK												square Background: Since their initial description by Friedenstem et al. 30 years ago, mesenchymal stem cells have been characterized as a cell population of the bone marrow, which is easily accessible and readily manageable for in vitro manipulation. square Results: Cell biology studies have delineated the phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells, optimized the conditions for in vitro expansion, and documented their differentiation capacity along mesodermal lineages. First clinical applications as an adjunct to stem cell transplantation regimens have shown some potential in osteogenic regeneration as well as immunosuppressive effects after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Animal studies have further shown, that mesenchymal stem cells may serve as vehicles for the transfer of genetic material. Preclinical studies remain, however, to answer numerous questions with regard to populational heterogeneity and the physiological roles of this cell compartment. square Conclusion: Further preclinical studies as well as clinical cell therapy studies are essential to fully exploit the potential of mesenchymal stem cells in regenerative medicine, cellular immunotherapy, and gene therapy.																	0723-5003					MAY 15	2006	101	5					408	413		10.1007/s00063-006-1052-6							WOS:000238060700014	16685488

The two major histopathological urothelial carcinoma types - the non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma - markedly differ in terms of their respective typical mutational profiles and also by their probable cells of origin, that is, a urothelial basal cell for muscle-invasive carcinomas and a urothelial intermediate cell for at least a large part of non-muscle-invasive carcinomas. Both non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive urothelial carcinomas can be further classified into discrete intrinsic subtypes based on their typical transcriptomic profiles. Urothelial carcinogenesis shows a number of parallels to a urothelial regenerative response. Both of these processes seem to be dominated by specific stem cell populations. In the last years, the nature and location of urothelial stem cell(s) have been subject to many controversies, which now seem to be settled down, favoring the existence of a largely single urothelial stem cell type located among basal cells. Basal cell markers have also been amply used to identify urothelial carcinoma stem cells, especially in muscle-invasive disease, but they proved useful even in some non-muscle-invasive tumors. Analyses on molecular nature of urothelial carcinoma stem cells performed till now point to their great heterogeneity, both during the tumor development and upon intertumoral comparison, sexual dimorphism providing a special example of the latter. Moreover, urothelial cancer stem cells are endowed with intrinsic plasticity, whereby they can modulate their stemness in relation to other tumor-related traits, especially motility and invasiveness. Such transitional modulations suggest underlying epigenetic mechanisms and, even within this context, inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity becomes apparent. Multiple molecular aspects of urothelial cancer stem cell biology markedly influence therapeutic response, implying their knowledge as a prerequisite to improved therapies of this disease. At the same time, the notion of urothelial cancer stem cell heterogeneity implies that this therapeutic benefit would be most probably and most efficiently achieved within the context of individualized antitumor therapy.

However, the regenerative potency of ADSCs may vary because of heterogeneity. Long-term trypsin treatment (LTT) is known to significantly concentrate multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells from human MSCs. In this study, we aimed to generate cells with high stem cell potency from canine ADSCs using LTT. After 16 h of treatment with trypsin, surviving ADSCs (LTT-tolerant cells) had significantly enhanced expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1, a mouse embryonic stem cell marker, and fucosyltransferase 9, one of several fucosyltransferases for SSEA-1 biosynthesis. However, LTT-tolerant cells did not enhance the expression of SSEA-3, a known human Muse cell marker. LTT-tolerant cells, however, showed significantly higher self-renewal capacity in the colony-forming unit fibroblast assay than ADSCs. In addition, the LTT-tolerant cells formed cell clusters similar to embryoid bodies and expressed undifferentiated markers. Moreover, these cells differentiated into cells of all three germ layers and showed significantly higher levels of alpha 2-6 sialic acid (Sia)-specific lectins, known as differentiation potential markers of human MSCs, than ADSCs. LTT-tolerant cells had a normal karyotype and had low telomerase activity, showing little carcinogenetic potency. LTT-tolerant cells also showed significantly increased activity of transmigration in the presence of chemoattractants and had increased expression of migration-related genes compared with ADSCs. In addition, LTT-tolerant cells had stronger suppressive activity against mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation than ADSCs. Overall, these results indicated that the LTT-tolerant cells in canine ADSCs have similar properties as human Muse cells (although one of the undifferentiated markers is different) and are expected to be a promising tool for regenerative therapy in dogs.

The use of UMSCs for clinical applications requires high quantity and good quality of cells usually by in vitro expansion. However, the heterogeneity and the characteristics of cultured UMSCs and the cognate human umbilical cord tissue at single-cell resolution remain poorly defined. In this study, we created a single-cell transcriptome profile of human umbilical cord tissue and the cognate culture-expanded UMSCs. Based on the inferred characteristics of cell clusters and trajectory analysis, we identified three subgroups in culture-expanded UMSCs and putative novel transcription factors (TFs) in regulating UMSC state transition. Further, putative ligand-receptor interaction analysis demonstrated that cellular interactions most frequently occurred in epithelial-like cells with other cell groups in umbilical cord tissue. Moreover, we dissected the transcriptomic differences of in vitro and in vivo subgroups and inferred the telomere-related molecules and pathways that might be activated in UMSCs for cell expansion in vitro. Our study provides a comprehensive and integrative study of the transcriptomics of human umbilical cord tissue and their cognate-cultured counterparts, which paves the way for a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and offers fundamental biological insight of UMSCs-based cell therapy.																	1742-464X	1742-4658				SEP	2021	288	18					5311	5330		10.1111/febs.15834		MAY 2021					WOS:000648992500001	33763993

In addition to providing microenvironmental support for hematopoietic processes, BM-MSCs can differentiate into various mesodermal lineages including osteoblast/osteocyte, chondrocyte, and adipocyte that are crucial for bone metabolism. While BM-MSCs have high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, the cell subtypes that contribute to this heterogeneity in vivo in humans have not been characterized. To investigate the transcriptional diversity of BM-MSCs, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on freshly isolated CD271(+) BM-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from two human subjects. We successfully identified LEPR(hi)CD45(low) BM-MSCs within the CD271(+) BM-MNC population, and further codified the BM-MSCs into distinct subpopulations corresponding to the osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation trajectories, as well as terminal-stage quiescent cells. Biological functional annotations of the transcriptomes suggest that osteoblast precursors induce angiogenesis coupled with osteogenesis, and chondrocyte precursors have the potential to differentiate into myocytes. We also discovered transcripts for several clusters of differentiation (CD) markers that were either highly expressed (e.g., CD167b, CD91, CD130 and CD118) or absent (e.g., CD74, CD217, CD148 and CD68) in BM-MSCs, representing potential novel markers for human BM-MSC purification. This study is the first systematic in vivo dissection of human BM-MSCs cell subtypes at the single-cell resolution, revealing an insight into the extent of their cellular heterogeneity and roles in maintaining bone homeostasis.				wang, zun/ABE-8516-2021													1449-2288						2021	17	15					4192	4206		10.7150/ijbs.61950							WOS:000711785200009	34803492

Following a total culture time of 14 days, adherent cells activated the Cd105 gene while suspension cells activated the Sca-1 gene. Both progenitor markers, Cbfa-1 and Ostf-1, were inactivated in both suspension and adherent cells after 14-day culture compared to cells cultured 3 days in designated differentiation medium. In conclusion, molecular analyses showed that primary mononucleated cells are heterogeneous, consisting of hematopoietic stem cells (suspension) and mesenchymal stem cells (adherent) while both cells contained no progenitor cells.

Autologous transplantations have the "elephant in the room" problem of wide donor variability, reflected by variability in MSC quality and characteristics, leading to uncertain outcomes in the use of these cells. We propose life imaging as a tool to characterize populations of human MSCs. Bone marrow MSCs from various donors and in vitro passages were evaluated for their in vitro motility, and the distances were correlated to the adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation potentials and the levels of senescence and cell size. Using life-image measuring of track lengths of 70 cells per population for a period of 24 hours, we observed that slow-moving cells had the higher proportion of senescent cells compared with fast ones. Larger cells moved less than smaller ones, and spindleshaped cells had an average speed. Both fast cells and slow cells were characterized by a low differentiation potential, and average-moving cells were more effective in undergoing all three lineage differentiations. Furthermore, heterogeneity in single cell motility within a population correlated with the average-moving cells, and fast-and slow-moving cells tended toward homogeneity (i.e., a monotonous moving Pattern). In conclusion, in vitro cell motility might be a useful tool to quickly characterize and distinguish the MSC population's differentiation potential before additional use.

S	Gonzalez, EAP		Birbrair, A		Prieto Gonzalez, Elio A.			bm Heterogeneity in Adipose Stem Cells	STEM CELLS HETEROGENEITY - NOVEL CONCEPTS	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are the basis of procedures intended for tissue regeneration. These cells are heterogeneous, owing to various factors, including the donor age, sex, body mass index, and clinical condition; the isolation procedure (liposuction or fat excision); the place from where the cells were sampled (body site and depth of each adipose depot); culture surface; type of medium (whether supplemented with fetal bovine serum or xeno-free), that affect the principal phenotypic features of ASCs. The features related to ASCs heterogeneity are relevant for the success of therapeutic procedures; these features include proliferation capacity, differentiation potential, immunophenotype, and the secretome. These are important characteristics for the success of regenerative tissue engineering, not only because of their effects upon the reconstruction and healing exerted by ASCs themselves, but also because of the paracrine signaling of ASCs and its impact on recipient tissues. Knowledge of sources of heterogeneity will be helpful in the standardization of ASCs-based procedures. New avenues of research could include evaluation of the effects of the use of more homo1geneous ASCs for specific purposes, the study of ASCs-recipient interactions in heterologous cell transplantation, and the characterization of epigenetic changes in ASCs, as well as investigations of the effect of the metabolome upon ASCs behavior in culture.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-11096-3; 978-3-030-11095-6				2019	1123						119	150		10.1007/978-3-030-11096-3_8	10.1007/978-3-030-11096-3						WOS:000471743600009

Despite the wide usage of stem cells like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), there is a lack of robust methods to rapidly discern the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of stem cells. The organization of actin cytoskeleton has been previously used to discern divergent stem cell differentiation pathways. In this paper, we highlight the versatility of a cell profiling method for actin turnover dynamics. Actin filaments in live stem cells are labeled using SiR-actin, a cell permeable fluorogenic probe, to determine the endogenous actin turnover. Live MSC imaging after days of induction successfully demonstrated lineage specific change in actin turnover. Next, we highlighted the differences in the cellular heterogeneity of actin dynamics during adipogenic or osteogenic MSC differentiation. Next, we applied the method to differentiating iPSCs in culture, and detected a progressive slowdown in actin turnover during differentiation upon stimulation with neural or cardiac media. Finally, as a proof of concept, the actin dynamic profiling was used to isolate MSCs via flow cytometry prior to sorting into three distinct sub-populations with low, intermediate or high actin dynamics. A greater fraction of MSCs with more rapid actin dynamics demonstrated increased inclination for adipogenesis, whereas, slower actin dynamics correlated with increased osteogenesis. Together, these results show that actin turnover can serve as a versatile biomarker to not only track cellular phenotypic heterogeneity but also harvest live cells with potential for differential phenotypic fates.																	1046-2023	1095-9130				JUN	2021	190						44	54		10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.05.020							WOS:000652644800006	32473293

This appears to be stimulated by the communication between cancer and stromal cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are part of the glioblastoma microenvironment, and their 'cross-talk' with glioblastoma cells is still poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of bone marrow-derived MSCs on two different established glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U373. We focused on mutual effects of direct MSC/glioblastoma contact on cellular invasion in three-dimensional invasion assays in vitro and in a zebrafish embryo model in vivo. This is the first demonstration of glioblastoma cell-type-specific responses to MSCs in direct glioblastoma co-cultures, where MSCs inhibited the invasion of U87 cells and enhanced the invasion of U373. Inversely, direct cross-talk between MSCs and both of glioblastoma cell lines enhanced MSC motility. MSC-enhanced invasion of U373 cells was assisted by overexpression of proteases cathepsin B, calpain1, uPA/uPAR, MMP-2, -9 and -14, and increased activities of some of these proteases, as determined by the effects of their selective inhibitors on invasion. In contrast, these proteases had no effect on U87 cell invasion under MSC co-culturing. Finally, we identified differentially expressed genes, in U87 and U373 cells that could explain different response of these cell lines to MSCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MSC/glioblastoma cross-talk is different in the two glioblastoma cell phenotypes, which contributes to tumor heterogeneity.

Epithelial and Mesenchymal Subpopulations Within Normal Basal Breast Cell Lines Exhibit Distinct Stem Cell/Progenitor Properties	STEM CELLS												It has been proposed that epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells generates stem cell features, and that the presence of EMT characteristics in claudin-low breast tumors reveals their origin in basal stem cells. It remains to be determined, however, whether EMT is an inherent property of normal basal stem cells, and if the presence of a mesenchymal-like phenotype is required for the maintenance of all their stem cell properties. We used nontumorigenic basal cell lines as models of normal stem cells/progenitors and demonstrate that these cell lines contain an epithelial subpopulation (EpCAM+, epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive [EpCAMpos]/CD49fhigh) that spontaneously generates mesenchymal-like cells (Fibros, EpCAMneg/CD49fmed/low) through EMT. Importantly, stem cell/progenitor properties such as regenerative potential, high aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity, and formation of three-dimensional acini-like structures predominantly reside within EpCAM+ cells, while Fibros exhibit invasive behavior and mammosphere-forming ability. A gene expression profiling meta-analysis established that EpCAM+ cells show a luminal progenitor-like expression pattern, while Fibros most closely resemble stromal fibroblasts but not stem cells. Moreover, Fibros exhibit partial myoepithelial traits and strong similarities with claudin-low breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Slug and Zeb1 EMT-inducers control the progenitor and mesenchymal-like phenotype in EpCAM+ cells and Fibros, respectively, by inhibiting luminal differentiation. In conclusion, nontumorigenic basal cell lines have intrinsic capacity for EMT, but a mesenchymal-like phenotype does not correlate with the acquisition of global stem cell/progenitor features. Based on our findings, we propose that EMT in normal basal cells and claudin-low breast cancers reflects aberrant/incomplete myoepithelial differentiation. STEM CELLS 2012; 30:292303.

Based on their surface markers, these have been assigned to two main categories: CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(+)/CD146(-) cells (adventitial stromal/stem cells [ASCs]) and CD31(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(-)/CD146(+) cells (pericytes [PCs]). These populations display heterogeneity of unknown significance. We hypothesized that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, a functional marker of primitivity, could help to better define ASC and PC subclasses. To this end, the stromal vascular fraction from a human lipoaspirate was simultaneously stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD31, CD45, CD34, and CD146 antigens and the ALDH substrate Aldefluor, then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual ASCs (n=67) and PCs (n=73) selected from the extremities of the ALDH-staining spectrum were transcriptionally profiled by Fluidigm single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a predefined set (n=429) of marker genes. To these single-cell data, we applied differential expression and principal component and clustering analysis, as well as an original gene coexpression network reconstruction algorithm. Despite the stochasticity at the single-cell level, covariation of gene expression analysis yielded multiple network connectivity parameters suggesting that these perivascular progenitor cell subclasses possess the following order of maturity: (a) ALDH(br)ASC (most primitive); (b) ALDH(dim)ASC; (c) ALDH(br)PC; (d) ALDH(dim)PC (least primitive). This order was independently supported by specific combinations of class-specific expressed genes and further confirmed by the analysis of associated signaling pathways. In conclusion, single-cell transcriptional analysis of four populations isolated from fat by surface markers and enzyme activity suggests a developmental hierarchy among perivascular mesenchymal stem cells supported by markers and coexpression networks.

Skeletal Muscle Progenitor Cell Heterogeneity	STEM CELLS HETEROGENEITY IN DIFFERENT ORGANS	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Tissue-specific stem cells contribute to adult tissue maintenance, repair, and regeneration. In skeletal muscle, many different mononuclear cell types are capable of giving rise to differentiated muscle. Of these tissue stem-like cells, satellite cells (SCs) are the most studied muscle stem cell population and are widely considered the main cellular source driving muscle repair and regeneration in adult tissue. Within the satellite cell pool, many distinct subpopulations exist, each exhibiting differential abilities to exit quiescence, expand, differentiate, and self-renew. In this chapter, we discuss the different stem cell types that can give rise to skeletal muscle tissue and then focus on satellite cell heterogeneity during the process of myogenesis/muscle regeneration. Finally, we highlight emerging opportunities to better characterize muscle stem cell heterogeneity, which will ultimately deepen our appreciation of stem cells in muscle development, repair/regeneration, aging, and disease.																	0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-030-24108-7; 978-3-030-24107-0				2019	1169						179	193		10.1007/978-3-030-24108-7_9	10.1007/978-3-030-24108-7						WOS:000514284100010	31487024

Understanding the heterogeneity of ASCs may lead to the development of improved protocols of cell isolation and optimized cell therapy clinical protocols. Using a combination of enzymatic and explant culture protocols, we obtained pADSC population, which is composed by two distinct morphologies: fibroblast-like cells (FLCs) and endothelial-like cells (ELCs). Both cell sub-types efficiently formed colonies, expressed CD90(+)/CD105(+)/CD44(+), and differentially expressed such markers such as Nestin, Vimentin, Fibronectin, Cytokeratin, Connexin 43, CD31, CD34 and CD146 as well as the pluripotent stem cell markers Oct-4, Nanog and Sox2. Mixed populations of pADSCs did not lose their multipotentiality and the cells were able to undergo osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the mixed population spontaneously formed capillary tube structures. Our findings suggest that different subpopulations can be isolated from adipose tissue and that the ADSCs need to be better evaluated using a wide panel of different markers related to cell differentiation, which is important for stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine, particularly for advanced stem cells therapies - products that are currently under investigation or even use.

Release criteria for therapeutic MSPCs cover identity, purity and safety but appropriate potency assessment is often missing. Reports on functional heterogeneity of MSPCs created additional uncertainty regarding donor and organ/source selection. We established a robust immunomodulation potency assay based on pooling responder leukocytes to minimize individual immune response variability. Comparing various MSPCs revealed significant potency inconsistency and generally diminished allo-immunosuppression compared to dose-dependent inhibition of mitogenesis. Gamma-irradiation to block unintended MSPC proliferation did not prohibit chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in vivo, indicating the need for alternative safety strategies.

Decoy TRAIL receptor CD264: a cell surface marker of cellular aging for human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a mixture of progenitors that are heterogeneous in their regenerative potential. Development of MSC therapies with consistent efficacy is hindered by the absence of an immunophenotype of MSC heterogeneity. This study evaluates decoy TRAIL receptor CD264 as potentially the first surface marker to detect cellular aging in heterogeneous MSC cultures. Methods: CD264 surface expression, regenerative potential, and metrics of cellular aging were assessed in vitro for marrow MSCs from 12 donors ages 20-60 years old. Male and female donors were age matched. Expression of CD264 was compared with that of p16, p21, and p53 during serial passage of MSCs. Results: When CD264(+) cell content was 20% to 35%, MSC cultures from young (ages 20-40 years) and older (ages 45-60 years) donors proliferated rapidly and differentiated extensively. Older donor MSCs containing < 35% CD264(+) cells had a small size and negligible senescence despite the donor's advanced chronological age. Above the 35% threshold, CD264 expression inversely correlated with proliferation and differentiation potential. When CD264(+) cell content was 75%, MSCs were enlarged and mostly senescent with severely compromised regenerative potential. There was no correlation of the older donors' chronological age to either CD264(+) cell content or the regenerative potential of the donor MSCs. CD264 was upregulated after p53 and had a similar expression profile to that of p21 during serial passage of MSCs. No sex-linked differences were detected in this study. Conclusions: These results suggest that CD264 is a surface marker of cellular age for MSCs, not the chronological age of the MSC donor. CD264 is first upregulated in MSCs at an intermediate stage of cellular aging and remains upregulated as aging progresses towards senescence. The strong inverse correlation of CD264+ cell content to the regenerative potential of MSCs has possible application to assess the therapeutic potential of patient MSCs, standardize the composition and efficacy of MSC therapies, and facilitate aging research on MSCs.

The cells, which were isolated from ovarian cortex tissue and named putative ovarian mesenchymal stem cells (PO-MSCs), were compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and to adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The results of a gene expression analysis using the Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell RTA(2) Profiler (TM) PCR Array revealed that PO-MSCs were different than fibroblasts. They expressed most of the analyzed genes as BM-MSCs, although some genes were differentially expressed. However, the heterogeneity of PO-MSCs samples was revealed. The PO-MSCs expressed the characteristic genes related to MSCs, such as CD105, CD44, CD90, M-CAM, CD73 and VCAM1. In addition, the expression of markers CD44, CD90, M-CAM and STRO-1 was confirmed in PO-MSCs using immunocytochemistry. The PO-MSCs showed multipotent character, since they were able to differentiate into the cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, neural and pancreatic lineage. Healthy adult human ovaries can harbour an interesting population of cells showing typical MSCs characteristics under in vitro conditions and for this reason we named these cells putative MSCs. These cells express genes encoding main MSCs markers and have an interesting differential potential. Based on these results, we propose PO-MSCs as a novel type of MSCs which share some similarities with BM-MSCs. Nevertheless they show distinct and specific characteristics and are not fibroblasts.

Here we report MSCs can malignantly transform in vivo. The novel neoplasm was found on the tail of female rat after injection with male rat bone marrow-derived MSCs (rBM-MSCs) and the new tumor cell line, K3, was isolated from the neoplasm. The K3 cells expressed surface antigens and pluripotent genes similar to those of rBM-MSCs and presented tumor cell features. Moreover, the K3 cells contained side population cells (SP) like cancer stem cells (CSCs), which might contribute to K3 heterogeneity and tumorigenic capacity. To investigate the metastatic potential of K3 cells, we established the nude mouse models of liver and lung metastases and isolated the corresponding metastatic cell lines K3-F4 and K3-B6. Both K3-F4 and K3-B6 cell lines with higher metastatic potential acquired more mesenchymal and stemness-related features. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a potential mechanism of K3-F4 and K3-B6 formation.

Consistent with the heterogeneity of MSCs, various surface markers have been used. However, it is still unclear which markers of MSCs are best for cell amplification in vitro and later bone regeneration in vivo. Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) is an important indicator of the stemness of human MSCs (hMSCs) and as early vascularization is also critical for bone regeneration, we used KLF2 as a novel in vitro marker for MSCs and investigated the angiogenesis and osteogenesis between KLF2(+) MSCs and endothelial cells (ECs). We found a synergistic interaction between hMSCs and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in that KLF2(+) stemness-maintained hMSCs initially promoted the angiogenesis of HUVECs, which in turn more efficiently stimulated the osteogenesis of hMSCs. In fact, KLF2(+) hMSCs secreted angiogenic factors initially, with some of the cells then differentiating into pericytes through the PDGF-BB/PDGFR-beta signaling pathway, which improved blood vessel formation. The matured HUVECs in turn synergistically enhanced the osteogenesis of KLF2(+) hMSCs through upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor. A three-dimensional coculture model using cell-laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel further confirmed these results. This study provides insight into the stemness-directed synergistic interaction between hMSCs and HUVECs, and our results will have a profound impact on further strategies involving the application of KLF2(+) hMSC/HUVEC-laden GelMA hydrogel in vascular network bioengineering and bone regeneration.

While the capacity of ASCs to express endothelial markers has been repeatedly demonstrated, none constitute conclusive evidence of an endothelial phenotype as all reported markers have been detected in other, non-endothelial cell types. In this study, quantitative phenotypic comparisons to representative EC controls were used to determine the extent of endothelial differentiation being achieved with ASCs. ASCs were harvested from human subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue, and their endothelial differentiation was induced using well-established biochemical stimuli. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry were used to quantify their expression of endothelial genes and corresponding proteins, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively assess their uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL). Human umbilical vein, coronary artery, and dermal microvascular ECs were used as positive controls to reflect the phenotypic heterogeneity between ECs derived from different vascular beds. Biochemically conditioned ASCs were found to upregulate their expression of endothelial genes and proteins, as well as AcLDL uptake, but their abundance remained orders of magnitude lower than that observed in the EC controls despite their global proteomic heterogeneity. The findings of this investigation demonstrate the strikingly limited extent of endothelial differentiation being achieved with ASCs using well-established biochemical stimuli, and underscore the importance of quantitative phenotypic comparisons to representative primary cell controls in studies of differentiation.

Because of the invasive method, limited resources, and aging problems of adult tissue-derived MSCs, more perinatal tissue-derived MSCs have been isolated and studied as promising substitutable MSCs for cell transplantation. However, fewer studies have comparatively studied the angiogenic efficacy of MSCs derived from different tissues sources. Here, we evaluated whether the in-situ environment would affect the angiogenic potential of MSCs. Methods: We harvested MSCs from adult bone marrow (BMSCs), adipose tissue (AMSCs), perinatal umbilical cord (UMSCs), and placental chorionic villi (PMSCs), and studied their "MSC identity" by flow cytometry and in-vitro trilineage differentiation assay. Then we comparatively studied their endothelial differentiation capabilities and paracrine actions side by side in vitro. Results: Our data showed that UMSCs and PMSCs fitted well with the minimum standard of MSCs as well as BMSCs and AMSCs. Interestingly, we found that MSCs regardless of their tissue origins could develop similar endothelial-relevant functions in vitro, including producing eNOS and uptaking ac-LDL during endothelial differentiation in spite of their feeble expression of endothelial-related genes and proteins. Additionally, we surprisingly found that BMSCs and PMSCs could directly form tubular structures in vitro on Matrigel and their conditioned medium showed significant proangiogenic bioactivities on endothelial cells in vitro compared with those of AMSCs and UMSCs. Besides, several angiogenic genes were upregulated in BMSCs and PMSCs in comparison with AMSCs and UMSCs. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay further confirmed that BMSCs secreted much more VEGF, and PMSCs secreted much more HGF and PGE2. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the heterogeneous proangiogenic properties of MSCs derived from different tissue origins, and the in vivo isolated environment might contribute to these differences. Our study suggested that MSCs derived from bone marrow and placental chorionic villi might be preferred in clinical application for therapeutic angiogenesis.

Comprehensive understanding of the tumorigenesis process requires elucidating the coordinated gene expression between cancer and tumor stromal cells for each tumor. We show that human gastric cancer cells (GSC1) subvert gene expression and cytokine production by mesenchymal stem cells (GSC-MSC), thus promoting tumor progression. Using mixed composition of human tumor xenografts, organotypic culture, and in vitro assays, we demonstrate GSC1-mediated specific reprogramming of "naive" MSC into specialized tumor associated MSC equipped with a tumor-promoting phenotype. Although paracrine effect of GSC-MSC or primed-MSC is sufficient to enable 2D growth of GSC1, cell-cell interaction with GSC-MSC is necessary for 3D growth and in vivo tumor formation. At both the transcriptional and at the protein level, RNA-Seq and proteome analyses, respectively, revealed increased R-spondin expression in primed-MSC, and paracrine and juxtacrine mediated elevation of Lgr5 expression in GSC1, suggesting GSC-MSC-mediated support of cancer stemness in GSC1. CSC properties are sustained in vivo through the interplay between GSC1 and GSC-MSC, activating the R-spondin/Lgr5 axis and WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. beta-Catenin+ cell clusters show beta-catenin nuclear localization, indicating the activation of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway in these cells. The beta-catenin+ cluster of cells overlap the Lgr5+ cells, however, not all Lgr5+ cells express beta-catenin. A predominant means to sustain the CSC contribution to tumor progression appears to be subversion of MSC in the TME by cancer cells.

The objective is to frame a reproducible causation between printing environment and printed cell morphology, viability and phenotype stability. Content includes: (1) a topical review classifies the overlap between physical stress vectors during printing and mesenchymal stem cell sensitivities. (2) Original flow analysis frames the feasible range of stress duration and intensity during manufacturing. (3) Preliminary empirical results define cell properties as a function of minimum, mean and maximum stress conditions. The review and analytical characterization serve as an essential precursor to interpret surprising empirical results. Results identify key cell properties are stress-dependent and controllable based on printing process parameter selection. Printing's minimum stress condition preserves cell viability. The maximum stress increases heterogeneity of cell response, induces inelastic ultra-structural distortion of the cell membrane and chromatin, and increases necrotic subpopulations post-printing. The review, analysis and preliminary results support the feasibility of modulating cell properties during fabrication by prescriptively tuning the stress environment. The process control over cell morphology, health and the rate of differentiation is both a direct result of strain during printing and an in-direct result of increased distress signaling from necrotic sub-populations.

Mesenchymal origin of multipotent human testis-derived stem cells in human testicular cell cultures	MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION												In contrast to mouse germ cell-derived pluripotent stem cells, the pluripotent state of human testis-derived embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like that spontaneously arise in primary testicular cell cultures remains controversial. Recent studies have shown that these cells closely resemble multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), raising the question of their origin and designating these cell populations as multipotent human testis-derived stem cells (mhtSCs) rather than truly ESC-like cells. Here, we evaluate the origin of mhtSCs in vitro by culturing selected testicular cell types. We demonstrate that mhtSCs can be obtained equally efficiently in cultures of pure testicular somatic cells devoid of germ cells. Conversely, cultures with a purified population of germ cells/spermatogonia do not produce any mhtSCs. Based on common molecular characteristics of the somatic starting population and mhtSCs, we conclude that mhtSCs colonies originate from somatic mesenchymal progenitors present in primary testicular cell cultures and do not arise from germ cells undergoing incomplete reprogramming in vitro.

Since the frequency of this subpopulation of stem cells in bone marrow is low, mesenchymal stem cells are expanded ex vivo and manipulated prior to experimental or clinical use. Different methods for isolation and expansion are available, but the particular effect on the stem cell character is unclear. While the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells by density centrifugation followed by selection of the plastic adherent fraction is frequently used, the composition of expansion media differs. Thus, in the present study we cultured mesenchymal stein cells isolated from five healthy young volunteers in three widely used expansion media and performed a detailed analysis of the effect on morphology, proliferation, clonogenicity, passaging, differentiation and senescence. By this way we clearly show that the type of expansion medium used determines the stem cell character and time of senescence which is critical for future gene therapeutic and regenerative approaches using mesenchymal stem cells.

The microRNA-200 family including miR-200c/141 cluster was reported to affect cancer cell invasion and metastasis by regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the effect of miR-200 family on BCSC heterogeneity is uncertain. Thus, we investigated whether the miR-200c/141 cluster had different effects on breast tumor growth and metastasis by switching the two states of BCSC. Methods: The spontaneous mammary tumor mouse model with miR-200c/141 conditional knockout was utilized for analyzing the role of miR-200c/141 cluster in vivo. The effect of miR-200c/141 cluster on BCSCs was performed by CD24/CD29 staining and ALDEFLUOR assay. miR-200c/141 target expression and EMT-related marker expression were verified in tumor sections, primary cells and breast cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR or western blotting. Statistical analysis was determined using two-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. All values were presented as the mean +/- s.e.m. Results: The deletion of miR-200c/141 cluster regulated BCSC heterogeneity and promoted the EMT-like BCSC generation, which resulted in increased tumor metastasis and inhibited tumor growth by directly upregulating the target gene homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) and sequential beta-catenin activation. Conclusions: Our results indicated that miR-200c/141 played biphasic roles in breast tumor progression via affecting the BCSC heterogeneity, suggesting targeting BCSC heterogeneity to simultaneously restrict breast cancer initiation and metastasis could be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.				liu, suling/AAF-5249-2019; Liu, Suling/N-2796-2013	liu, suling/0000-0002-0475-0242; Liu, Suling/0000-0002-0475-0242												1838-7640						2018	8	21					5801	5813		10.7150/thno.29380							WOS:000451946500001	30613263

Secreted heat shock protein 90 promotes prostate cancer stem cell heterogeneity	ONCOTARGET												Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a highly conserved molecular chaperone, is frequently upregulated in tumors, and remains an attractive anti-cancer target. Hsp90 is also found extracellularly, particularly in tumor models. Although extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) action is not well defined, eHsp90 targeting attenuates tumor invasion and metastasis, supporting its unique role in tumor progression. We herein investigated the potential role of eHsp90 as a modulator of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in prostate cancer (PCa). We report a novel function for eHsp90 as a facilitator of PCa stemness, determined by its ability to upregulate stem-like markers, promote self-renewal, and enhance prostasphere growth. Moreover, eHsp90 increased the side population typically correlated with the drug-resistant phenotype. Intriguingly, tumor cells with elevated surface eHsp90 exhibited a marked increase in stem-like markers coincident with increased expression of the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) effector Snail, indicating that surface eHsp90 may enrich for a unique CSC population. Our analysis of distinct effectors modulating the eHsp90-dependent CSC phenotyperevealed that eHsp90 is a likely facilitator of stem cell heterogeneity. Taken together, our findings provide unique functional insights into eHsp90 as a modulator of PCa plasticity, and provide a framework towards understanding its role as a driver of tumor progression.																		1949-2553				MAR 21	2017	8	12					19323	19341		10.18632/oncotarget.14252							WOS:000396879200057	28038472

In this study such a heterogeneity was reflected by the CD200 protein. We thus characterized CD200(pos) cells sorted from whole BM MSC cultures and we investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating CD200 expression. After sorting, measurement of lineage markers showed that the osteoblastic genes RUNX2 and DLX5 were up-regulated in CD200(pos) cells compared to CD200(neg) fraction. At the functional level, CD200(pos) cells were prone to mineralize the extra-cellular matrix in vitro after sole addition of phosphates. In addition, osteogenic cues generated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) or BMP7 strongly induced CD200 expression. These data suggest that CD200 expression is related to commitment/differentiation towards the osteoblastic lineage. Immunohistochemistry of trephine bone marrow biopsies further corroborates the osteoblastic fate of CD200(pos) cells. However, when dexamethasone was used to direct osteogenic differentiation in vitro, CD200 was consistently down-regulated. As dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory properties, we assessed the effects of different immunological stimuli on CD200 expression. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor- increased CD200 membrane expression but down-regulated osteoblastic gene expression suggesting an additional regulatory pathway of CD200 expression. Surprisingly, whatever the context, i.e. pro-inflammatory or pro-osteogenic, CD200 expression was down-regulated when nuclear-factor (NF)-B was inhibited by chemical or adenoviral agents. In conclusion, CD200 expression by cultured BM MSCs can be induced by both osteogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines through the same pathway: NF-kappa B.

Integrin-beta 4 identifies cancer stem cell-enriched populations of partially mesenchymal carcinoma cells	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Neoplastic cells within individual carcinomas often exhibit considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in their epithelial versus mesenchymal-like cell states. Because carcinoma cells with mesenchymal features are often more resistant to therapy and may serve as a source of relapse, we sought to determine whether such cells could be further stratified into functionally distinct subtypes. Indeed, we find that a basal epithelial marker, integrin-beta 4 (ITGB4), can be used to enable stratification of mesenchymal like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells that differ from one another in their relative tumorigenic abilities. Notably, we demonstrate that ITGB4(+) cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched mesenchymal cells reside in an intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal phenotypic state. Among patients with TNBC who received chemotherapy, elevated ITGB4 expression was associated with a worse 5-year probability of relapse-free survival. Mechanistically, we find that the ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1) transcription factor activity in highly mesenchymal SUM159 TNBC cells can repress expression of the epithelial transcription factor TAp63 alpha (tumor protein 63 isoform 1), a protein that promotes ITGB4 expression. In addition, we demonstrate that ZEB1 and ITGB4 are important in modulating the histopathological phenotypes of tumors derived from mesenchymal TNBC cells. Hence, mesenchymal carcinoma cell populations are internally heterogeneous, and ITGB4 is a mechanistically driven prognostic biomarker that can be used to identify the more aggressive subtypes of mesenchymal carcinoma cells in TNBC. The ability to rapidly isolate and mechanistically interrogate the CSC-enriched, partially mesenchymal carcinoma cells should further enable identification of novel therapeutic opportunities to improve the prognosis for high-risk patients with TNBC.

However, these markers are also expressed by other cell types and primary cell pools reveal considerable heterogeneity. Therefore, the simultaneous detection of several markers on a single cell appears to be an attractive approach to identify hMSC. Here we demonstrate the specific distinction of human MSC from human osteoblasts via seven-colour fluorescence on the single cell level with simultaneous marker detection of CD44, CD105/endoglin, CD106/VCAM-1, collagen-IV, fibronectin, actin and DAPI nuclear staining. We performed spectral image acquisition using a Sagnac-type interferometer. Subsequent linear unmixing allowed for decomposition of each pixel in its spectral components. Our approach reveals a typical expression profile of the adherent singular cells, allowing the specific distinction between hMSC and osteoblasts on the single cell level.

Effective application of MSCs in disease treatment relies on the production of relatively homogeneous cell population. However, the cellular heterogeneity and the differentiation trajectories of in vitro expanded MSCs remain largely unclear. We profiled the transcriptomes of 361 single MSCs derived from two umbilical cords (UC-MSCs). These UC-MSCs were harvested at different passages and stimulated with or without inflammatory cytokines. Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that UC-MSCs surprisingly possess only limited heterogeneity, regardless of donors, and passages. We also found that upon pretreatment with inflammatory cytokines (IFN gamma and TNF alpha), a classical strategy that can improve the efficiency of MSC-based therapy, MSCs exhibited uniformed changes in gene expression. Cell cycle-based principal component analysis showed that the limited heterogeneity identified in these UC-MSCs was strongly associated with their entrance into the G2/M phase. This was further proven . by the observation that one featured gene, CD168, was expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. When CD168(high) UC-MSCs were sorted and cultured in vitro, they again showed similar CD168 expression patterns. Our results demonstrated that in vitro expanded UC-MSCs are a well-organized population with limited heterogeneity dominated by cell cycle status. Thus, our studies provided information for standardization of MSCs for disease treatment.

These cells were around 5 mu m in diameter and their relative gravity was between 1.031 and 1.043 g/ml. In sharp contrast to the parent MSCs, they expressed highly CD271 and poorly the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor. Quantitative PCR with the identification of the products by DNA sequencing proved that these cells expressed Nanog at a higher level than cells from the other subpopulation (approximately 30-fold), which was further confirmed by western blotting. Furthermore, they did not grow at clonal density and depletion of these cells from the population had little effect on the colony formation of the parent MSCs. The results here indicate that a subpopulation of cells with special biological features exist in human cord MSCs in culture.

Methods The characteristics of HUCMSCs derived from multiple donors were comprehensively analyzed including expressions of surface markers, viability, growth curve, karyotype analysis, tumorigenicity, differentiation potentials, and immune regulation capability. Then, the HUCMSCs with distinct immunomodulatory effects were applied to treat mouse liver fibrosis and their therapeutic effects were observed. Results The HUCMSCs derived from multiple donors kept a high consistency in surface marker expressions, viability, growth curve, and tumorigenicity in nude mice but had robust heterogeneities in differentiation potentials and immune regulations. In addition, three HUCMSC lines applied to mice liver fibrosis model had different therapeutic outcomes, in line with individual immune regulation capability. Conclusion The HUCMSCs derived from different donors have individual heterogeneity, which potentially lead to distinct therapeutic outcomes in mouse liver fibrosis, indicating we could make use of the donor-variation of MSCs to screen out guaranteed general indicators of MSCs for specific diseases in further stromal cell therapy.

Recently, aggregation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in nonadherent culture has been shown to reverse expansion-induced heterogeneity and loss of stemness and reprogram the hMSC to reacquire their primitive phenotype, a phenomenon that can significantly enhance therapeutic applications of hMSC. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanistic basis underlying the connection between multicellular aggregation and stemness enhancement in hMSC by testing the hypothesis that cellular events induced during three-dimensional aggregation on nonadherent substratum induces changes in mitochondrial metabolism that promote the expression of stem cell genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Our results show that aggregation changes mitochondrial morphology and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in a metabolic reconfiguration characterized by increased glycolytic and anaplerotic flux, and activation of autophagy. We further demonstrate that interrupting mitochondrial respiration in two-dimensional planar culture with small molecule inhibitors partially recapitulates the aggregation-mediated enhancement in stem cell properties, whereas enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the aggregated state reduces the aggregation-induced upregulation of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Our findings demonstrate that aggregation-induced metabolic reconfiguration plays a central role in reacquisition of primitive hMSC phenotypic properties.

The proliferation and osteogenic differentiation potential of MSCs vary according to factors such as tissue source and cell population heterogeneity. Dental tissue has received attention as an easily accessible source of high-quality stem cells. In this study, we compared the in vitro characteristics of dental pulp stem cells from deciduous teeth (SHED), human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC5), and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Materials and methods: SEHD and hDPSCs were isolated from dental pulp and analyzed in comparison with human bone marrow (hBM)MSC5. Proliferative capacity of cultured cells was analyzed using a bromodeoxyuridine immunoassay and cell counting. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were monitored to assess osteogenic differentiation. Mineralization was evaluated by alizarin red staining. Levels of bone marker mRNA were examined by real-time PCR analysis. Results: SHED were highly proliferative compared with hDPSCs and hBMSC5. SHED, hDPSC5, and hBMSCs exhibited dark alizarin red staining on day 21 after induction of osteogenic differentiation, and staining of hBMSCs was significantly higher than that of SHED and hDPSCs by spectrophotometry. ALP staining was stronger in hBMSC5 compared with SHED and hDPSCs, and ALP activity was significantly higher in hBMSC5 compared with SHED or hDPSC5. SHED showed significantly higher expression of the Runx2 and ALP genes compared with hBMSCs, based on real-time PCR analysis. In bFGF, SHED showed significantly higher expression of the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) gene compared with hDPSC5 and hBMSCs. Conclusion: SHED exhibited higher proliferative activity and levels of bFGF and BMP-2 gene expression compared with BMMSC5 and DPSCs. The ease of harvesting cells and ability to avoid invasive surgical procedures suggest that SHED may be a useful cell source for application in bone regeneration treatments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Injectable supramolecular polymer-nanoparticle hydrogels enhance human mesenchymal stem cell delivery	BIOENGINEERING & TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												Stem cell therapies have emerged as promising treatments for injuries and diseases in regenerative medicine. Yet, delivering stem cells therapeutically can be complicated by invasive administration techniques, heterogeneity in the injection media, and/or poor cell retention at the injection site. Despite these issues, traditional administration protocols using bolus injections in a saline solution or surgical implants of cell-laden hydrogels have highlighted the promise of cell administration as a treatment strategy. To address these limitations, we have designed an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel platform exploiting multivalent, noncovalent interactions between modified biopolymers and biodegradable nanoparticles for encapsulation and delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSC-based therapies have shown promise due to their broad differentiation capacities and production of therapeutic paracrine signaling molecules. In this work, the fundamental hydrogel mechanical properties that enhance hMSC delivery processes are elucidated using basic in vitro models. Further, in vivo studies in immunocompetent mice reveal that PNP hydrogels enhance hMSC retention at the injection site and retain administered hMSCs locally for upwards of 2 weeks. Through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrate a novel scalable, synthetic, and biodegradable hydrogel system that overcomes current limitations and enables effective cell delivery.

Multivariate biophysical markers predictive of mesenchymal stromal cell multipotency	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The capacity to produce therapeutically relevant quantities of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) via in vitro culture is a common prerequisite for stem cell-based therapies. Although culture expanded MSCs are widely studied and considered for therapeutic applications, it has remained challenging to identify a unique set of characteristics that enables robust identification and isolation of the multipotent stem cells. New means to describe and separate this rare cell type and its downstream progenitor cells within heterogeneous cell populations will contribute significantly to basic biological understanding and can potentially improve efficacy of stem and progenitor cell-based therapies. Here, we use multivariate biophysical analysis of culture-expanded, bone marrow-derived MSCs, correlating these quantitative measures with biomolecular markers and in vitro and in vivo functionality. We find that, although no single biophysical property robustly predicts stem cell multipotency, there exists a unique and minimal set of three biophysical markers that together are predictive of multipotent subpopulations, in vitro and in vivo. Subpopulations of culture-expanded stromal cells from both adult and fetal bone marrow that exhibit sufficiently small cell diameter, low cell stiffness, and high nuclear membrane fluctuations are highly clonogenic and also exhibit gene, protein, and functional signatures of multipotency. Further, we show that high-throughput inertial microfluidics enables efficient sorting of committed osteoprogenitor cells, as distinct from these mesenchymal stem cells, in adult bone marrow. Together, these results demonstrate novel methods and markers of stemness that facilitate physical isolation, study, and therapeutic use of culture-expanded, stromal cell subpopulations.

Strategies for suppressing EMT remain the subject of ongoing research. In the present study, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate side population (SP) cells from human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and xenograft tissues. After identifying their molecular and functional stem-like characteristics, stem-like SP cells from a cell line and from xenograft tissue were transfected with hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). The potential of the prostate stem-like SP cells to undergo EMT was compared with that in their bulk counterparts after HIF-1 introduction. Stem-like SP cells acquired more complete EMT molecular features and exhibited stronger aggressive capability than the homologous bulk population cells both in vitro (proliferation and invasion) and in vivo (tumorigenesis and metastasis formation). We, therefore, concluded that EMT is closely associated with tumor heterogeneity, and that PCa cells susceptible to EMT are enriched in stem-like SP cells. These findings disclose a new approach, targeting the cellular basis of the EMT process that may help to identify effective and accurate methods for suppressing tumor growth and preventing distant dissemination.																	1021-335X	1791-2431				FEB	2014	31	2					874	884		10.3892/or.2013.2905							WOS:000332694400047	24316717

Although adipose- and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have already been used in a considerable number of clinical trials for osteoarthritis treatment, systematic analyses from single- to bulk-cell resolution as well as clinical outcomes of these 2 MSCs are still insufficient. Purpose: To explore the characteristics and differences of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) at single- and bulk-cell levels, to study the clinical outcomes of these 2 cells on the treatment of osteoarthritis, and to provide potential guidance on the more precise clinical application of these MSCs. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study and meta-analysis. Methods: Same donor-derived ADSCs and BMSCs were isolated and cultured. Single- and bulk-cell assays were used to identify the characteristics of these 2 cells. Meta-analysis of clinical trials was done to compare the clinical therapeutic effects in osteoarthritis treatment with ADSCs and BMSCs. Results: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that the population of ADSCs showed lower transcriptomic heterogeneity when compared with BMSCs. Additionally, as compared with BMSCs, ADSCs were less dependent on mitochondrial respiration for energy production. Furthermore, ADSCs had a lower expression level of human leukocyte antigen class I antigen and higher immunosuppression capacity when compared with the BMSC population. Meta-analysis of current clinical trials of osteoarthritis treatment with MSCs consistently showed that ADSCs are more stable than BMSCs in their therapeutic effect. Conclusion: These results provide basic biological insights into human ADSCs and BMSCs at the single-cell resolution. Findings indicated that ADSCs may be a more controllable stem cell source, may be more adaptable to surviving in the hypoxic articular cavity niche, and may exhibit superiority in regulating inflammation. Based on the meta-analysis results of the different characteristics of ADSCs and BMSCs, ADSCs were implicated as being a better cell source for osteoarthritis treatment.Clinical Relevance: These results guide a more precise clinical application of adipose and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

J	Heng, BC; Saxena, P; Fussenegger, M				Heng, Boon Chin; Saxena, Pratik; Fussenegger, Martin			Heterogeneity of baseline neural marker expression by undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells may be correlated to donor age	JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Previous studies reported much heterogeneity in baseline neural marker expression by undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of animal and human origin, which could confound reproducibility of neural differentiation experiments with MSCs. Nevertheless, basic donor characteristics such as age and gender were unspecified in these previous studies; and relative levels of baseline neural marker expression amongst primary MSCs of different tissue and donor origin have not been compared by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, which is the focus of this study. The results showed that amongst a mixed group of primary adipose and bone marrow-derived MSCs (12-50 years), the observed variability in baseline neural marker expression may be correlated to donor age. Adipose-derived MSCs from the youngest donor (male, 12 years old) displayed the highest expression of all four early neural markers (Pax6, Nestin, Musashi 1 and beta III-tubulin), and three out of four mature neural markers (NCAM, NSE and NFM) analyzed by qRT-PCR. Conversely, adipose MSCs of the oldest donor (female, 50 years old) displayed the lowest expression of three out of four early neural markers (Pax6, Musashi 1 and beta III-tubulin), and three out of four mature neural markers (MAP2, NCAM and NSE) analyzed by qRT-PCR.

Here, we show that this cell heterogeneity is conserved in human epicardium, regulated by BNC1 and associated with cell fate and function. Single cell RNA sequencing of epicardium derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-epi) revealed that distinct epicardial subpopulations are defined by high levels of expression for the transcription factors BNC1 or TCF21. WT1(+) cells are included in the BNC1(+) population, which was confirmed in human foetal hearts. THY1 emerged as a membrane marker of the TCF21 population. We show that THY1 . cells can differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), whereas THY1(-) cells were predominantly restricted to SMCs. Knocking down BNC1 during the establishment of the epicardial populations resulted in a homogeneous, predominantly TCF21(high) population. Network inference methods using transcriptomic data from the different cell lineages derived from the hPSC-epi delivered a core transcriptional network organised around WT1, TCF21 and BNC1. This study unveils a list of epicardial regulators and is a step towards engineering subpopulations of epicardial cells with selective biological activities.

Tissue-based identification of stem cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer	HUMAN PATHOLOGY												Pathologists have recognized breast cancer heterogeneity for decades, but its causes were unknown. In recent years, basic science and translational studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells contribute to the heterogeneous histologic and functional characteristics of breast cancer. Even more recently, the ability of breast epithelial cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has been linked to the acquisition of stem cells properties and enhanced tumor invasion, metastasis, and resistance to available treatments. The stem cells and cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition are attractive targets for therapy and breast cancer prevention. Despite current challenges, their identification in breast tissue samples would enable pathologists to discover and validate prognostic and predictive markers as well as identify markers of increased risk for breast cancer.

Quantification of clonal heterogeneity of mesenchymal progenitor cells in dental pulp and bone marrow	CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH												This study aimed to compare the expression of "classical" stem cell markers, the proliferative capacity and differentiation ability of clonal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) populations isolated from animal matched dental pulp (DP) and bone marrow (BM) of rats. MSCs were derived from the aforementioned tissues, with immature MSCs selected for by preferential fibronectin-adherence and resultant single-cell derived clonal populations culture expanded. Colony forming efficiencies were 12 times greater for DP clones compared with BM clones. Expansion of isolated colonies, however, was 5 times more successful for BM clones. All clones exceeded 40 population doublings (PDs) and all exhibited periods of high and low proliferative rates. PDs were approximately 1.5 times higher for BM clones. All BM clones readily differentiated towards osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. Of the three DP clones analysed, all demonstrated osteogenesis, albeit with reduced efficiency compared to BM clones. One clone demonstrated adipogenesis and one clone chodrogenesis. qPCR determined quantifiable differences in Msx2, Vcam2 and Mcam with no clone showing similarity to another. The expression of a specific mesenchymal marker did not predict proliferative or differentiation potential. These results also suggest lineage restriction of the DP clones.

In this regard, it is important to identify gene expression patterns according to culture conditions, and to determine how the cells are expanded and when they should be clinically used. In the current study, stemness gene expression was investigated in adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) harvested following culture at different densities. AT-MSCs were plated at a density of 200 or 5,000 cells/cm(2). After 7 days of culture, stemness gene expression was examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The proliferation rate of AT-MSCs harvested at a low density (similar to 50% confluent) was higher than that of AT-MSCs harvested at a high density (similar to 90% confluent). Although there were differences in the expression levels of stemness gene, such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4, nanog homeobox (Nanog), SRY-box 2, Kruppel like factor 4, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), and lin-28 homolog A, in the AT-MSCs obtained from different donors, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated differential gene expression patterns according to the cell culture density. Expression levels of stemness genes, particularly Nanog and c-Myc, were upregulated in AT-MSCs harvested at a low density (similar to 50% confluent) in comparison to AT-MSCs from the same donor harvested at a high density (similar to 90% confluent). These results imply that culture conditions, such as the cell density at harvesting, modulate the stemness gene expression and proliferation of MSCs.																	2049-9434	2049-9442				MAR	2017	6	3					300	306		10.3892/br.2017.845							WOS:000398086100008	28451390

Methods: Functional changes were investigated in vitro and in vivo following spontaneous fusion and hybrid cell formation between primary human MSC and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Thus, lentiviral eGFP-labeled MSC and breast cancer cells labeled with mcherry resulted in dual-fluorescing hybrid cells after co-culture. Results: Double FACS sorting and single cell cloning revealed two different aneuploid male hybrid populations (MDA-hyb1 and MDA-hyb2) with different STR profiles, pronounced telomerase activities, and enhanced proliferative capacities as compared to the parental cells. Microarray-based mRNA profiling demonstrated marked regulation of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased expression of metastasis-associated genes including S100A4. In vivo studies following subcutaneous injection of the breast cancer and the two hybrid populations substantiated the in vitro findings by a significantly elevated tumor growth of the hybrid cells. Moreover, both hybrid populations developed various distant organ metastases in a much shorter period of time than the parental breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Together, these data demonstrate spontaneous development of new tumor cell populations exhibiting different parental properties after close interaction and subsequent fusion of MSC with breast cancer cells. This formation of tumor hybrids contributes to continuously increasing tumor heterogeneity and elevated metastatic capacities.

ON THE ORIGIN AND IMPACT OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL HETEROGENEITY: NEW INSIGHTS AND EMERGING TOOLS FOR SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display substantial cell-to-cell variation. This heterogeneity manifests among donors, among tissue sources, and within cell populations. Such pervasive variability complicates the use of MSCs in regenerative applications and may limit their therapeutic efficacy. Most conventional assays measure MSC properties in bulk and, as a consequence, mask this cell-to-cell variation. Recent studies have identified extensive variability amongst and within clonal MSC populations, in dimensions including functional differentiation capacity, molecular state (e.g. epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic status), and biophysical properties. While the origins of these variations remain to be elucidated, potential mechanisms include in vivo micro-anatomical heterogeneity, epigenetic bistability, and transcriptional fluctuations. Emerging tools for single cell analysis of MSC gene and protein expression may yield further insight into the mechanisms and implications of single cell variation amongst these cells, and ultimately improve the clinical utility of MSCs in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. This review outlines the dimensions across which MSC heterogeneity is present, defines some of the known mechanisms that govern this heterogeneity, and highlights emerging technologies that may further refine our understanding and improve our clinical application of this unique cell type.

Exploring the Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapy in Mouse Models of Vascular Cognitive Impairment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Closely linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathological spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is known to be wide and complex. Considering that multiple instead of a single targeting approach is considered a treatment option for such complicated diseases, the multifaceted aspects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them a suitable candidate to tackle the heterogeneity of VCI. MSCs were delivered via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route in mice that were subjected to VCI by carotid artery stenosis. VCI was induced in C57BL6/J mice wild type (C57VCI) mice by applying a combination of ameroid constrictors and microcoils, while ameroid constrictors alone were bilaterally applied to 5xFAD (transgenic AD mouse model) mice (5xVCI). Compared to the controls (minimal essential medium (MEM)-injected C57VCI mice), changes in spatial working memory were not noted in the MSC-injected C57VCI mice, and unexpectedly, the mortality rate was higher. In contrast, compared to the MEM-injected 5xVCI mice, mortality was not observed, and the spatial working memory was also improved in MSC-injected 5xVCI mice. Disease progression of the VCI-induced mice seems to be affected by the method of carotid artery stenosis and due to this heterogeneity, various factors must be considered to maximize the therapeutic benefits exerted by MSCs. Factors, such as the optimal MSC injection time point, cell concentration, sacrifice time point, and immunogenicity of the transplanted cells, must all be adequately addressed so that MSCs can be appropriately and effectively used as a treatment option for VCI.

Heterogeneity and hierarchy of tissue stem cells in the MFe of newborn vocal fold were investigated in vivo. Study design Histologic analysis of the human vocal folds. Methods Five normal human newborn vocal folds were investigated under transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. Results Cobblestone-like polygonal cells, vocal fold stellate cell-like cells, and fibroblast-like spindle cells were intermingled in the newborn MFe in vivo, indicating that the cells in the MFe had heterogeneity. However, cobblestone-like polygonal cells were predominant. Free ribosomes were well developed in the cytoplasm. The cells in some cases formed gap junctions with each other. The cells in some cases were attached to other cells and formed cell junctions with each other. These findings indicated cells in the newborn maculae flavae possessed features of mesenchymal cells (cells in mesenchyme). Colony-forming-unit-like cell aggregate was observed, indicating the cells in the newborn MFe had stemness. The cobblestone-like polygonal cells expressed SSEA-3 (a human pluripotent stem cell marker), indicating they were at the top of a cellular hierarchy in the stem cell system. Conclusions The cells in the MFe of the human newborn vocal fold mucosa had heterogeneity and hierarchy in the stem cell system in vivo. At birth, newborn maculae flavae are ready to start the growth of the vocal fold mucosa as a vibrating tissue.																	2378-8038					OCT	2020	5	5					903	910		10.1002/lio2.470		SEP 2020					WOS:000573411400001	33134538

We have evaluated the characteristics of mesenchymal stromal cells in a cohort of patients with MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD). MSCs were cultured from bone marrow aspirates of MDS-MLD patients and controls with healthy bone marrow. Phenotypic characterization, cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Targeted gene expression analysis was done using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). MSCs derived from MDS patients (MDS-MSCs) showed normal morphology, phenotype, karyotype and differentiation potential towards adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, these MDS-MSCs showed significantly altered cell cycle status and displayed a shift towards increased apoptosis compared to control MSCs (C-MSCs). The gene expression profile of niche responsive/regulatory cytokines showed a trend towards lower expression VEGF, SCF, and ANGPT with no changes in expression of CXCL12A and LIF compared to C-MSCs. The expression levels of Notch signaling components like Notch ligands (JAGGED-1 and DELTA-LIKE-1), receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH3) and downstream gene (HES1) showed an aberrant expression pattern in MDS-MSCs compared to C-MSCs. Similarly, Q-PCR analysis of Wnt signaling inhibitory ligands (DKK-1 and DKK-2) in MDS-MSCs showed a three-fold increase in mRNA expression of DKK1 and a two-fold increase in DKK2 compared to C-MSCs. These data suggested that MDS-MSCs have an altered proliferation characteristic as well as a dysregulated cytokine secretion and signaling profile. These changes could contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS.																	0971-4502	0974-0449				APR	2019	35	2					223	232		10.1007/s12288-018-1062-6							WOS:000474767900004	30988556

It is hypothesized that somatic stem cells (SSC) undergoing abnormal differentiation and evolution are able to form heterogeneous cell clusters, leading to onset of tumors. Methods: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated and cultured, then BMSCs were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and neuroblasts. The differentiation process of BMSCs was interrupted at certain time points, and the cells at various stages of maturation were obtained. The resulting cells were further cultured to their fourth generation, then they were subject to the soft agar colony forming assay to screen the mutated cells that form dusters after losing their contact inhibition. The mutant cells were cultured for 5 days, then inoculated on the renal fascia of mice, which were pre-treated with immunosuppress reagent cyclophosphamide (CTX). Results: Tissue biopsies confirmed a generation of heterogeneous cell clusters in the mice. These clusters morphologically resemble Hela cells, as they share similar pathophysiology, histomorphology and cell biology features with cancer tissues. These findings indicate that the evolved heterogeneous cell clusters can lead to cancer. Conclusions: This study reveals the pathogenesis of tumors in respect to stem cells. Tumor stem cells may arise from the abnormal differentiation and evolution of SSC. From then on, tumor production evolves including heterogeneity, metastasis, immune escape and infinite increment.																	2218-676X	2219-6803				DEC	2018	7	6					1643	1656		10.21037/tcr.2018.12.16							WOS:000454529800036

A Simple Modification of the Separation Method Reduces Heterogeneity of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells	CELLS TISSUES ORGANS												High hopes are put into the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in various approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. MSCs are derived from different tissues with only small differences in their phenotype or their differentiation potential, but higher differences in the cell yield. Since fat is easily accessible and contains a high amount of MSCs to be isolated, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are very promising for clinical approaches. ASCs are not a completely homogeneous cell population. Our study was initiated to explore an easy and convenient method to reduce heterogeneity. We tested different isolation methods: (1) the standard isolation method for ASCs based on plastic attachment, (2) the standard method with an initial washing step after 60 min of adherence and (3) immunomagnetic isolation by 4 typical markers (CD49a, CD90, CD105 and CD271). Cells isolated by these methods were evaluated using quantitative PCR and flow cytometry as well as by their differentiation potential. Washing led to a significantly lower expression of desmin, smA and six2, and a higher expression of the stem cell markers nestin, oct-4 and sall-1, compared to standard isolated cells, while the immunomagnetically isolated cells showed no significant changes. All cells independent of the isolation method could be induced to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Our study demonstrates that a simple washing step reduces heterogeneity of cultured ASCs according to PCR analysis, whereas the immunomagnetic isolation only showed minor advantages compared to the standard method, but the disadvantage of significantly lower cell yields in the primary isolates.

These interactions were monitored in vivo following co-injection of GFP-labeled human MSC together with mcherry-labeled MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in NODscid mice. Within 14 days of tumor development the number of initially co-injected MSC had significantly declined and spontaneous formation of breast cancer/MSC hybrid cells was observed by the appearance of double fluorescing cells. This in vivo fusion displayed a rare event and occurred in less than 0.5% of the tumor cell population. Similar findings were observed in a parallel in vitro co-culture. Characterization of the new cell fusion products obtained after two consecutive flow cytometry cell sorting and single cell cloning revealed two populations, termed MDA-hyb3 and MDA-hyb4. The breast cancer fusion cells expressed both, GFP and mcherry and displayed more characteristics of the MDA-MB-231 cells than of the parental MSC. While little if any differences were determined in the proliferative capacity, a significant delay of MDA-hyb3 cells in tumor formation was observed when compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, MDA-hyb3 cells developed an altered pattern of distant organ metastases. These findings demonstrated dynamic tumor changes by in vivo and in vitro fusion with the development of new breast cancer hybrid cells carrying altered tumorigenic properties. Consequently, cancer cell fusion contributes to progressively increasing tumor heterogeneity which complicates a therapeutic regimen.

Pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells improve cardiac function and vascularity after myocardial infarction	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to improve cardiac function after injury and are the subject of ongoing clinical trials. In this study, the authors tested the cardiac regenerative potential of an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSC (iPSC-MSC) population (Cymerus MSCs) in a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Furthermore, the authors compared this efficacy with bone marrow- derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), which are the predominant cell type in clinical trials. Methods: Four days after myocardial I/R injury, rats were randomly assigned to (i) a Cymerus MSC group (n = 15), (ii) a BM-MSC group (n = 15) or (iii) a vehicle control group (n = 14). For cell-treated animals, a total of 5 x 10(6) cells were injected at three sites within the infarcted left ventricular (LV) wall. Results: One month after cell transplantation, Cymerus MSCs improved LV function (assessed by echocardiography) compared with vehicle and BM-MSCs. Interestingly, Cymerus MSCs enhanced angiogenesis without sustained engraftment or significant impact on infarct scar size. Suggesting safety, Cymerus MSCs had no effect on inducible tachycardia or the ventricular scar heterogeneity that provides a substrate for cardiac re-entrant circuits. Conclusions: The authors here demonstrate that intra-myocardial administration of iPSC-MSCs (Cymerus MSCs) provide better therapeutic effects compared with conventional BM-MSCs in a rodent model of myocardial I/R. Because of its manufacturing scalability, iPSC-MSC therapy offers an exciting opportunity for an "off-the-shelf" stem cell therapy for cardiac repair.

However, this progenitor property is not shared by all cells within the MSC population. In addition, MSCs vary in their proliferation capacity and expression of markers. Because of heterogeneity of CD146 expression in the MSC population, we compared CD146(-/Low) and CD146(High) cells under clonal conditions and after sorting of the non-clonal cell population to determine whether this expression is associated with specific functions. CD146(-/Low) and CD146(High) bone marrow MSCs did not differ in colony-forming unit-fibroblast number, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation or in vitro haematopoietic-supportive activity. However, CD146(-/Low) clones proliferated slightly but significantly faster than did CD146(High) clones. In addition, a strong expression of CD146 molecule was associated with a commitment to a vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) lineage characterized by a strong up-regulation of calponin-1 and SM22 expression and an ability to contract collagen matrix. Thus, within a bone marrow MSC population, certain subpopulations characterized by high expression of CD146, are committed towards a VSMC lineage.

Due to the fact that the peak of incidence is in the growth spurt of adolescence, the specific anatomical location, and the heterogeneity of cells, it is believed that osteosarcomagenesis is a process associated with bone development. Different studies in murine models showed that the tumor-initiating cell in OS could be an uncommitted mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) developing in a specific bone microenvironment. However, only a few studies have reported transgene-induced human MSCs transformation and mostly obtained undifferentiated sarcomas. In our study, we demonstrate that activator protein 1 family members induce osteosarcomagenesis in immortalized hMSC. c-JUN or c-JUN/c-FOS overexpression act as tumorigenic factors generating OS with fibroblastic or pleomorphic osteoblastic phenotypes, respectively.

As a result, medical costs and associated comorbidity will exponentially increase in the coming decades. In the past decade, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel treatment for degenerative joint disease. Evidence Acquisition: PubMed (from 1990 to 2013) was searched to identify relevant studies. Reference lists of included studies were also reviewed. Study Design: Clinical review. Results: We identified 9 animal and 7 human studies investigating the use of MSCs in the treatment of osteoarthritis, with varying levels of support for this therapy. Conclusion: While MSCs have shown potential for improving function and decreasing inflammation in animal studies, translation to patients is still in question. There is a great deal of heterogeneity in treatment methods. Standardizing the manufacturing and characterization of MSCs will allow for better comparisons.

In contrast to the embryonic stem cells (ESCs), MSCs are easily subject to aging and senescence because of their finite ability of self-renewal. MSCs senescence seriously affected theirs application prospects as a promising tool for cell-based regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. In the present study, we established a reversible immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (IMSCs) line by using SSR#69 retrovirus expressing simian virus 40 large T (SV40T) antigen as an alternative to primary MSCs. Methods: The retroviral vector SSR#69 expressing simian virus 40 large T (SV40T) antigen was used to construct IMSCs. IMSCs were identified by flow cytometry to detect cell surface makers. To investigate proliferation and differentiation potential of IMSCs, cell growth curve determination and mesodermal trilineage differentiation tests were performed. Neuronal differentiation characteristics of IMSCs were detected in vitro. Before IMSCs transplantation, we excluded its tumorigenicity in nude mice firstly. The Morris water maze tests and shuttle box tests were performed five weeks after HIBD models received cells transplantation therapy. Results: In this study, reversible IMSCs were constructed successfully and had the similar morphology and cell surface makers as primary MSCs. IMSCs possessed better ability of proliferation and anti-senescence compared with primary MSCs, while maintained multilineage differentiation capacity. Neural-like cells derived from IMSCs had similar expressions of neural-specific genes, protein expression patterns and resting membrane potential (RMP) compared with their counterparts derived from primary MSCs. There was no bump formation in nude mice subcutaneously injected with IMSCs. IMSCs played same role as primary MSCs to improve learning ability and spatial memory of HIBD rats. Conclusions: IMSCs not only retain their features of primary MSCs but also possess the ability of high proliferation and anti-senescence. IMSCs can definitely be induced to differentiate into neuronal cells in vitro and take the place of primary MSCs for cell transplantation therapy without tumorigenesis in vivo. The stable cell line is particularly useful and valuable as an alternative to MSCs in neuronal differentiation and neuroregeneration associated studies.

A Clinical Indications Prediction Scale Based on TWIST1 for Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells	EBIOMEDICINE												In addition to their stem/progenitor properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) also exhibit potent effector (angiogenic, antiinflammatory, immuno-modulatory) functions that are largely paracrine in nature. It is widely believed that effector functions underlie most of the therapeutic potential of MSCs and are independent of their stem/progenitor properties. Here we demonstrate that stem/progenitor and effector functions are coordinately regulated at the cellular level by the transcription factor Twist1 and specified within populations according to a hierarchicalmodel. We further show that manipulation of Twist1 levels by genetic approaches or by exposure to widely used culture supplements including fibroblast growth factor 2 (Ffg2) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) alters MSC efficacy in cell-based and in vivo assays in a predictable manner. Thus, by mechanistically linking stem/progenitor and effector functions our studies provide a unifying framework in the form of an MSC hierarchy that models the functional complexity of populations. Using this framework, we developed a CLinical Indications Prediction (CLIP) scale that predicts how donor-to-donor heterogeneity and culture conditions impact the therapeutic efficacy of MSC populations for different disease indications.

Single-cell RNA sequencing of equine mesenchymal stromal cells from primary donor-matched tissue sources reveals functional heterogeneity in immune modulation and cell motility	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background The efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy is thought to depend on the intrinsic heterogeneity of MSC cultures isolated from different tissue sources as well as individual MSCs isolated from the same tissue source, neither of which is well understood. To study this, we used MSC cultures isolated from horses. The horse is recognized as a physiologically relevant large animal model appropriate for translational MSC studies. Moreover, due to its large size the horse allows for the simultaneous collection of adequate samples from multiple tissues of the same animal, and thus, for the unique collection of donor matched MSC cultures from different sources. The latter is much more challenging in mice and humans due to body size and ethical constraints, respectively. Methods In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on primary equine MSCs that were collected from three donor-matched tissue sources; adipose tissue (AT), bone marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PB). Based on transcriptional differences detected with scRNA-seq, we performed functional experiments to examine motility and immune regulatory function in distinct MSC populations. Results We observed both inter- and intra-source heterogeneity across the three sources of equine MSCs. Functional experiments demonstrated that transcriptional differences correspond with phenotypic variance in cellular motility and immune regulatory function. Specifically, we found that (i) differential expression of junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) between MSC cultures from the three donor-matched tissue sources translated into altered cell motility of BM-derived MSCs when RNA interference was used to knock down this gene, and (ii) differences in C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (CXCL6) expression in clonal MSC lines derived from the same tissue source correlated with the chemoattractive capacity of PB-derived MSCs. Conclusions Ultimately, these findings will enhance our understanding of MSC heterogeneity and will lead to improvements in the therapeutic potential of MSCs, accelerating the transition from bench to bedside.

We analyzed the elastic modulus-dependent dynamics of a mechanotransducer, YAP, and an osteogenic differentiation factor, RUNX2, in three different MSC lots using a styrenated gelatin gel with controllable elastic modulus. The percentage of cells with YAP in the nucleus increased linearly with increases in the elastic modulus, reaching a plateau at 10 kPa for all the lots analyzed. The increase in the percentage with the substrate elastic modulus was described by the same linear function. The percentage of cells with RUNX2 nuclear localization also increased linearly with increases in the substrate elastic modulus, plateauing at 5 kPa, although the regression lines to the linearly increasing regions varied between lots. These similarities and differences in YAP and RUNX2 dynamics among cell populations are basis to design the substrate elastic modulus to manipulate YAP and RUNX2 localizations.

Therefore, increased understanding of the mechanisms regulating GSCs aggressiveness may help to improve patients' outcomes. Here, we investigated the role of integrin a6 in controlling stemness and resistance to radiotherapy across proneural and mesenchymal molecular subtypes. We observed that integrin a6 had a clear role in stemness maintenance in proneural but not in mesenchymal GSCs. In addition, we proved a crucial role of integrin a6 in supporting mesenchymal GSCs resistance to ionizing radiation. Finally, we highlighted that integrin a6 may control different stem-associated features in GSCs, depending on the molecular subtype. The inhibition of integrin a6 limits stem-like malignant characteristics in both GSCs subtypes and thus may potentially control tumour relapse following conventional treatment. Therapeutic resistance after multimodal therapy is the most relevant cause of glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence. Extensive cellular heterogeneity, mainly driven by the presence of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs), strongly correlates with patients' prognosis and limited response to therapies. Defining the mechanisms that drive stemness and control responsiveness to therapy in a GSC-specific manner is therefore essential. Here we investigated the role of integrin a6 (ITGA6) in controlling stemness and resistance to radiotherapy in proneural and mesenchymal GSCs subtypes. Using cell sorting, gene silencing, RNA-Seq, and in vitro assays, we verified that ITGA6 expression seems crucial for proliferation and stemness of proneural GSCs, while it appears not to be relevant in mesenchymal GSCs under basal conditions. However, when challenged with a fractionated protocol of radiation therapy, comparable to that used in the clinical setting, mesenchymal GSCs were dependent on integrin a6 for survival. Specifically, GSCs with reduced levels of ITGA6 displayed a clear reduction of DNA damage response and perturbation of cell cycle pathways. These data indicate that ITGA6 inhibition is able to overcome the radioresistance of mesenchymal GSCs, while it reduces proliferation and stemness in proneural GSCs. Therefore, integrin a6 controls crucial characteristics across GBM subtypes in GBM heterogeneous biology and thus may represent a promising target to improve patient outcomes.

These difficulties are due to tumor heterogeneity, which has many origins. One may be cell fusion, a process that is relevant in both physiological (e.g., wound healing) and pathophysiological (cancer and viral infection) processes. In this study, we examined if cell fusion between mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and breast cancer (BC) cells occurs and if newly generated hybrid cells may exhibit cancer stem/initiating cell (CS/IC) characteristics. Therefore, several methods such as mammosphere assay, AldeRed assay, flow cytometry (CD24, CD44, CD104) and Western blot analysis (of epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers such as SNAIL, SLUG and Twist) were applied. In short, four different hybrid clones, verified by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, were analyzed; each expressed an individual phenotype that seemed not to be explicitly related to either a more stem cell or cancer cell phenotype. These results show that cancer cells and MSCs are able to fuse spontaneously in vitro, thereby giving rise to hybrid cells with new properties, which likely indicate that cell fusion may be a trigger for tumor heterogeneity.

Quantitatively analyzing the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells on cardiomyocytes in single-cell biochips	BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS												To understand how stem cells benefit native cardiomyocytes is crucial for cell-based therapies to rescue cardiomyocytes (CMCs) damaged during heart infarction and other cardiac diseases. However, the current conclusions on the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained by analyzing the overall amount of protein and factor secretion in a conventional co-culture system. These results neglected the heterogeneity of MSC population and failed to determine the importance of cellular contact to the protective effects. To address these issues, we have constructed two biochips by microfabrication methods and laser-guided cell micropatterning technique. Using the biochips, the protective effect of MSCs on CMCs can be quantitatively analyzed at single-cell level with defined cellular contact. The role of cellular contact on protective effect can be clarified according to our statistical results.

Here, we developed a single-cell FTIR microspectroscopy-based method for the quantitative evaluation of cellular heterogeneity by calculating the cell-to-cell similarity distance of the infrared spectral data. Based on this method, we revealed the infrared phenotypes might reflect the dynamic heterogeneity changes in the cell population during the adipogenic differentiation of the human mesenchymal stem cells. These findings provide an alternative label-free optical approach for quantifying the cellular heterogeneity, and the combination with other single-cell analysis tools will be very helpful for understanding the genotype-to-phenotype relationship in cellular populations.				liu, zhixiao/F-8809-2015	liu, zhixiao/0000-0003-0794-8462												0003-2700	1520-6882				JAN 19	2021	93	2					671	676		10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04110							WOS:000612336200003	33290049					
J	Scheel, C; Weinberg, RA				Scheel, Christina; Weinberg, Robert A.			Phenotypic plasticity and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in cancer and normal stem cells?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER												Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are similar to normal stem cells in their ability to self-renew and to generate large populations of more differentiated descendants. In contrast to the hierarchical organization that is presumed to be the prevalent mode of normal tissue homeostasis, phenotypic plasticity allows cancer cells to dynamically enter into and exit from stem-cell states. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been closely associated with the acquisition of both invasive and stem-cell properties in cancer cells. Thereby, EMT programs emerge as important regulators of phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells including their entrance into stem-cell states. Much is still to be learned about the regulation of EMTs through epigenetic mechanisms in cancer cells and the contributions that EMT programs make to normal tissue homeostasis.																	0020-7136	1097-0215				NOV 15	2011	129	10					2310	2314		10.1002/ijc.26311							WOS:000295231000002	21792896

Recent phenotypic analysis has shown heterogeneity of MSCs. Nestin progenitor cell is a subpopulation within MSCs which plays a role in pancreas regeneration during embryogenesis. This study aimed to separate nestin((+)) cells from human bone marrow MSCs, and differentiate these cells into functional insulin producing cells (IPCs) compared with nestin((-)) cells. Manual magnetic separation was performed to obtain nestin((+)) cells from MSCs. Approximately 91 +/- 3.3% of nestin nestin((+)) cells were positive for anti-nestin antibody. Pluripotent genes were overexpressed in nestin cells compared with nestin((-)) cells as revealed by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Following in vitro differentiation, flow cytometric analysis showed that 2.7 +/- 0.5% of differentiated nestin((+)) cells were positive for anti-insulin antibody in comparison with 0.08 +/- 0.02% of nestin((-)) cells. QRT-PCR showed higher expression of insulin and other endocrine genes in comparison with nestin((-)) cells. While immunofluorescence technique showed the presence of insulin and C-peptide granules in nestin((+)) cells. Therefore, our results introduced nestin((+)) cells as a pluripotent subpopulation within human MSCs which is capable to differentiate and produce functional IPCs.

Several isolation strategies have been pursued to identify these cells prospectively, leading to the isolation of various cell populations endowed with multi-lineage mesodermal potential. Historically, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were the first cell population to be isolated from the stromal fraction of most connective tissues. These cells are able to differentiate towards various mesodermal lineages and are currently the most studied adult mesodermal progenitors. Recently, the isolation of a subpopulation of microvascular pericytes (PCs) endowed with multi-lineage mesodermal potential has led to the identification of mesenchymal progenitors that reside in a defined anatomical location, namely the wall of small blood vessels. To gain insight into these two related cell populations, we performed a detailed analysis of the mesodermal potential of isogenic human MSCs and PCs isolated from white adipose tissue. Although both cell populations expressed known mesodermal markers at similar levels and displayed a comparable growth rate, PCs differentiated towards osteocytes, adipocytes and myocytes more efficiently than their MSC counterparts, as revealed by both histological and molecular assays. Our results show that microvascular PCs are more prone to mesenchymal differentiation than MSCs and therefore represent a preferable source of human adult mesenchymal progenitors when adipose tissue is used as a cell source.

Expression of mesenchymal stem cell marker CD90 on dermal sheath cells of the anagen hair follicle in canine species	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY												The dermal sheath (DS) of the hair follicle is comprised by fibroblast-like cells and extends along the follicular epithelium, from the bulb up to the infundibulum. From this structure, cells with stem characteristics were isolated: they have a mesenchymal origin and express CD90 protein, a typical marker of mesenchymal stem cells. It is not yet really clear in which region of hair follicle these cells are located but some experimental evidence suggests that dermal stem cells are localized prevalently in the lower part of the anagen hair follicle. As there are no data available regarding DS stem cells in dog species, we carried out a morphological analysis of the hair follicle DS and performed both an immunohistochemical and an immunocytochemical investigation to identify CD90(+) cells. We immunohistochemically evidenced a clear and abundant positivity to CD90 protein in the DS cells located in the lower part of anagen hair follicle. The positive cells showed a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They were flat and elongated and inserted among bundles of collagen fibres. The whole structure formed a close and continuous sleeve around the anagen hair follicle. Our immunocytochemical study allowed us to localize CD90 protein at the cytoplasmic membrane level.

Objective The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics of MSCs derived from two different human tissues: peripheral blood (PB-MSCs) and umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly (UC-MSCs). Methods The PB-MSC and UC-MSC were isolated by adherence to plastic after gradient-density separation or an explant culture method, respectively, and compared regarding their morphology, clonogenic efficiency, proliferating rates, immunophenotype and differentiation potential. Results MSCs derived from both sources exhibit similar morphology, proliferation capacity and multilineage (osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic) differentiation potential. Differences were observed in the clonogenic capacity and the immunophenotype, since UC-MSCs showed higher CFU-F (colony-forming units-fibroblastic) cloning efficiency, as well as higher embryonic markers (Nanog, Sox2, SSEA4) expression. When additional surface antigens were analyzed by flow cytometry (CD44, CD90, CD105, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD235a) or immunofluorescent labeling (vimentin, STRO-1 and a-smooth muscle actin), most appeared to have similar epitope profiles irrespective of MSC source. Conclusion The results obtained demonstrated that both MSCs represent good alternative sources of adult MSCs that could be used in cell therapy applications.

The goal of this study was to determine whether stem cells from esophageal atresia patients (EA) could be utilized for this purpose. Methods: Adipose tissue was obtained from control, esophageal atresia (EA) and long gap esophageal atresia (LGEA) patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated, expanded, characterized and seeded onto tubular scaffolds for 6 days. Scaffolds were characterized for viability, gene expression and cytokine production. Results: The average weight of tissue from the EA and LGEA patients was 145.8mg compared to 2981 mg in controls. Despite the small amount of tissue obtained from neonatal patients, cells were expanded to cover a scaffold. After incubating 6 days on the scaffold, cells were viable and proliferating with differences in gene expression between groups. VEGFA production in the supernatant was increased in EA and LGEA patients: while IL6 production was significantly increased in the control patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability to utilize small amounts of adipose tissue from esophageal atresia patients as a cell source for regenerative medicine. Future studies will focus on use of these cells for tissue regeneration in vivo. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

To establish the impact of environmental inflammatory factors on MSCs' immunofunction in the mirror of intrinsic heterogeneity of mouse MSC population, individual MSC clones were generated and characterized. Adipogenic but not osteogenic differentiation and pro-angiogenic activity of five independent MSC cell lines were similar. Regarding osteogenic differentiation, clones MSC3 and MSC6 exhibited poorer capacity than MSC2, MSC4, and MSC5. To study the immunosuppressive heterogeneity, in vitro and in vivo experiments have been carried out using T-cell proliferation assay and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, respectively. A remarkable difference was found between the clones in their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation in the following order: MSC2MSC5>MSC4>MSC3>>MSC6. Nevertheless, the differences between the immunosuppressive activities of the individual clones disappeared on pretreatment of the cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines, a procedure called licensing. Stimulation of all clones with IFN- and TNF- resulted in elevation of their inhibitory capability to a similar level. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were identified as major mediators of immunofunction of the MSC clones. The earlier findings were also supported by in vivo results. Without licensing, MSC2 inhibited DTH response, while MSC6 did not affect DTH response. In contrast, prestimulation of MSC6 with inflammatory cytokines resulted in strong suppression by this clone as well. Here, we have showed that MSC population is functionally heterogeneous in terms of immunosuppressive function; however, this variability is largely reduced under pro-inflammatory conditions.

Bone-forming perivascular cells: Cellular heterogeneity and use for tissue repair	STEM CELLS												Mesenchymal progenitor cells are broadly distributed across perivascular niches-an observation conserved between species. One common histologic zone with a high frequency of mesenchymal progenitor cells within mammalian tissues is the tunica adventitia, the outer layer of blood vessel walls populated by cells with a fibroblastic morphology. The diversity and functions of (re)generative cells present in this outermost perivascular niche are under intense investigation; we have reviewed herein our current knowledge of adventitial cell potential with a somewhat narrow focus on bone formation. Antigens of interest to functionally segregate adventicytes are discussed, including CD10, CD107a, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoforms, and CD140a among others. Purified adventicytes (such as CD10(+), CD107a(low), and CD140a(+) cells) have stronger osteogenic potential and promote bone formation in vivo. Recent bone tissue engineering applications of adventitial cells are also presented. A better understanding of perivascular progenitor cell subsets may represent a beneficial advance for future efforts in tissue repair and bioengineering.

Although the development of single cell transcriptomic technologies holds promise to deconvolute this complexity, a number of these techniques have limitations including drop-out and uneven coverage, which challenge the further delineation of tumor heterogeneity. We adopted deep and full-length single-cell RNA sequencing on Fluidigm's Polaris platform to reveal the cellular, transcriptomic, and isoform heterogeneity of SUM149, a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. We first validate the quality of the TNBC sequencing data with the sequencing data from erythroleukemia K562 cell line as control. We next scrutinized well-defined marker genes for cancer stem-like cell to identify different cell populations. We then profile the isoform expression data to investigate the heterogeneity of alternative splicing patterns. Though classified as triple-negative breast cancer, the SUM149 stem cells show heterogeneous expression of marker receptors (ER, PR, and HER2) across the cells. We identified three cell populations that express patterns of stemness: epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cancer stem cells (CSCs), mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) CSCs and Dual-EMT-MET CSCs. These cells also manifested a high level of heterogeneity in alternative splicing patterns. For example, CSCs have shown different expression patterns of the CD44v6 exon, as well as different levels of truncated EGFR transcripts, which may suggest different potentials for proliferation and invasion among cancer stem cells. Our study identified features of the landscape of previously underestimated cellular, transcriptomic, and isoform heterogeneity of cancer stem cells in triple-negative breast cancers.

Subpopulations of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Exhibit Differential Effects in Delaying Retinal Degeneration	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE												Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have a therapeutic role in retinal degeneration (RD). However, heterogeneity of BMSCs may be associated with differential therapeutic effects in RD. In order to confirm this hypothesis, two subsets of rat BMSCs, termed rBMSC1 and rBMSC2, were obtained, characterized and functionally evaluated in the treatment of RD of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats. Both subpopulations expressed mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) markers CD29 and CD90, but were negative for hemacyte antigen CD11b and CD45 expression. In comparison with rBMSC2, rBMSC1 showed higher rate of proliferation, stronger colony formation, and increased adipogenic potential, whereas rBMSC2 exhibited higher osteogenic potential. Microarray analysis showed differential gene expression patterns between rBMSC1 and rBMSC2, including functions related to proliferation, differentiation, immunoregulation, stem cell maintenance and division, survival and antiapoptosis. After subretinal transplantation in RCS rats, rBMSC1 showed stronger rescue effect than rBMSC2, including increased b-wave amplitude, restored retinal nuclear layer thickness, and decreased number of apoptotic photoreceptors, whereas the rescue function of rBMSC2 was essentially not better than the control. Histological analysis also demonstrated that rBMSC1 possessed a higher survival rate than rBMSC2 in subretinal space. In addition, treatment of basic fibroblast growth factor, an accompanying event in subretinal injection, triggered more robust increase in secretion of growth factors by rBMSC1 as compared to rBMSC2. Taken together, these results have suggested that the different therapeutic functions of BMSC subpopulations are attributed to their distinct survival capabilities and paracrine functions. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the different functions of BMSC subpopulation may lead to a new strategy for the treatment of RD.																	1566-5240	1875-5666					2016	16	6					567	581		10.2174/1566524016666160607090953							WOS:000382640200006	27280495

Here, we probe the collective importance of heterogeneity in cell size and deformability in breast cancer invasion. A computational model of invasion of a heterogeneous cell aggregate predicts that combined heterogeneity in cell size and deformability enhances invasiveness of the whole population, with maximum invasiveness at intermediate cell-cell adhesion. We then show that small cells of varying deformability, a subpopulation predicted to be enriched at the invasive front, exhibit considerable overlap with the biophysical properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In MDA-MB-231 cells, these include CD44(hi) CD24(-) mesenchymal CSCs, which are small and soft, and CD44(hi) CD24(+) hybrid CSCs, which exhibit a wide range of size and deformability. We validate our predictions by tracking the pattern of cell invasion from spheroids implanted in three-dimensional collagen gels, wherein we show temporal enrichment of CD44(hi) cells at the invasive front. Collectively, our results illustrate the advantages imparted by biophysical heterogeneity in enhancing cancer invasiveness.

Artee; Weiss, Samuel			SLUG Directs the Precursor State of Human Brain Tumor Stem Cells	CANCERS												In glioblastoma (GBM), brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) encompass heterogenous populations of multipotent, self-renewing, and tumorigenic cells, which have been proposed to be at the root of therapeutic resistance and recurrence. While the functional significance of BTSC heterogeneity remains to be fully determined, we previously distinguished relatively quiescent stem-like precursor state from the more aggressive progenitor-like precursor state. In the present study, we hypothesized that progenitor-like BTSCs arise from stem-like precursors through a mesenchymal transition and drive post-treatment recurrence. We first demonstrate that progenitor-like BTSCs display a more mesenchymal transcriptomic profile. Moreover, we show that both mesenchymal GBMs and progenitor-like BTSCs are characterized by over-activated STAT3/EMT pathways and that SLUG is the primary epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor directly regulated by STAT3 in BTSCs. SLUG overexpression in BTSCs enhances invasiveness, promotes inflammation, and shortens survival. Importantly, SLUG overexpression in a quiescent stem-like BTSC line enhances tumorigenesis. Finally, we report that recurrence is associated with SLUG-induced transcriptional changes in both BTSCs and GBM patient samples. Collectively, our findings show that a STAT3-driven precursor state transition, mediated by SLUG, may prime BTSCs to initiate more aggressive mesenchymal recurrence. Targeting the STAT3/SLUG pathway may maintain BTSCs in a quiescent stem-like precursor state, delaying recurrence and improving survival in GBM.																		2072-6694				NOV	2019	11	11							1635	10.3390/cancers11111635							WOS:000502290100017	31652994

Several preclinical studies have shown that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have therapeutic potential for patients with ARDS because of their immunomodulatory properties. The clinical use of hMSCs has some limitations, such as the extensive manipulation required to isolate the cells from bone marrow aspirates and the heterogeneity in their anti-inflammatory effect in animal models and clinical trials. The objective of this study was to improve the protective anti-inflammatory capacity of hMSCs by evaluating the consequences of preactivating hMSCs before use in a murine model of ARDS. We injected endotoxemic mice with minimally manipulated hMSCs isolated from the bone marrow of vertebral bodies with or without prior activation with serum from ARDS patients. Minimally manipulated hMSCs were more efficient at reducing lung inflammation compared with isolated and in vitro expanded hMSCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates. Where the most important effect was observed was with the activated hMSCs, independent of their source, which resulted in increased expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RN), which was associated with enhancement of their protective capacity by reduction of the lung injury score, development of pulmonary edema, and accumulation of bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cells and cytokines compared with nonactivated cells. This study demonstrates that a low manipulation during hMSC isolation and expansion increases, together with preactivation prior to the therapeutic use of hMSCs, would ensure an appropriate immunomodulatory phenotype of the hMSCs, reducing the heterogeneity in their anti-inflammatory effect.

As umbilical cord blood originates from fetus, abundant MSCs are expected to circulate in fetus. However, the properties of circulating MSCs in fetus have not been fully examined. In the present study, we aimed to analyze circulating MSCs, marked by the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha), during fetal development. Using PDGFR alpha GFP knock-in mice, we quantified the number of circulating PDGFR alpha positive MSCs during development. We further performed whole transcriptome analysis of circulating MSCs at single cell levels. We found that abundant PDGFR alpha positive cells circulate in embryo and diminish immediately after birth. In addition, single cell RNA-sequencing revealed transcriptional heterogeneity of MSCs in fetal circulation. These data lay a foundation to analyze the function of circulating MSCs during development.

However, the potency of MSCs is not equivalent to the pluripotency of ESCs or iPSCs. We used CHIR 99021 to improve current protocols and methods of differentiation for the enhanced transdifferentiation potency of MSCs. Main Methods: We used Flurescence activated cell sorter (FACS) for MSC immunophenotyping and biochemical assay for demonstrating the trilineage potential of MSCs. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and Western blotting assay for analyzing the expression of lineage-specific markers. Key Findings: CHIR 99021 treatment of MSCs resulted in enhanced transdifferentiation into neurological, hepatogenic and cardiomyocyte lineages with standardized protocols of differentiation. CHIR 99021treated MSCs showed increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin. These MSCs showed a significantly increased deposition of active histone marks (H3K4Me3, H3K36Me3), whereas no change was observed in repressive marks (H3K9Me3, H3K27Me3). Differential methylation profiling showed demethylation of the transcription factor OCT4 promoter region with subsequent analysis revealing increased gene expression and protein content. The HLA-DR antigen was absent in CHIR 99021treated MSCs and their differentiated cell types, indicating their immune-privileged status. Karyotyping analysis showed that CHIR 99021treated MSCs were genomically stable. Teratoma analysis of nude mice injected with CHIR 99021treated MSCs showed the increased presence of cell types of mesodermal origin at the site of injection. Significance: MSCs pretreated with CHIR 99021 can be potent, abundant alternative sources of stem cells with enhanced differentiation capabilities that are well suited to cell-based regenerative therapy.

Metabolomic mapping of cancer stem cells for reducing and exploiting tumor heterogeneity	ONCOTARGET												Personalized cancer medicine based on the analysis of tumors en masse is limited by tumor heterogeneity, which has become a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are emerging as key drivers of inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. CSC have unique metabolic dependencies that are required not only for specific bioenergetic/biosynthetic demands but also for sustaining their operational epigenetic traits, i.e. self-renewal, tumor-initiation, and plasticity. Given that the metabolome is the final downstream product of all the -omic layers and, therefore, most representative of the biological phenotype, we here propose that a novel approach to better understand the complexity of tumor heterogeneity is by mapping and cataloging small numbers of CSC metabolomic phenotypes. The narrower metabolomic diversity of CSC states could be employed to reduce multidimensional tumor heterogeneity into dynamic models of fewer actionable sub-phenotypes. The identification of the driver nodes that are used differentially by CSC states to metabolically regulate self-renewal and tumor initation and escape chemotherapy might open new preventive and therapeutic avenues. The mapping of CSC metabolomic states could become a pioneering strategy to reduce the dimensionality of tumor heterogeneity and improve our ability to examine changes in tumor cell populations for cancer detection, prognosis, prediction/monitoring of therapy response, and detection of therapy resistance and recurrent disease. The identification of driver metabolites and metabolic nodes accounting for a large amount of variance within the CSC metabolomic sub-phenotypes might offer new unforeseen opportunities for reducing and exploiting tumor heterogeneity via metabolic targeting of CSC.

However, the effects of long term exposure to serum culture conditions on glioma sphere cultures/glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) have not been examined. Here we show that GSCs retained both neurosphere formation and tumor initiation abilities after short or long term serum exposure. Under these conditions, GSCs expressed both neural lineage and stem cell markers, highlighting the aberrant pseudo-differentiation state. GSCs maintained under adherent serum cultured conditions continued to proliferate and initiate tumor formation with efficiencies similar to GSCs maintained under proliferating (neurosphere) conditions. Proneural (PN) GSCs under serum exposure showed an induction of mesenchymal (MES) gene expression signatures. Our data indicate that exposure to serum containing media result in aberrant differentiation (e.g. toward MES lineage) and activation of alternative oncogenic pathways in GSCs.

Spatially coordinated changes in intracellular rheology and extracellular force exertion during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation	PHYSICAL BIOLOGY												The mechanical properties within the cell are regulated by the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is linked to the extracellular environment through focal adhesion proteins that transmit force. Chemical and mechanical stimuli alter the organization of cytoskeletal actin, which results in changes in cell shape, adhesion, and differentiation. By combining particle-tracking microrheology and traction force cytometry, we can monitor the mechanical properties of the actin meshwork and determine how changes in the intracellular network contribute to force generation. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemical (differentiation factors) and mechanical (substrate rigidity) stimuli important in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation on the intracellular mechanics and traction stress generation. We found the presence of adipogenic factors resulted in stiffening of the actin meshwork regardless of substrate rigidity. In contrast, these factors increased traction stresses on hard substrates, which was associated with increased expression of contractility genes. Furthermore, MSCs cultured on hard substrates expressed both adipogenic and osteogenic markers indicative of mixed differentiation. On hard substrates, heterogeneity in the local elastic modulus-traction stress correlation was also increased in response to adipogenic factors, indicating that these mechanical properties may be reflective of differences in the level of MSC differentiation. These results suggest intracellular rheology and traction stress generation are spatially regulated and contribute insight into how single cell mechanical forces contribute to MSC differentiation.

Intact, less than 30% of MSCs contribute to cardiomyocytes differentiation, and the isolation procedure and biological characteristics of this population of cells remain unknown. Here we isolate and investigate the biological characteristics of this subpopulation of MSCs. Twenty four MSC clones were randomly selected using single-cell monoclonal technology. After induced with 5-azacytidine, eight clones displayed cardiomyocyte-like morphologies, and highly (over 90%) expressed cardiac-specific markers cTnT and alpha-actin, and displayed transient outward K+ current (I-to), inwardly rectifying K+ current (I-K1) and delayed rectifier K+ current (I-KDR), which were typical of cardiomocytes. Other clones merely showed I-to current, and the current densities were different from those of cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the other clones, before induced with 5-azacytidine, the eight clones expressed early cardiac markers GATA4 and NKX2.5, but not cTnT, alpha-actin, CD44 and CD90, and had no potentials for adiopogenesis, osteogenesis or chondrogenesis after induction. Our data suggest that the subgroup of MSCs that contributes to cardiomyocytes differentiation is cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, we show the preliminary purification of this population of cells with a high potential for cardiomyocytes differentiation using single-cell monoclonal technology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Optimal conditions for culture of MSC have been under investigation. The oxygen tension used for cultivation has been studied and appears to play an important role in biological behavior of mesenchymal cells. The aim is characterize MSC in hypoxia and normoxia conditions comparing their morphological and functional characteristics. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells obtained from 15 healthy donors and cultured. MSC obtained from each donor were separated into two cultivation conditions normoxia (21% O-2) and hypoxia (three donors at 1%, three donors at 2%, five donors at 3%, and four donors at 4% O-2) up to second passage. MSC were evaluated for proliferation, differentiation, immunophenotyping, size and cell complexity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial activity, and autophagy. Culture conditions applied did not seem to affect immunophenotypic features and cellular plasticity. However, cells subjected to hypoxia showed smaller size and greater cellular complexity, besides lower proliferation (P < 0.002). Furthermore, cells cultured in low O2 tension had lower mitochondrial activity (P < 0.03) and a reduced tendency to autophagy, although oxidative stress did not vary among groups (P < 0.39). Oxygen tension seems to be a key regulator of cellular adaptation in vitro, and metabolic effects underlying this variable remain undescribed. Heterogeneity or even lack of results on the impact of oxygen concentration used for expanding MSC highlights the need for further research, in order to optimize conditions of cultivation and expansion and achieve greater safety and therapeutic efficacy.

Noradrenaline Sensitivity Is Severely Impaired in Immortalized Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Line	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Primary adipose tissue-derived multipotent stem/stromal cells (adMSCs) demonstrate unusual signaling regulatory mechanisms, i.e., increased of sensitivity to catecholamines in response to noradrenaline. This phenomenon is called "heterologous sensitization", and was previously found only in embryonic cells. Since further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for such sensitization in primary adMSCs was difficult due to the high heterogeneity in adrenergic receptor expression, we employed immortalized adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell lines (hTERT-MSCs). Using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that the proportion of cells expressing adrenergic receptor isoforms does not differ significantly in hTERT-MSCs cells compared to the primary adMSCs culture. However, using analysis of Ca2+-mobilization in single cells, we found that these cells did not demonstrate the sensitization seen in primary adMSCs. Consistently, these cells did not activate cAMP synthesis in response to noradrenaline. These data indicate that immortalized adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell lines demonstrated impaired ability to respond to noradrenaline compared to primary adMSCs. These data draw attention to the usage of immortalized cells for MSCs-based regenerative medicine, especially in the field of pharmacology.

Mesenchymal Stem Cell Deformability and Implications for Microvascular Sequestration	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received considerable attention in regenerative medicine, particularly in light of prospects for targeted delivery by intra-arterial injection. However, little is known about the mechanics of MSC sequestration in the microvasculature and the yield pressure (P (Y)), above which MSCs will pass through microvessels of a given diameter. The objectives of the current study were to delineate the dependency of P-Y on cell size and the heterogeneity of cell mechanical properties and diameters (D (CELL)) of cultured MSCs. To this end the transient filtration test was employed to elucidate the mean filtration pressure (< P-Y >) for an ensemble of pores of a given size (D (PORE)) similar to in vivo microvessels. Cultured MSCs had a log-normal distribution of cell diameters (D (CELL)) with a mean of 15.8 +/- 0.73 SD mu m. MSC clearance from track-etched polycarbonate filters was studied for pore diameters of 7.3-15.4 mu m. The pressure required to clear cells from filters with 30-85 x 10(3) pores rose exponentially with the ratio lambda = D (CELL) /D (PORE) for 1.1 <= lambda <= 2.2. The clearance of cells from each filter was characterized by a log-normal distribution in P (Y), with a mean filtration pressure of 0.02 <= < P-Y > <= 6.7 cmH(2)O. For lambda <= 1.56, the yield pressure (P-Y) was well represented by the cortical shell model of a cell with a viscous interior encapsulated by a shell under cortical tension tau(0) = 0.99 +/- 0.42 SD dyn/cm. For lambda > 1.56, the < P-Y > characteristic of the cell population rose exponentially with lambda. Analysis of the mean filtration pressure (< P-Y >) of each sample suggested that the larger diameter cells that skewed the distribution of D (CELL) contributed to about 20% of the mean filtration pressure. Further, if all cells had the same deformability (i.e., P (Y) as a function of lambda) as the average cell population, then < P-Y > would have risen an order of magnitude above the average from fivefold at lambda = 1.56 to 200-fold at lambda = 2.1. Comparison of < P-Y > to published microvascular pressures suggested that < P-Y > may exceed microvessel pressure drops for lambda exceeding 2.1, and rise 14-fold above capillary pressure drop at lambda = 3 leading to 100% sequestration. However, due to the large variance of in vivo microvascular pressures entrapment of MSCs may be mitigated. Thus it is suggested that selecting fractions of the MSC population according to cell deformability may permit optimization of entrapment at sites targeted for tissue regeneration.				; Bowers, Daniel T/I-6337-2015	Lipowsky, Herbert/0000-0002-3379-7533; Bowers, Daniel T/0000-0003-0199-7714												0090-6964	1573-9686				APR	2018	46	4					640	654		10.1007/s10439-018-1985-y							WOS:000427981100010	29352448

Does osteogenic potential of clonal human bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells correlate with their vascular supportive ability?	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												BackgroundHuman bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hBM MSCs) have multiple functions, critical for skeletal formation and function. Their functional heterogeneity, however, represents a major challenge for their isolation and in developing potency and release assays to predict their functionality prior to transplantation. Additionally, potency, biomarker profiles and defining mechanisms of action in a particular clinical setting are increasing requirements of Regulatory Agencies for release of hBM MSCs as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products for cellular therapies. Since the healing of bone fractures depends on the coupling of new blood vessel formation with osteogenesis, we hypothesised that a correlation between the osteogenic and vascular supportive potential of individual hBM MSC-derived CFU-F (colony forming unit-fibroblastoid) clones might exist.MethodsWe tested this by assessing the lineage (i.e. adipogenic (A), osteogenic (O) and/or chondrogenic (C)) potential of individual hBM MSC-derived CFU-F clones and determining if their osteogenic (O) potential correlated with their vascular supportive profile in vitro using lineage differentiation assays, endothelial-hBM MSC vascular co-culture assays and transcriptomic (RNAseq) analyses.ResultsOur results demonstrate that the majority of CFU-F (95%) possessed tri-lineage, bi-lineage or uni-lineage osteogenic capacity, with 64% of the CFU-F exhibiting tri-lineage AOC potential. We found a correlation between the osteogenic and vascular tubule supportive activity of CFU-F clones, with the strength of this association being donor dependent. RNAseq of individual clones defined gene fingerprints relevant to this correlation.ConclusionsThis study identified a donor-dependent correlation between osteogenic and vascular supportive potential of hBM MSCs and important gene signatures that support these functions that are relevant to their bone regenerative properties.

CSCs can originate from differentiated adult cells that return to an undifferentiated stage through the mechanism known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this paper, we evaluated cellular and molecular heterogeneity and the participation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioblastoma (U-87 MG and LN-18) and neuroblastoma (KELLY and IMR-32) cell lines cultured in monolayer (2D) and neurosphere (CSC enrichment- 3D) models. For this, after treatment with cisplatin, we studied different cell subpopulations by immunophenotyping using neural stem cell/progenitor markers (ALDH, CD24, CD56, and CD133), mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD146) and hematopoietic markers (CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR) and mRNA expression profiles of genes related to EMT, such as ZEB1, TWIST1, TGEB1, STAT3, and lncRNA HOTAIR. In addition, we evaluated the growth capacity of residual cells when treated with cisplatin using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to study disease relapse. After treatment with cisplatin, we found that the expression of STAT3 and TGEB1 genes markedly increased in the neurosphere of the IMR-32 cell line, and TWIST1 was upregulated in the neurosphere of LN-18. Only the nontreated monolayer of LN-18, KELLY, and IMR-32 amplified the lncRNA HOTAIR. The IMR-32 cell line exhibited an enrichment of CD24(+)/ALDH(+) and this cell subset decreased after cisplatin treatment. We observed the loss of CD146 +/CD73 + cell subpopulations in U-87 MG monolayer and neurosphere models, after cisplatin treatment, while in LN-18 monolayer cisplatin-treated cells, CD73 + /CD90+ cell subpopulations increased. Neuroblastoma cell lines showed CD14(+)/HLA-DR- cell subpopulations representative of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Tumors generated from residual cells, after exposure to cisplatin, grafted on CAM showed patterns of organization different from those of the controls. Thus, our findings strongly supported the idea that definitions of tumor phenotypic characteristics may help to establish better therapeutic strategies for the development of new drug targets.

Cell Surface Glycoprotein CD24 Marks Bone Marrow-Derived Human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells with Reduced Proliferative and Differentiation Capacity In Vitro	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT												Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) are fundamental to bone regenerative therapies, tissue engineering, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. Donor variation among patients, cell heterogeneity, and unpredictable capacity for differentiation reduce effectiveness of BMSCs for regenerative cell therapies. The cell surface glycoprotein CD24 exhibits the most prominent differential expression during osteogenic versus adipogenic differentiation of human BMSCs. Therefore, CD24 may represent a selective biomarker for subpopulations of BMSCs with increased osteoblastic potential. In undifferentiated human BMSCs, CD24 cell surface expression is variable among donors (range: 2%-10%) and increased by two to fourfold upon osteogenic differentiation. Strikingly, FACS sorted CD24(pos) cells exhibit delayed mineralization and reduced capacity for adipocyte differentiation. RNAseq analysis of CD24(pos) and CD24(neg) BMSCs identified a limited number of genes with increased expression in CD24(pos) cells that are associated with cell adhesion, motility, and extracellular matrix. Downregulated genes are associated with cell cycle regulation, and biological assays revealed that CD24(pos) cells have reduced proliferation. Hence, expression of the cell surface glycoprotein CD24 identifies a subpopulation of human BMSCs with reduced capacity for proliferation and extracellular matrix mineralization. Functional specialization among BMSCs populations may support their regenerative potential and therapeutic success by accommodating cell activities that promote skeletal tissue formation, homeostasis, and repair.				van Wijnen, Andre J./AAG-3578-2019; Matos, Adriana Arruda/F-4188-2018	van Wijnen, Andre J./0000-0002-4458-0946; Matos, Adriana Arruda/0000-0002-2823-7769; Dudakovic, Amel/0000-0002-8850-3977												1547-3287	1557-8534				MAR 15	2021	30	6					325	336		10.1089/scd.2021.0027							WOS:000629716900003	33593128

Investigation of early cell-surface interactions of human mesenchymal stem cells on nanopatterned beta-type titanium-niobium alloy surfaces	INTERFACE FOCUS												Multi-potent adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow have therapeutic potential for bone diseases and regenerative medicine. However, an intrinsic heterogeneity in their phenotype, which in turn results in various differentiation potentials, makes it difficult to predict the response of these cells. The aim of this study is to investigate initial cell-surface interactions of human MSCs on modified titanium alloys. Gold nanoparticles deposited on beta-type Ti-40Nb alloys by block copolymer micelle nanolithography served as nanotopographical cues as well as specific binding sites for the immobilization of thiolated peptides present in several extracellular matrix proteins. MSC heterogeneity persists on polished and nanopatterned Ti-40Nb samples. However, cell heterogeneity and donor variability decreased upon functionalization of the gold nanoparticles with cyclic RGD peptides. In particular, the number of large cells significantly decreased after 24 h owing to the arrangement of cell anchorage sites, rather than peptide specificity. However, the size and number of integrin-mediated adhesion clusters increased in the presence of the integrin-binding peptide (cRGDfK) compared with the control peptide (cRADfK). These results suggest that the use of integrin ligands in defined patterns could improve MSC-material interactions, not only by regulating cell adhesion locally, but also by reducing population heterogeneity.

Mouse satellite cells from freshly isolated single myofibers, cultured individually in serum-rich growth medium, produced myogenic and non-myogenic clones. Only the myogenic clones expressed muscle-specific transcription factors and formed myotubes. Pax7 was initially expressed in all clones, but subsequently was associated only with the myogenic clones. Some cells in the non-myogenic clones expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin and nestin whereas others differentiated into mature adipocytes. This type of cell composition mirrors characteristics of mesenchymal stem cell progeny. Overall, individual myofibers; persistently gave rise to both clonal phenotypes, but the ratio of myogenic to non-myogenic clones randomly varied among fibers. This randomness indicates that clonal dichotomy reflects satellite cell suppleness rather than pre-fated cell heterogeneity. We conclude that satellite cells possess mesenchymal plasticity, being able to commit either to myogenesis or to a mesenchymal alternative differentiation (MAD) program.																	0021-9533	1477-9137				OCT 15	2004	117	22					5393	5404		10.1242/jcs.01419							WOS:000225414100020	15466890

Recent experiments show that cells with varying EMT and CSC phenotypes are spatially segregated in the primary tumor. The underlying mechanisms generating such spatiotemporal dynamics in the tumor microenvironment, however, remain largely unexplored. Here, we show through a mechanism-based dynamical model that the diffusion of EMT-inducing signals such as TGF-beta, together with noncell autonomous control of EMT and CSC decision making via the Notch signaling pathway, can explain experimentally observed disparate localization of subsets of CSCs with varying EMT phenotypes in the tumor. Our simulations show that the more mesenchymal CSCs lie at the invasive edge, while the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) CSCs reside in the tumor interior. Further, motivated by the role of Notch-Jagged signaling in mediating EMT and sternness, we investigated the microenvironmental factors that promote Notch-Jagged signaling. We show that many inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 that can promote Notch-Jagged signaling can (i) stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype, (ii) increase the likelihood of spatial proximity of hybrid E/M cells, and (iii) expand the fraction of CSCs. To validate the predicted connection between Notch-Jagged signaling and sternness, we knocked down JAG1 in hybrid E/M SUM149 human breast cancer cells in vitro. JAG1 knockdown significantly restricted tumor organoid formation, confirming the key role that Notch-Jagged signaling can play in tumor progression. Together, our integrated computational-experimental framework reveals the underlying principles of spatiotemporal dynamics of EMT and CSCs.

This study was carried out to assess the research status and explore the hotspots and trends regarding hUC-MSCs using bibliometric methods. Methods: Publications on hUC-MSCs were retrieved from the PubMed database. Then, we used Bibliographic Item Co-occurrence Matrix Builder to build the term-source and co-occurrence matrices by analyzing and identifying highly frequent MeSH terms. Biclustering analysis was next performed using the gCLUTO software. Mountain visualization and matrix visualization were used to present the clustering results. Finally, to evaluate the status and trends of each cluster, we plotted a strategic diagram based on the co-word analysis. Results: According to the selection criteria, a total of 2671 articles on hUC-MSCs were included. In the extracted MeSH terms, the researchers identified 31 high frequency MeSH terms. The results of subsequent biclustering analysis revealed 3 clusters and 8 hotspots of hUC-MSCs research. As for the strategic diagram, the role and position of each cluster were displayed by centrality and density. Studies on methods of culture and separation of hUC-MSCs as well as heterogeneity of human mesenchymal stem cells were well-developed. On the contrary, characterization of hUC-MSCs, methods and therapeutic potentials of umbilical cord stem cells transplantation, methods and promising applications of hUC-MSCs in tissue engineering were at the cutting edge of hUC-MSCs research. Conclusion: The fields of hUC-MSCs have broader application prospects in clinical applications, especially for diseases that are not clinically curable, such as immune system diseases and metabolic diseases. However, high treatment costs are a huge challenge, so how to reduce treatment costs will be a focus of future research.																	2157-9083	2157-9091				FEB	2019	9	2					221	229		10.1166/jbt.2019.1966							WOS:000469385800012

However, the results of those studies were inconsistent. To clarify the beneficial effects of atorvastatin added to the cell therapy with MSCs in animal model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies. Methods: Searches were performed using the PubMed database, the Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), the Science Citation Index, the China National Knowledge Information database, the Wanfang database, and the Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database (VIP database). The search term included "Atorvastatin (or Ator)", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells (or Mesenchymal Stem Cell or MSC or MSCs)" and "Acute Myocardial Infarction (or Myocardial Infarction or AMI or MI)". The endpoints were the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in animal model with AMI. Results: In total, 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis indicated a significant LVEF difference at 4 weeks follow-up between MSCs + ATOR combine group and MSCs alone group (95 % CI, 9.09-13.62 %; P < 0.01) with heterogeneity (P = 0.28; P > 0.05) and inconsistency (I-2: 22 %). Conclusions: Atorvastatin can enhance the existing effects of MSCs transplantation, and this combinational therapy is a superior cell/pharmacological therapeutic approach that merits future preclinical and clinical studies.																	1471-2261					DEC 14	2015	15								170	10.1186/s12872-015-0162-6							WOS:000366250700001	26667804

Bioinstructive microparticles for self-assembly of mesenchymal stem Cell-3D tumor spheroids	BIOMATERIALS												3D multicellular tumor spheroids (3D-MCTS) that closely mimic in vitro the complex lung tumor micro environment (TME) are highly desirable for screening innovative anti-cancer therapeutics. Despite significant improvements in mimicking lung TME, few models have combined tumor-infiltrating mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow (hBM-MSCs) with heterotypic 3D tumor spheroid models containing ECM mimetic components. Herein, we engineered hybrid 3D-MCTS that combine, for the first time, A549:fibroblasts:hBM-MSCs in heterotypic tri-culture, with bioinstructive hyaluronan microparticles that act as tumor-ECM mimetics and as cell-anchoring hotspots. The obtained results indicated that 3D microspheres provided proper support for cells to self-assemble into compact 3D microtissues and promoted an increase in CD44 expression, emulating the presence of native-ECM hyaluronan. 3D-MCTS size and sphere-like morphology was reproducible and tri-culture models presented the characteristic solid tumors necrotic core. Mesenchymal stem cells tracking demonstrated that hBM-MSCs migrate to different regions in 3D microtumors mass exhibiting dynamic interactions with cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts, alike in human tumors. Importantly, doxorubicin administration revealed hBM-MSCs effect on cytotoxic responses in 3D tri-culture models and in dual cultures of hBM-MSCs:A549 at 10:1 ratio. Such findings evidence the relevance of including hBM-MSCs in combination with cancer-stromal fibroblasts in 3D in vitro tumor models and the importance to test different cell-to-cell ratios to mimic tumor heterogeneity. In addition, bioinstructive hyaluronan-microparticles were also effective as cell-agglomerating scaffolds and showed potential to be used as an enabling technology for including different ECM components in 3D in vitro models in the future.

Emergent heterogeneity in putative mesenchymal stem cell colonies: Single-cell time lapsed analysis	PLOS ONE												Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) include a subset of stem cells that are considered promising for developmental studies and therapeutic applications. While it is appreciated generally that BMSC populations can exhibit morphological and functional heterogeneity upon in vitro culture expansion, the potential for heterogeneity within a single colony forming unit-generated ostensibly from a single mother cell-is less explored but is critical to design of both fundamental studies and cell therapy production. Here we observed BMSC colony formation in real time via time lapsed optical imaging and analysis, to quantify whether and how heterogeneity emerged over multiple cell divisions spanning the duration of a typical colony formation unit assay. These analyses demonstrate that such colonies are neither homogeneous subpopulations of stem cells nor necessarily derived from single originating cells. While the mechanisms for and causes of this intracolony heterogeneity are not understood fully, we further demonstrate that extensive cell-cell contacts do not correlate with senescence, but that media exchange was concurrent with diversification in even the most uniform single-cell-derived colonies. These direct quantitative observations and visualizations of colony formation provide new insights that are motivated by significant implications for both basic research and stem cell-based therapies.

The complex heterogeneity of this microenvironment varies depending on the tumor type and its origins. However, most of the existing cancerbased studies have focused on cancer cells. In this study, we used a direct co-culture system (cross-talk signaling) to induce cross-interaction between cancer cells and mesenchymal stem cells. This induced deformation of MSCs. MSCs showed a diminished ability to maintain homeostasis. In particular, increase in the invasion ability of MSCs by TGF-ss 1 and decrease in p53, which plays a key role in cancer development, is an important discovery. It can thus be deduced that blocking these changes can effectively inhibit metastatic colorectal cancer. In conclusion, understanding the interactions and changes in MSCs associated with cancer will help develop novel therapeutic strategies for cancer.																	0916-8451	1347-6947				FEB 1	2020	84	2					256	267		10.1080/09168451.2019.1676692		OCT 2019					WOS:000492221100001	31601153

Expressions of different cell surface markers confer distinct differentiation potential to different sub populations of MSCs. Understanding the effect of cell surface markers on MSC differentiation is essential to their targeted application in different tissues. Although CD105 positive MSCs possess strong chondrogenic capacity, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we observed a considerable heterogeneity with respect to CD105 expression among MSCs isolated from synovium. The CD105(+) and CD105(-) synovium-derived MSCs (SMSCs) were sorted to compare their differentiation capacities and relative gene expressions. CD105(+) subpopulation had higher gene expressions of AGG, COL II and Sox9, and showed a stronger affinity for Alcian blue and immunofluorescent staining for aggrecan and collagenase II, as compared to those in CD105(-) cells. However, no significant difference was observed with respect to gene expressions of ALP, Runx2, LPL and PPARy. CD105(+) SMSCs showed increased levels of Smad2 phosphorylation, while total Smad2 levels were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in activation of Smad1/5. These results were further confirmed by CD105-knockdown in SMSCs. Our findings suggest a stronger chondrogenic potential of CD105(+) SMSCs in comparison to that of CD105(-) SMSCs and that CD105 enhances chondrogenesis of SMSCs by regulating TGF-beta/Smad2 signaling pathway, but not Smad1/5. Our study provides a better understanding of CD105 with respect to chondrogenic differentiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Co-transplantation experiments with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adult human tissues including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), and umbilical cord blood (CB) were conducted. We showed that AT-MSCs and CB-MSCs enhanced the engraftment of HSCs as effectively as BM-MSCs in NOD/SCID mice, suggesting that AT-MSCs and CB-MSCs can be used as alternative stem cell sources for enhancing the engraftment and homing of HSCs. CB-MSCs derived from different donors showed different degrees of efficacy in enhancing the engraftment of HSCs. The most effective CB-MSCs showed higher proliferation rates and secreted more MCP-1, RANTES, EGF, and VEGF. Our results suggest that AT-MSCs and CB-MSCs could be alternative stem cell sources for co-transplantation in HSCT. Furthermore, in terms of MSCs' heterogeneity, characteristics of each population of MSCs are considerable factors for selecting MSCs suitable for co-transplantation with HSC.

These cell types support and regulate the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and communicate with leukemic cells through the release of proteins to their common extracellular microenvironment. One of the AML-supporting normal cell types is a subset of connective tissue cells called mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, we observed that AML cells release a wide range of diverse proteins into their microenvironment, but patients differ both with regard to the number and amount of released proteins. Inhibition of this bidirectional communication through protein release between AML cells and leukemia-supporting normal cells may become a new strategy for cancer treatment. Extracellular protein release is important both for the formation of extracellular matrix and for communication between cells. We investigated the extracellular protein release by in vitro cultured normal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and by primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells derived from 40 consecutive patients. We observed quantifiable levels of 3082 proteins in our study; for the MSCs, we detected 1446 proteins, whereas the number of released proteins for the AML cells showed wide variation between patients (average number 1699, range 557-2380). The proteins were derived from various cellular compartments (e.g., cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasms), several organelles (e.g., cytoskeleton, endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria) and had various functions (e.g., extracellular matrix and exosomal proteins, cytokines, soluble adhesion molecules, protein synthesis, post-transcriptional modulation, RNA binding, and ribonuclear proteins). Thus, AML patients were very heterogeneous both regarding the number of proteins and the nature of their extracellularly released proteins. The protein release profiles of MSCs and primary AML cells show a considerable overlap, but a minority of the proteins are released only or mainly by the MSC, including several extracellular matrix molecules. Taken together, our observations suggest that the protein profile of the extracellular bone marrow microenvironment differs between AML patients, these differences are mainly caused by the protein release by the leukemic cells but this leukemia-associated heterogeneity of the overall extracellular protein profile is modulated by the constitutive protein release by normal MSCs.

The population residing in muscles is heterogenic. Predominant in number are "typical" satellite cells - muscle progenitors migrating from somites during embryonic life. Another population is group of multipotent muscle stem cells which, at least in part, are derived from bone marrow. These cells are tracked by gradient of growth factors releasing from muscle during injury or exercise. Recruited bone marrow-derived cells gradually change their phenotype becoming muscle stem cells and eventually can attain satellite cell position and express Pax7 protein. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated directly from bone marrow also display myogenic potential, although methods of induction of myogenic differentiation in vitro have not been optimized yet. Concerning efforts of exploiting myogenic stem cells in cell-mediated therapies it is important to understand the cause of impaired regenerative potential of aged muscle. Up to now, most of research data suggest that majority of age related changes in skeletal muscles are reversible, thus depending on extrinsic factors. However, irreversible intrinsic features of muscle stem cells are also taken into consideration.

Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Subpopulations and Their Difference in Cell Biology and Effects on Retinal Degeneration in RCS Rats	CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE												Background: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are potential candidates for treating retinal degeneration (RD). Objective: To further study the biology and therapeutic effects of the hUC-MSCs on retinal degeneration. Methods: Two hUC-MSC subpopulations, termed hUC-MSC1 and hUC-MSC2, were isolated by single-cell cloning method and their therapeutic functions were compared in RCS rat, a RD model. Results: Although both subsets satisfied the basic requirements for hUC-MSCs, they were significantly different in morphology, proliferation rate, differentiation capacity, phenotype and gene expression. Furthermore, only the smaller, fibroblast-like, faster growing subset hUC-MSC1 displayed stronger colony forming potential as well as adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacities. When the two subsets were respectively transplanted into the subretinal spaces of RCS rats, both subsets survived, but only hUC-MSC1 expressed RPE cell markers Bestrophin and RPE65. More importantly, hUC-MSC1 showed stronger rescue effect on the retinal function as indicated by the higher b-wave amplitude on ERG examination, thicker retinal nuclear layer, and decreased apoptotic photoreceptors. When both subsets were treated with interleukin-6, mimicking the inflammatory environment when the cells were transplanted into the eyes with degenerated retina, hUC-MSC1 expressed much higher levels of trophic factors in comparison with hUC-MSC2. Conclusion: The data here, in addition to prove the heterogeneity of hUC-MSCs, confirmed that the stronger therapeutic effects of hUC-MSC1 were attributed to its stronger anti-apoptotic effect, paracrine of trophic factors and potential RPE cell differentiation capacity. Thus, the subset hUC-MSC1, not the other subset or the un-grouped hUC-MSCs should be used for effective treatment of RD.																	1566-5240	1875-5666					2017	17	6					421	435		10.2174/1566524018666171205140806							WOS:000424636300003	29210653

We hypothesize that this contradiction is due to the heterogeneity of MSC subsets and that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from distinct MSC subsets can transfer the corresponding antitumor activities. Here we evaluated the antitumor activities of two subsets of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and ADSC-derived EVs (ADSC-EVs) in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of breast cancer. We identified CD90(high) and CD90(low) ADSC subsets and demonstrated that CD90(high) ADSCs could be converted into CD90(low) ADSCs by stimulation with LPS. CD90(low) ADSCs and its derived EVs significantly inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Benefit of tumor control were associated with decreased tumor cell proliferation and migration, and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis mediated by ADSC-EVs. Antioncogenic miRNA-16-5p loaded CD90(low) ADSC-EVs further significantly enhanced antitumor activities. Taken together, this study represents the first attempt to apply our newly identified antitumor ADSCs and its derived EVs in preclinical treatment of breast cancer. This study also provides the evidence that EVs can serve as a novel and effective therapeutics or drug delivery vesicle. This new therapeutic approach could be potentially applicable to breast cancer and many other types of cancer.																	1043-6618					JUL	2020	157								104843	10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104843							WOS:000538778100002	32360582

As well as building up the musculoskeletal system in early life, MSCs also replenish and repair tissues in adult life, such as bone, cartilage, muscle, and adipose tissue. Cells that show regenerative features at least in vitro have been identified from several connective tissues. Bone marrow and adipose tissue are the most well recognized sources of MSCs that are already used widely in clinical practice. Regenerative medicine aims to exploit MSCs and their tissue regeneration even though the underlying mechanisms for their beneficial effects are largely unknown. Despite many studies that have used various tissue-derived MSCs, the most effective tissue source for orthopedic procedures still remains to be identified. Another question that needs to be addressed is how to evaluate autologous MSCs (i.e., patient derived). Previous studies have suggested the features of bone-marrow-derived MSCs can differ widely between individuals, and can be changed in particular in patients suffering from some forms of degenerative disorder, such as osteoarthritis. The synovium is a thin membrane that protects the synovial joints, and it is a rich source of MSCs that show great potential for regenerative medicine. Here, we review synovium-derived MSCs from reports on basic and clinical studies. We discuss their potential to treat cartilage defects caused by either degeneration or trauma, and what needs to be done in further research toward their better exploitation for joint regeneration.

We hypothesize that co-culturing HAMEC:MSC on a porous biodegradable scaffold in vitro, later implanted as a graft around femoral blood vessels in a rat, will result in its vascularization by host vessels, creating a functional vascular flap that can effectively treat a range of large full-thickness soft tissue defects. HAMEC were co-cultured with MSC on polymeric three-dimensional porous constructs. Grafts were then implanted around the femoral vessels of a rat. To ensure vessel sprouting from the main femoral vessels, grafts were pre-isolated from the surrounding tissue. Graft vascularization was monitored to confirm full vascularization before flap transfer. Flaps were then transferred to treat both abdominal wall and exposed bone and tendon of an ankle defects. Flaps were analysed to determine vascular properties in terms of maturity, functionality and survival of implanted cells. Findings show that pre-isolated grafts bearing the HAMEC:MSC combination promoted formation of highly vascularized flaps, which were better integrated in both defect models. The results of this study show the essentiality of a specific adipose-derived cell combination in successful graft vascularization and integration, two processes crucial for flap survival.

Morphological monitoring allows practical quality maintenance in cell manufacturing facilities, but relies heavily on human skill. For more reproducible and data-driven quality evaluation, image-based morphological analysis provides multiple advantages over manual observation. Our group has investigated the performance of multiple morphological parameters obtained from time-course images to non-invasively and quantitatively predict cellular quality using machine learning algorithms. Although such morphology-based computational models succeeded in early cell quality predictions, it was difficult to introduce our approach in cell manufacturing facilities owing to data variation issues. Since manufacturing facilities have fixed their protocol to minimize anomalies as much as possible, most accumulated data are normal, and anomalies are scarce. Thus, our morphological analysis had to adapt to such practical situation where it was difficult to observe a wide range of data variations, including both normal samples and anomalies, which is typically essential to improve most machine learning models' performance. In the present study, we introduce a practical morphological analysis concept by investigating the performance of anomalous quality decay discrimination during the continuous passaging of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Combining the visualization method and asymmetric statistic discrimination, we describe an effective morphology-based, in-process quality monitoring concept to detect quality anomalies throughout cell culture process. Our results showed that the use of morphological parameters to reflect cellular population heterogeneity can predict hMSC quality decay within 6 h after seeding.

Bone Marrow Regeneration Promoted by Biophysically Sorted Osteoprogenitors From Mesenchymal Stromal Cells	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												Human tissue repair deficiencies can be supplemented through strategies to isolate, expand in vitro, and reimplant regenerative cells that supplant damaged cells or stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a subset of which is described as mesenchymal stem cells, are leading candidates for cell-mediated bone repair and wound healing, with hundreds of ongoing clinical trials worldwide. An outstanding key challenge for successful clinical translation of MSCs is the capacity to produce large quantities of cells in vitro with uniform and relevant therapeutic properties. By leveraging biophysical traits of MSC subpoptilations and label-free microfluidic cell sorting, we hypothesized and experimentally verified that MSCs of large diameter within expanded MSC cultures were osteoprogenitors that exhibited significantly greater efficacy over other MSC subpopulations in bone marrow repair. Systemic administration of osteoprogenitor MSCs significantly improved survival rates (>80%) as compared with other MSC subpopulations (0%) for preclinical murine bone marrow injury models. Osteoprogenitor MSCs also exerted potent therapeutic effects as "cell factories" that secreted high levels of regenerative factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8.(IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor A, bone rnorphogenetic protein 2, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast grolivth factor 1, and angiopoietin-1; this resulted in increased cell proliferation, vessel formation, and reduced apoptosis in bone marrow. This MSC subpopulation mediated rescue of damaged marrow tissue via restoration of the hematopoiesis-supporting stroma, as well as subsequent hematopoiesis. Together, the capabilities described herein for label-freeisolation of regenerative osteoprogenitor MSCs can markedly improve the efficacy of MSC-based therapies.

Chorionic plate MSCs (CP-MSCs), amniotic membrane MSCs (AM-MSCs), and decidual plate MSCs (DP-MSCs) were isolated from 5 human placentae and were analyzed in terms of main features of MSCs including surface marker profile, growth, differentiation potential, immune regulation capability, and tubulin acetylation (Ac-tubulin). The expression profile of surface markers in the 3 types of MSCs derived from the 5 donors was relatively stable. Heterogeneity was found in growth, differentiation potential, and immune regulation among MSCs according to the different areas of isolation and different donors. CP-MSCs and AM-MSCs derived from the placentae of donors 1-3 had a higher osteogenic differentiation potential than the corresponding DP-MSCs, but those derived from the placentae of donors 4 and 5 had a markedly lower osteogenic differentiation potential than DP-MSCs. All CP-MSCs derived from donors 1-3 had the highest adipogenic differentiation potential, but CP-MSCs derived from donors 4 and 5 did not show strong capability of adipogenic differentiation. CP-MSCs markedly inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by phytohemagglutinin, whereas AM- and DP-MSCs did not. All MSCs decreased the proportion of CD3+/CD8-/IFN-gamma+ Th1 and CD3+/CD8-/IL17+ Th17 cells, but increased the proportion of Treg cells in PBMCs, with individual differences among the 5 donors. DP-MSCs from donors 1 and 2 had higher levels of Ac-tubulin compared with CP- and AM-MSCs. However, the levels of Ac-tubulin in AM-MSCs from donors 3 and 5 were higher than those of the other 2 types of MSCs. Our results revealed that there was tissue-specific heterogeneity among the 3 types of MSCs from different origin tissues of placenta and individual heterogeneity among donors. In future, the pre-selected placenta-derived MSCs with specific biological advantages may improve the curative effect of cell therapy in different situations.																	1422-6405	1422-6421															10.1159/000513038		MAR 2021					WOS:000635756000001	33780947

Cells were cultured in medium that had been selected for its effect on observed MSC proliferation, until populations of greater than 50 million had been obtained from each biopsy. The identity of the isolated cell populations as progenitors of the mesenchymal lineage was verified by deriving both osteoblastic and chondrocytic phenotypes when cultured in osteogenic and chondrogenic medium supplements, respectively. The rate of cell proliferation for each marrow biopsy was measured at each passage and the number of initial stem cells in each sample estimated. There was no statistically significant correlation between the age of the sheep and MSC proliferative potential, or age and estimated initial MSC number. There was no apparent significant difference between proliferation rate and sheep breed and colonies established from frozen cells grew at similar rates to pre-frozen cells. Counter intuitively, there appeared to be a negatively correlated trend between proliferation rate and MSC concentration in the samples. It is concluded that no initial descriptive statistics of the marrow biopsies can assist in estimating the proliferative potential, and therefore the timing of future surgeries, of MSCs sampled for the purposes of tissue engineering.

Functional consequences of glucose and oxygen deprivation on engineered mesenchymal stem cell-based cartilage constructs	OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE												Objective: Tissue engineering approaches for cartilage repair have focused on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). For clinical success, MSCs must survive and produce extracellular matrix in the physiological context of the synovial joint, where low nutrient conditions engendered by avascularity, nutrient utilization, and waste production prevail. This study sought to delineate the role of microenvironmental stressors on MSC viability and functional capacity in three dimensional (3D) culture. Design: We evaluated the impact of glucose and oxygen deprivation on the functional maturation of 3D MSC-laden agarose constructs. Since MSC isolation procedures result in a heterogeneous cell population, we also utilized micro-pellet culture to investigate whether clonal subpopulations respond to these microenvironmental stressors in a distinct fashion. Results: MSC health and the functional maturation of 3D constructs were compromised by both glucose and oxygen deprivation. Importantly, glucose deprivation severely limited viability, and so compromised the functional maturation of 3D constructs to the greatest extent. The observation that not all cells died suggested there exists heterogeneity in the response of MSC populations to metabolic stressors. Population heterogeneity was confirmed through a series of studies utilizing clonally derived subpopulations, with a spectrum of matrix production and cell survival observed under conditions of metabolic stress. Conclusions: Our findings show that glucose deprivation has a significant impact on functional maturation, and that some MSC subpopulations are more resilient to metabolic challenge than others. These findings suggest that pre-selection of subpopulations that are resilient to metabolic challenge may improve in vivo outcomes. (C) 2014 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

During peritoneal carcinomatosis ovarian cancer cells interact with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) resulting in increased metastatic ability. Understanding the transcriptomic changes underlying the phenotypic modulation will allow identification of key genes to target. However in the context of personalized medicine we must consider inter and intra tumoral heterogeneity. In this study we used a pathway-based approach to illustrate the role of cell line background in transcriptomic modification during a cross talk with MSC. Methods: We used two ovarian cancer cell lines as a surrogate for different ovarian cancer subtypes: OVCAR3 for an epithelial and SKOV3 for a mesenchymal subtype. We co-cultured them with MSCs. Genome wide gene expression was determined after cell sorting. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to decipher the cell specific transcriptomic changes related to different pro-metastatic traits (Adherence, migration, invasion, proliferation and chemoresistance). Results: We demonstrate that co-culture of ovarian cancer cells in direct cellular contact with MSCs induces broad transcriptomic changes related to enhance metastatic ability. Genes related to cellular adhesion, invasion, migration, proliferation and chemoresistance were enriched under these experimental conditions. Network analysis of differentially expressed genes clearly shows a cell type specific pattern. Conclusion: The contact with the mesenchymal niche increase metastatic initiation and expansion through cancer cells' transcriptome modification dependent of the cellular subtype. Personalized medicine strategy might benefit from network analysis revealing the subtype specific nodes to target to disrupt acquired pro-metastatic profile.

ROCK1 Inhibition Promotes the Self-Renewal of a Novel Mouse Mammary Cancer Stem Cell	STEM CELLS												The differentiation of stem-like tumor cells may contribute to the cellular heterogeneity of breast cancers. We report the propagation of highly enriched mouse mammary cancer stem cells that retain the potential to differentiate both in vivo and in culture and their use to identify chemical compounds that influence both self-renewal and differentiation. We identify epithelial tumor-initiating cells (ETICs) that express lineage markers of both basal and luminal mammary cell lineages and retain the potential, from even single cells, to generate heterogeneous tumors similar to the tumor of origin. ETICs can progress through a Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 dependent, epithelial to mesenchymal transition to generate mesenchymal tumor-initiating cells capable of initiating tumors of limited heterogeneity. The propagation of ETICs may allow for the identification of new therapeutic compounds that may inhibit or prevent progression of some types of breast cancer.

While most studies have focussed on the anti-inflammatory roles of MSCs in stem cell therapy, the impaired features of MSCs, such as the loss of homeostasis by systemic aging or pathologic conditions, remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated whether the altered phenotypes of human placenta-derived MSCs (hPD-MSCs) exposed to inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, could be protected by MIT-001, a small anti-inflammatory and anti-necrotic molecule. MIT-001 promoted the spindle-like shape and cytoskeletal organization extending across the long cell axis, whereas hPD-MSCs exposed to TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma exhibited increased morphological heterogeneity with an abnormal cell shape and cytoskeletal disorganization. Importantly, MIT-001 improved mitochondrial distribution across the cytoplasm. MIT-001 significantly reduced basal respiration, ATP production, and cellular ROS levels and augmented the spare respiratory capacity compared to TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-exposed hPD-MSCs, indicating enhanced mitochondrial quiescence and homeostasis. In conclusion, while TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-exposed MSCs lost homeostasis and mitochondrial quiescence by becoming over-activated in response to inflammatory cytokines, MIT-001 was able to rescue mitochondrial features and cellular phenotypes. Therefore, MIT-001 has therapeutic potential for clinical applications to treat mitochondrion-related inflammatory diseases.

Generation of MSC-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may circumvent these limitations, and such iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) are already tested in clinical trials. So far, a comparison of MSCs and iMSCs was particularly addressed in bulk culture. Despite the high hopes in cellular therapy, only little is known how the composition of different subclones changes in these cell preparations during culture expansion. Methods In this study, we used multicolor lentiviral genetic barcoding for the marking of individual cells within cell preparations. Based on this, we could track the clonal composition of syngenic MSCs, iPSCs, and iMSCs during culture expansion. Furthermore, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns at senescence-associated genomic regions by barcoded bisulfite amplicon sequencing. The proliferation and differentiation capacities of individual subclones within MSCs and iMSCs were investigated with limiting dilution assays. Results Overall, the clonal composition of primary MSCs and iPSCs gradually declined during expansion. In contrast, iMSCs became oligoclonal early during differentiation, indicating that they were derived from few individual iPSCs. This dominant clonal outgrowth of iMSCs was not associated with changes in chromosomal copy number variation. Furthermore, clonal dynamics were not clearly reflected by stochastically acquired DNA methylation patterns. Limiting dilution assays revealed that iMSCs are heterogeneous in colony formation and in vitro differentiation potential, while this was even more pronounced in primary MSCs. Conclusions Our results indicate that the subclonal diversity of MSCs and iPSCs declines gradually during in vitro culture, whereas derivation of iMSCs may stem from few individual iPSCs. Differentiation regimen needs to be further optimized to achieve homogeneous differentiation of iPSCs towards iMSCs.				, EFR1981/AAV-6334-2020	, EFR1981/0000-0002-4378-7590; Goetzke, Roman/0000-0002-1845-1083; Wagner, Wolfgang/0000-0002-1971-3217													1757-6512				MAR 5	2020	11	1							105	10.1186/s13287-020-01619-5							WOS:000519032200002	32138773

A novel drug conjugate, NEO212, targeting proneural and mesenchymal subtypes of patient-derived glioma cancer stem cells	CANCER LETTERS												Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, accounts for half of all gliomas. Despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the median survival is between 12 and 15 months. The poor prognosis is due to tumor recurrence attributed to chemoresistant glioma cancer stem cells (GSCs). Here we examined the effects of a novel compound NEO212, which is composed of two covalently conjugated anti-cancer compounds-temozolomide (TMZ) and perillyl alcohol (POH), on GSCs expressing either the proneural or mesenchymal gene signatures. These GSCs were obtained from patient-derived tumor tissue. Our findings demonstrate that NEO212 is 10 fold more cytotoxic to GSCs than TMZ (standard-of-care). Furthermore, NEO212 is effective against both proneural and clinically aggressive mesenchymal GSC subtypes. The mechanism of NEO212 mediated-cytotoxicity is through double-strand DNA breaks and apoptosis. In vivo studies show that NEO212 significantly delays tumor growth of both proneural and mesenchymal tumor stem cell populations. Patient-derived GSCs and tumors derived from these cells are highly reflective of the heterogeneity in human GBM. The efficacy of NEO212 against both GSC subtypes indicates that NEO212 has great clinical potential to effectively target GBM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We wished to clarify whether this unusual phenotype reflected a rare but dominant subpopulation or if the stem cell origin allowed most cells to behave as cancer stem cells. Cultures of the hMSC-TERT20 strain at population doubling 440 were highly clonogenic (94%). From 110 single-cell clones expanded by 20 population doublings, 6 underwent detailed comparison. Like the parental population, each clone had; approximate to 1.2 days doubling time with loss of contact inhibition. All retained 1,25-(OH)(2) vitamin D-3-induced expression of osteoblastic markers: collagen type 1, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. All shared INK4a/ARF gene locus deletion and epigenetic silencing of the DBCCR1 tumor suppressor gene. Despite in vitro commonality, only four of six clones shared the growth kinetics and 100% tumorigenicity of the parental population. In contrast, one clone consistently formed latent tumors and the other established tumors with only 30% penetrance. Changing the in vitro microenvironment to mimic in vivo growth aspects revealed concordant clonal heterogeneity. Latent tumor growth correlated with extracellular matrix entrapment of multicellular spheroids and high procollagen type III expression. Poor tumorigenicity correlated with in vitro serum dependence and high p27(Kip1) expression. Aggressive tumorigenicity correlated with good viability plus capillary morphogenesis on serum starvation and high cyclin D1 expression. Thus, hMSC-TERT20 clones represent cancer stem cells with hierarchical tumorigenicity, providing new models to explore the stem cell hypothesis for cancer.

Epithelial stem cells in hair follicles (HFs) have region-specific activity, which may arise from intrinsic cellular heterogeneity within mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity.

Although mouse animal models and murine MSCs are common tools in this field, our understanding of the effect of in vitro expansion on the behavior of these cells is poor and controversial. In addition, in comparison to human, isolation of MSCs from mouse has been reported to be more difficult and some unexplained features such as heterogeneity and slow growth rate in the culture of these cells have been observed. Here we followed mouse bone marrow MSCs for >1 year after isolation and examined the effect of expansion on changes in morphology, growth kinetics, plasticity, and chromosomal structure during in vitro culture. Shortly after isolation, the growth rate of the cells decreased until they stopped dividing and entered a dormant state. In this state the size of the cells increased and they became multinuclear. These large multinuclear cells then gave origin to small mononuclear cells, which after a while resumed proliferation and could be expanded immortally. The immortal cells had diminished plasticity and were aneuploid but could not form tumors in nude mice. These results suggest that mouse bone marrow MSCs bear several modifications when expanded in vitro, and therefore, the interpretation of the data obtained with these cells should be done more cautiously.

J	Hatina, J				Hatina, J.			The dynamics of cancer stem cells	NEOPLASMA												With the formulation of the hierarchical model of tumor cell organization, cancer stem cells came to the forefront of cancer biology. As the only self-renewing tumor cells, they were made responsible for continuous tumor growth and their intrinsic self-protection ability was postulated to underlie cancer therapy resistance and/or recurrence. The concept of migrating cancer stem cells extended the relevance of the hierarchical cancer cell model to issue of cancer progression, with the crucial experimental evidence being provided by the demonstration that epithelial mesenchymal transition can convey sternness. Accordingly, cancer stern cells probably represent a highly dynamic cell population continuously differentiating and being continuously replenished by processes like mesenchymal epithelial transition and epithelial mesenchymal transition, respectively. Consequently, from the point of view of therapeutic targeting, cancer stem cells obviously do not represent a fixed target population any longer. Understanding the dynamic nature of cancer stem cells is thus essential not only for the progress in our understanding of basic cancer biology, but also from the therapeutic perspective.																	0028-2685						2012	59	6					700	707		10.4149/neo_2012_092							WOS:000310820200014	22862171

STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												There has been great interest in research and clinical trials with the adult stem/progenitor cells referred to as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). However, there are no definitive markers for the cells and no assays that would reflect the therapeutic efficacy of the cells in vivo. There are in effect no adequate release criteria that define the quality or efficacy of the cells. The problems are compounded by the fact that a variety of different protocols has been used to isolate the cells and expand them in culture. The result is that many publications have used MSCs with different properties, frequently without the investigators being aware of the differences. As a partial solution to these problems, we have devised a simple table to record in-process data on the preparation of MSCs. We suggest that comparisons of data generated by different laboratories would be facilitated if similar in-process data, probably as supplemental materials, were included in publications using MSCs.																	2157-6564	2157-6580				MAY	2014	3	5					632	635		10.5966/sctm.2013-0203							WOS:000335939000019	24692588

However, the use of primary MSCs is hampered by a number of limitations, including donor heterogeneity and inconsistent cell quality. Here, we tested the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs (ES-MSCs) in anOA rat model. ES-MSCs were generated and identified by morphology, trilineage differentiation and flow cytometry. Sprague Dawley rats were treated with either a single dose (10(6) cells/rat) of ES-MSCs or with three doses spaced one week apart for each dose, starting at four weeks after anterior cruciate ligament transectionto induce OA. Cartilage quality was evaluated at 6 and 10 weeks after treatment with behavioral analysis, macroscopic examination, and histology. At sixweeks after treatment, the groups treated with both single and repeated doses of ES-MSCs had significantly better modified Mankin scores and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic scores in the femoral condyle compared to the control group. At 10 weeks after treatment, the repeated doses group had a significantly better ICRS macroscopic scores in the femoral condyle compared to the single dose and control groups. Histological analysis also showed more proteoglycan and less cartilage loss, along with lower Mankin scores in the repeated doses group. In conclusion, treatment with multiple injections of ES-MSCs can ameliorate OA in a rat model. TheES-MSCs have potential to be considered as a regenerative therapy for OA, and can provide an infinite cellular source.

Molecular and proteomic characterization of human mesenchymal stem cells derived from amniotic fluid: Comparison to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT					4th Annual Meeting of the International-Society-for-Stem-Cell-Research	JUN 29-JUL 01, 2006	Toronto, CANADA	Int Soc Stem Cell Res				Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) constitute a population of multipotent adherent cells able to give rise to multiple mesenchymal lineages such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, or chondrocytes. So far, the most common source of MSCs has been the bone marrow (BM); however BM-MSC harvesting and processing exhibits major drawbacks and limitations. Thus, identification and characterization of alternative sources of MSCs are of great importance. In the present study, we isolated and expanded fetal MSCs from second-trimester amniotic fluid (AF). We documented that these cells are of embryonic origin, can differentiate under appropriate conditions into cell types derived from all three germ layers, and express the pluripotency marker Oct-4, the human Nanog protein, and the stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4). Furthermore, we systematically tested the immunophenotype of cultured MSCs by flow cytometry analysis using a wide variety of markers. Direct comparison of this phenotype to the one derived from cultured BM-MSCs demonstrated that cultured MSCs from both sources exhibit similar expression patterns. Using the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) approach, we have generated for the first time the protein map of cultured AFMSCs by identifying 261 proteins, and we compared it directly to that of cultured BM-MSCs. The functional pattern of the identified proteins from both sources was similar. However, cultured AFMSCs displayed a number of unique proteins related to proliferation and primitive phenotype, which may confer to the distinct features of the two types. Considering the easy access to this new cell source and the yield of expanded MSCs for stem cell research, AF may provide an excellent source of MSCs both for basic research and for potential therapeutic applications.

Considering the crucial role of DCs in controlling the immune response within PLs, the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and the colocalization of MSCs and DCs in situ, we wondered whether MSCs from PLs modulate the development and functions of DCs. Using a model of monocyte-derived DCs, we showed that PL-MSCs inhibited differentiation of DCs via soluble factors, of which IL-6 had a minor effect, but did not impair their subsequent maturation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, upon maturation such DCs favored the production of Th2/Th17 cytokines by allogenic CD4(+) lymphocytes in coculture, compared with mature DCs differentiated without PL-MSCs. PL-MSC-differentiated DCs, cultivated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and PL-MSCs, although phenotypically mature, exhibited poor allostimulatory activity, induced anergy, Th2 polarization, differentiation of suppressive CD4(+)CD25(high)CD39(+) Treg-cell subsets via IDO-1-, ILT-3-, and ILT-4-dependent mechanisms, and increased production of TGF- in the coculture. In contrast, DCs cultivated with PL-MSCs only during maturation stimulated proliferation and Th1 polarization of CD4(+) T cells in an IL-12-independent manner. In conclusion, PL-MSCs significantly modulate the development and functions of DCs, depending on the phase of DCs development during which the interaction occurs.

To ensure that treatment is effective, an adequate MSC dosage should be determined before these cells are used for therapeutic purposes. To obtain a sufficient number of cells for therapeutic applications, MSCs must be expanded in long-term cell culture, which inevitably triggers cellular senescence. In this study, we investigated the surface markers of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) associated with cellular senescence using fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and 242 cell surface-marker antibodies. Among these surface proteins, we selected the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146) for further study with the aim of validating observed expression differences and investigating the associated implications in hUCB-MSCs during cellular senescence. We observed that CD146 expression markedly decreased in hUCB-MSCs following prolonged in vitro expansion. Using preparative sorting, we found that hUCB-MSCs with high CD146 expression displayed high growth rates, multilineage differentiation, expression of sternness markers, and telomerase activity, as well as significantly lower expression of the senescence markers p16, p21, p53, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, compared with that observed in hUCB-MSCs with low-level CD146 expression. In contrast, CD146 downregulation with small interfering RNAs enhanced the senescence phenotype. In addition, CD146 suppression in hUCB-MSCs caused downregulation of other cellular senescence regulators, including Bmi-1, Id1, and Twist1. Collectively, our results suggest that CD146 regulates cellular senescence; thus, it could be used as a therapeutic marker to identify senescent hUCB-MSCs.																	2157-6564	2157-6580				APR	2016	5	4					427	439		10.5966/sctm.2015-0109							WOS:000373523700004	26941359

However, precisely what types of MSCs support human HSCs in the BM remain to be elucidated because of their heterogeneity. In this study, we succeeded in prospectively isolating/establishing three types of MSCs from human BM-derived lineage- and CD45-negative cells, according to their cell surface expression of CD271 and stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4. Among them, the MSCs established from the Lineage(-)CD45(-)CD271(+)SSEA-4(+) fraction (DP MSC) could differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but they lacked adipogenic differentiation potential. The DP MSCs expressed significantly higher levels of well-characterized HSC-supportive genes, including IGF-2, Wnt3a, Jagged1, TGF beta 3, nestin, CXCL12, and Foxc1, compared with other MSCs. Interestingly, these osteo-chondrogenic DP MSCs possessed the ability to support cord blood-derived primitive human CD34-negative severe combined immunodeficiency-repopulating cells. The HSC-supportive actions of DP MSCs were partially carried out by soluble factors, including IGF-2, Wnt3a, and Jagged1. Moreover, contact between DP MSCs and CD34-positive (CD34(+)) as well as CD34-negative (CD34(-)) HSCs was important for the support/maintenance of the CD34(+/-) HSCs in vitro. These data suggest that DP MSCs might play an important role in the maintenance of human primitive HSCs in the BM niche. Therefore, the establishment of DP MSCs provides a new tool for the elucidation of the human HSC/niche interaction in vitro as well as in vivo.

Three subpopulations with intrinsic characteristics can be distinguished: small rapidly self-renewing cells, spindle-shaped cells and large, flattened cells. Unfortunately, it has neither been possible to morphologically define these distinct cells consistently, nor to relate them to specific surface marker features. Here, the primary hMSC subpopulations of three donors are clearly defined by maximum cell diameter and area. Furthermore, these cells were stained for the putative hMSC surface markers CD105, CD90 as well as CD73, and evaluated by three-colour flow cytometry and simultaneous multicolour immunocytochemistry. Interestingly, cell cultures with a high rate of triple-positive hMSC featured a higher content of rapidly self-renewing cells. On the other hand, a higher fraction of flattened cells correlated with a loss of one or more hMSC surface markers. The expression of CD73 showed the highest heterogeneity. Immunocytochemistry further confirmed that flattened cells mainly lack CD73 expression, whereas rapidly self-renewing cells were steadily positive for all three hMSC markers. In the literature, hMSC properties are especially conceded to rapidly self-renewing cells, whereas flattened cells have been suggested to represent early stages of lineage-specific progenitors. We reveal that among the recently suggested surface markers, CD73 is the most sensitive, as it seems to be down-regulated in the early stages of differentiation. Our morphological and immunocytochemical characterization of hMSC subpopulations indicates the yield of early multipotent hMSC and thereby provides a quality control approach for hMSC culturing.

Here, we describe the effects of MSCs on immune cells and their application in animal models as well as in clinical trials of autoimmune diseases. It should be pointed out that, while the number of clinical applications is increasing steadily, results should be interpreted with caution, in order to avoid rising false expectations. Major issues conditioning clinical application are the heterogeneity of MSCs and their unpredictable behavior following therapeutic administration. However, increasing knowledge on the interaction between exogenous cell and host tissue, as well as some encouraging clinical observations suggest that the therapeutic applications of MSCs will be further expanded on firmer grounds in the near future.

Molecular profile of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) revealed 4 subtypes, 2 of which, proneural and mesenchymal, have been predominantly observed, with the latter displaying a more aggressive phenotype and increased therapeutic resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that multiple subtypes actually reside within the same tumor, suggesting cellular heterogeneity in GBM. Further, plasticity between these 2 subtypes is observed during tumor recurrence and in response to radiation therapy. Methods. Patient-derived GBM stemlike cells were cultured as neurospheres. These cells were differentiated in serum by attaching to the culture dishes. The "floating" cells that were not attached/differentiated were harvested from the conditioned medium. The characteristics of these cells were studied with limiting dilution assays and immunofluorescence staining. Cell growth and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkB) activation were monitored using bio-luminescent assays as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In vivo tumorigenesis was evaluated in orthotopic xenograft models using bioluminescence imaging. Results. Patient-derived GBM stemlike cells undergo differentiation by attaching to the culture dish in serum-containing medium. We observed that a small subset of these cells escape this adhesion/differentiation and grow as floating cells. These cells displayed enhanced cancer stem cell properties with a molecular and phenotypic mesenchymal signature, including resistance to radiation and targeted therapies, a more aggressive tumor formation, and NFkB activation. Conclusion. Our results endorse inherent intratumor molecular subtype heterogeneity in glioblastoma and provide a valuable approach to study phenotypic plasticity, which could be applied to find novel therapeutic strategies to eradicate this aggressive tumor and can be extended to other cancer types.				badr, christian/AAX-1192-2020; Kantar, Rami/J-6376-2019; Wakimoto, Hiroaki/H-4533-2019; Nakano, Ichiro/AAR-9562-2020; Teng, Jian/L-3585-2019; Kantar, Rami/J-7366-2019	Wakimoto, Hiroaki/0000-0001-8225-241X; Nakano, Ichiro/0000-0002-0916-3207; Kantar, Rami/0000-0002-2245-2054												1522-8517	1523-5866				JUN	2017	19	6					820	832		10.1093/neuonc/now253							WOS:000402259500009	28062830

However, to harness their full potential, current limitations in harvesting, expansion and characterization have to be overcome. These limitations are related to the heterogeneity of MSCs in general as well as to inconsistent experimental protocols. Here we aim to compare in vitro methods to facilitate comparison of MSCs generated from various tissues. Methods: MSCs from 3 different tissues (bone marrow, dental pulp, adipose tissue), exemplified by cells from 3 randomly chosen donors per tissue, were systematically compared with respect to their in vitro properties after propagation in specific in-house standard media, as established in the individual laboratories, or in the same commercially available medium. Results: Large differences were documented with respect to the expression of cell surface antigens, population doubling times, basal expression levels of 5 selected genes and osteogenic differentiation. The commercial medium reduced differences in these parameters with respect to individual human donors within tissue and between tissues. The extent, size and tetraspanin composition of extracellular vesicles were also affected. Conclusions: The results clearly demonstrate the extreme heterogeneity of MSCs, which confirms the problem of reproducibility of results, even when harmonizing experimental conditions, and questions the significance of common parameters for MSCs from different tissues in vitro.

Complete teeth can form when culturing and implanting re-associations between single embryonic dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Although epithelial histogenesis is clear, very little is known about cell diversity and patterning in the mesenchyme.The aim of this work was to compare the situation in engineered and developing teeth at similar developmental stages. To this end, the expression of cell surface markers in the mesenchyme was investigated by immunostaining in: 1) embryonic mouse molars at embryonic day 14, as the initial cell source for re-associations, 2) cultured cell re-associations just before their implantation and 3) cultured cell re-associations implanted for two weeks. Surface markers allowed visualization of the complex patterning of different cell types and the differential timing in their appearance. The phenotype of mesenchymal cells rapidly changed when they were grown as a monolayer, even without passage. This might explain the rapid loss of their potential to sustain tooth formation after re-association. Except for markers associated with vascularization, which is not maintained in vitro, the staining pattern in the mesenchyme of cultured re-associations was similar to that observed in situ. After implantation, vascularization and the cellular heterogeneity in the mesenchyme were similar to what was observed in developing molars. Besides tissue oxygenation and its role in mineralization of dental matrices, vascularization is involved in the progressive increase in mesenchymal cell heterogeneity, by allowing external cells to enter the mesenchyme.

Linju			Multilineage differentiation and characterization of the human fetal osteoblastic 1.19 cell line: A possible in vitro model of human mesenchymal progenitors	STEM CELLS												The in vitro study of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) has largely depended on the use of primary cultures. Although these are excellent model systems, their scarcity, heterogeneity, and limited lifespan restrict their usefulness. This has led researchers to look for other sources of MSCs, and recently, such a population of progenitor/stem cells has been found in mesodermal tissues, including bone. We therefore hypothesized that a well-studied and commercially available clonal human osteoprogenitor cell line, the fetal osteoblastic 1.19 cell line (hFOB), may have multilineage differentiation potential. We found that undifferentiated hFOB cells possess similar cell surface markers as BMMSCs and also express the embryonic stem cell-related pluripotency gene, Oct-4, as well as the neural progenitor marker nestin. hFOB cells can also undergo multilineage differentiation into the mesodermal lineages of chondrogenic and adipocytic cell types in addition to its predetermined pathway, the mature osteoblast. Moreover, as with BMMSCs, under neural-inducing conditions, hFOB cells acquire a neural-like phenotype. This human cell line has been a widelyused model of normal osteoblast differentiation. Our data suggest that hFOB cells may provide for researchers an easily available, homogeneous, and consistent in vitro model for study of human mesenchymal progenitor cells.				Yen, B.

Changes in phenotype and differentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells aging in vitro	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background: Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise for regenerative medicine because of their self-renewal, multipotency, and trophic and immunosuppressive effects. Due to the rareness and high heterogeneity of freshly isolated MSCs, extensive in-vitro passage is required to expand their populations prior to clinical use; however, senescence usually accompanies and can potentially affect MSC characteristics and functionality. Therefore, a thorough characterization of the variations in phenotype and differentiation potential of in-vitro aging MSCs must be sought. Methods: Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were passaged in vitro and cultivated with either DMEM-based or alpha MEM-based expansion media. Cells were prepared for subculture every 10 days up to passage 8 and were analyzed for cell morphology, proliferative capacity, and surface marker expression at the end of each passage. The gene expression profile and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capability of MSCs at early (passage 4) and late (passage 8) passages were also evaluated. Results: In-vitro aging MSCs gradually lost the typical fibroblast-like spindle shape, leading to elevated morphological abnormality and inhomogeneity. While the DMEM-based expansion medium better facilitated MSC proliferation in the early passages, the cell population doubling rate reduced over time in both DMEM and alpha MEM groups. CD146 expression decreased with increasing passage number only when MSCs were cultured under the DMEM-based condition. Senescence also resulted in MSCs with genetic instability, which was further regulated by the medium recipe. Regardless of the expansion condition, MSCs at both passages 4 and 8 could differentiate into adipocyte-like cells whereas osteogenesis of aged MSCs was significantly compromised. For osteogenic induction, use of the aMEM-based expansion medium yielded longer osteogenesis and better quality. Conclusions: Human MSCs subjected to extensive in-vitro passage can undergo morphological, phenotypic, and genetic changes. These properties are also modulated by the medium composition employed to expand the cell populations. In addition, adipogenic potential may be better preserved over osteogenesis in aged MSCs, suggesting that MSCs at early passages must be used for osteogenic differentiation. The current study presents valuable information for future basic science research and clinical applications leading to the development of novel MSC-based therapeutic strategies for different diseases.

The clinical translation of hMSC therapy requires robust and scalable expansion technology for the biomanufacturing of therapeutically competent cells. By nature, hMSCs are highly sensitive and responsive to the microenvironments and their therapeutic potency is significantly influenced by the culture conditions during expansion. Here, we discuss the emerging roles of microenvironments in regulating hMSC fate and the implication of regulating hMSC microenvironment to achieve scalable hMSC expansion in bioreactors.

The donor variation in growth, differentiation and in vivo bone forming ability of hMSCs is a bottleneck for standardization of therapeutic protocols. In this study, we isolated and characterized hMSCs from 19 independent donors, aged between 27 and 85 years, and investigated the extent of heterogeneity of the cells and the extent to which hMSCs can be expanded without loosing multipotency. Dexamethasone-induced ALP expression varied between 1.2- and 3.7-fold, but no correlation was found with age, gender, or source of isolation. The cells from donors with a higher percentage of ALP-positive cells in control and dexamethasone-induced groups showed more calcium deposition than cells with lower percentage of ALP positive cells. Despite the variability in osteogenic gene expression among the donors tested, ALP, Collagen type 1, osteocalcin, and S100A4 showed similar trends during the course of osteogenic differentiation. In vitro expansion studies showed that hMSCs can be effectively expanded up to four passages (approximately 10-12 population doublings from a PO culture) while retaining their multipotency. Our in vivo studies suggest a correlation between in vitro ALP expression and in vivo bone formation. In conclusion, irrespective of age, gender, and source of isolation, cells from all donors showed osteogenic potential. The variability in ALP expression appears to be a result of sampling method and cellular heterogeneity among the donor population. (C) 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

As a solution, priming MSCs sensitive to signaling, thus stimulating differentiation into a specific cell lineage, may improve the differentiation yield. To demonstrate this, priming MSCs were produced by using a gelatin matrix for the isolation of primary MSCs from bone-marrow-derived primary cells. Subsequently, cellular characteristics and sensitivity to specific differentiation signals were analyzed at passage five. Compared to non-priming MSCs, priming MSCs showed no significant differences in cellular characteristics, but demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity to neurogenic differentiation signals. These results demonstrate that generation of priming MSCs by specific extracellular signaling increases the rate of differentiation into a cell-specific lineage.

Analysis of cardiac stem cell self-renewal dynamics in serum-free medium by single cell lineage tracking	STEM CELL RESEARCH												Cardiac colony forming unit-fibroblasts (cCFU-F) are a population of stromal cells residing within the SCA1(+)/PDGFRa(+)/CD31(-) fraction of adult mouse hearts, and which have functional characteristics akin to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. We hypothesise that they participate in cardiac homeostasis and repair through their actions as lineage progenitors and paracrine signaling hubs. However, cCFU-F are rare and there are no specific markers for these cells, making them challenging to study. cCFU can self-renew in vitro, although the common use of serum has made it difficult to identify cytokines that maintain lineage identity and self-renewal ability. Cell heterogeneity is an additional confounder as cCFU-F cultures are metastable. Here, we address these limitations by identifying serum-free medium (SFM) for growth, and by using cCFU-F isolated from Pdgfra(GFP/+) mice to record fate outcomes, morphology and PDGFR alpha expression for hundreds of single cells over time. We show that SFM supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor, enhanced cCFU-F colony formation and long-term self-renewal, while maintaining cCFU-F potency. cCFU-F cultured in SFM maintained a higher proportion of PDGFR alpha(+) cells, a marker of self-renewing cCFU-F, by increasing Pdgfra(GFP+) divisions and reducing the probability of spontaneous myofibroblast differentiation.

Processus and recessus adhaerentes: giant adherens cell junction systems connect and attract human mesenchymal stem cells	CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH												Substrate-adherent cultured cells derived from human bone marrow or umbilical cord blood ("mesenchymal stem cells") are of special interest for regenerative medicine. We report that such cells, which can display considerable heterogeneity with respect to their cytoskeletal protein complement, are often interconnected by special tentacle-like cell processes contacting one or several other cells. These processus adhaerentes, studded with many (usually small) puncta adhaerentia and varying greatly in length (up to more than 400 mu m long), either contact each other in the intercellular space ("ET touches") or insert in a tight-fitting manner into deep plasma membrane invaginations (recessus adhaerentes), thus forming a novel kind of long (up to 50 mu m) continuous cuff-like junction (manubria adhaerentia). The cell processes contain an actin microfilament core that is stabilized with ezrin, alpha-actinin, and myosin and accompanied by microtubules, and their adhering junctions are characterized by a molecular complement comprising the transmembrane glycoproteins N-cadherin and cadherin-11, in combination with the cytoplasmic plaque proteins alpha- and beta-catenin, together with p120(ctn), plakoglobin, and afadin. The processes are also highly dynamic and rapidly foreshorten as cell colonies approach a denser state of cell packing. These structures are obviously able to establish cell-cell connections, even over long distances, and can form deep-rooted and tight cell-cell adhesions. The possible relationship to similar cell processes in the embryonic primary mesenchyme and their potential in cell sorting and tissue formation processes in the body are discussed.

Unraveling mechanisms of mesenchymal stromal cell-mediated immunomodulation through patient monitoring and product characterization	HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS IX	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences				9th Hematopoietic Stem Cells Conference	APR, 2015	Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, GERMANY		Univ Tubingen			Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are increasingly used in the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and to modulate immune responses in conditions related to auto-/alloimmunity, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Although pilot data are promising, treatment responses have been highly variable, and further development of this as a therapeutic modality depends on increased insight into the properties of clinical MSC products and on understanding the mechanisms underlying responses in patients. Here we review the mechanisms that possibly underlie the capacity of MSCs to treat auto-/alloimmunity, and describe how patient monitoring can help to identify the in vivo mechanisms of action in the treatment of GvHD. Since MSCs used in the clinic originate from various donors and from a heterogeneous population of cells, we will also discuss recent insights into MSC heterogeneity and their implications for clinical MSC products. Finally, we describe a framework to improve our understanding of the efficacy and working mechanism of MSCs, which involves patient monitoring and more extensive characterization of the heterogeneity within and between different MSC preparations.

We analyzed the effects of MSCs isolated from human adipose tissue (AT-MSCs), dental pulp (DP-MSCs), peripheral blood (PB-MSCs) and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (UC-MSCs), on the proliferation of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While only AT-MSCs functioned as alloantigen presenting cells, proliferation of PBMCs in response to a phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and alloantigens in mixed lymphocytes reaction (MLR) was inhibited by all MSCs in a cell concentration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium (CM) derived from DP-MSCs, PB-MSCs and UC-MSCs, suppressed the baseline, PHA- and alloantigens-mediated proliferation of PBMC, whereas AT-MSCs-derived CM inhibited MLR, but failed to suppress the spontaneous and PHA-induced PBMCs proliferation. Differences between MSC types were observed in expression of genes related to immunomodulation, including human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A, HLA-DR, HLA-G5, interleukin 6 (IL)-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), under basal conditions, as well as in response to proinflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-alpha. While AT-MSCs showed a positive constitutive expression of almost all tested genes that was augmented in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, only combined cytokine treatment increased HLA-A, COX2 and IL-6 mRNA expression in DP-MSCs and slightly stimulated the expression of HLA-G and TGF-beta in UC-MSCs. Although MSCs from different tissues showed similar potential to suppress proliferation of PBMCs, heterogeneity in the expression of genes related to immunomodulation emphasizes the importance of investigating the role of specific molecular mechanisms in the regulation of immunomodulatory activity of MSCs.

J	Dzobo, K				Dzobo, Kevin			Recent Trends in Multipotent Human Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Learning from History and Advancing Clinical Applications	OMICS-A JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY												Early cell biology reports demonstrated the presence of cells with stem-like properties in bone marrow, with both hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages. Over the years, various investigations have purified and characterized mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) from different human tissues as cells with multilineage differentiation potential under the appropriate conditions. Due to their appealing characteristics and versatile potentials, MSCs are leveraged in many applications in medicine such as oncology, bioprinting, and as recent as therapeutics discovery and innovation for COVID-19. To date, studies indicate that MSCs have varied differentiation capabilities into different cell types, and demonstrate immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties. Different microenvironments or niche for MSCs and their resulting heterogeneity may influence attendant cellular behavior and differentiation capacity. The potential clinical applications of MSCs and exosomes derived from these cells have led to an avalanche of research reports on their properties and hundreds of clinical trials being undertaken. There is ample reason to think, as discussed in this expert review that the future looks bright and promising for MSC research, with many clinical trials under way to ascertain their clinical utility. This review provides a synthesis of the latest advances and trends in MSC research to allow for broad and critically informed use of MSCs. Early observations of the presence of these cells in the bone marrow and their remarkable differentiation capabilities and immunomodulation are also presented.

Variations in chondrogenesis of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in fibrin/alginate blended hydrogels	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												Fibrin and alginate hydrogels have been widely used to support chondrogenesis of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) for articular cartilage and fibrocartilage tissue engineering, with each material offering distinct advantages and disadvantages. Attempting to produce a gel scaffold exhibiting beneficial characteristics of both materials, we fabricated fibrin/alginate blended hydrogels at various blend ratios and evaluated the gel morphology, mechanical properties and their support for BM-MSC chondrogenesis. Results show that when the fibrin/alginate ratio decreased, the fibrin architecture transitioned from uniform to interconnected fibrous and finally to disconnected islands against an alginate background, with opposing trends in the alginate architecture. Fibrin maintained gel extensibility and promoted cell proliferation, while alginate improved the gel biostability and better supported glycosaminoglycan and collagen II production and chondrogenic gene expression. Blended gels had physical and biological characteristics intermediate between fibrin and alginate. Of the blends examined, FA 40:8 (40 mg ml(-1) fibrinogen blended with 8 mg ml(-1) alginate) was found to be the most appropriate group for future studies on tension-driven BM-MSC fibrochondrogenesis. As BM-MSC differentiation appeared to vary between fibrin and alginate regions of blended scaffolds, this study also highlighted the potential to develop spatially heterogeneous tissues through manipulating the heterogeneity of scaffold composition.

Inherent cell heterogeneity and asynchronous differentiation complicate population analysis; therefore, single-cell analysis was employed to determine how changes in cell stiffness correlate with changes in molecular biomarkers during differentiation. Design of a custom gridded tissue culture dish facilitated single-cell comparisons between cell mechanics and other differentiation biomarkers by enabling sequential measurement of cell mechanics and protein biomarker expression at the single cell level. The Young's modulus of mesenchymal stem cells was shown not only to decrease during chemically-induced osteoblast differentiation, but also to correlate more closely with the day of differentiation than did the relative expression of the traditional osteoblast differentiation markers, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin. Therefore, cell stiffness, a measurable property of individual cells, may serve as an improved indicator of single-cell osteoblast differentiation compared to traditional biological markers. Revelation of additional osteoblast differentiation indicators, such as cell stiffness, can improve identification and collection of starting cell populations, with applications to mesenchymal stem cell therapies and stem cell-based tissue engineering.

However, the mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cells differentiation to cancer-associated fibroblasts induced by tumor cells remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether osteosarcoma cells can also induce BMSCs into CAFs through cells co-culture system, and identify the probably signailing pathway that mediates differentiation of BMSCs to CAFs. The results showed that osteosarcoma cells can induce BMSCs to exhibit the typical characteristics of CAFs, with increased expression of alpha-SMA, the most reliable marker for CAFs. Morever, we also reveals that Notch signaling acts upstream of Akt signaling in HBMSCs-TAFs differentiation.																	1936-2625						2017	10	8					8479	8486									WOS:000408637500039	31966700

Heterogeneity of Human Breast Stem and Progenitor Cells as Revealed by Transcriptional Profiling	STEM CELL REPORTS												During development, the mammary gland undergoes extensive remodeling driven by stem cells. Breast cancers are also hierarchically organized and driven by cancer stem cells characterized by CD44(+)CD24(low/-) or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression. These markers identify mesenchymal and epithelial populations both capable of tumor initiation. Less is known about these populations in non-cancerous mammary glands. From RNA sequencing, ALDH(+) and ALDH(-)CD44(+)CD24(-) human mammary cells have epitheliallike and mesenchymal-like characteristics, respectively, with some co-expressing ALDH(+) and CD44(+)CD24(-) by flow cytometry. At the single-cell level, these cells have the greatest mammosphere-forming capacity and express high levels of stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated genes including ID1, SOX2, TWIST1, and ZEB2. We further identify single ALDH(+) cells with a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype that express genes associated with aggressive triple-negative breast cancers. These results highlight single-cell analyses to characterize tissue heterogeneity, even in marker-enriched populations, and identify genes and pathways that define this heterogeneity.

J	Wagner, W; Ho, AD; Zenke, M				Wagner, Wolfgang; Ho, Anthony D.; Zenke, Martin			Different Facets of Aging in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART B-REVIEWS												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have to be culture expanded to gain relevant cell numbers for therapeutic applications. However, within 2-3 months the proliferation rate of MSCs decays until they ultimately reach a senescent state. This is accompanied by enlarged morphology, reduced expression of surface markers, and decreased differentiation potential. So far it is only scarcely understood how long-term culture affects MSC preparations, and five processes seem to be involved: (1) MSCs are composed of different sub-populations, and due to different proliferation rates the heterogeneity changes in the course of in vitro expansion; (2) cells in culture acquire mutations and other stochastic cellular defects; (3) self-renewal of MSCs may be impaired under culture conditions, leading to gradual differentiation; (4) the number of cell divisions might be restricted (e. g., by loss of telomeres), and (5) replicative senescence might be associated with the aging process of the organism. There is a growing perception that long-term culture has to be taken into account-especially for clinical applications. On the other hand, the state of replicative senescence is poorly defined by the number of population doublings or even by the number of passages. Reliable molecular measures for cellular aging are urgently needed.																	1937-3368	1937-3376				AUG	2010	16	4					445	453		10.1089/ten.teb.2009.0825							WOS:000280375800008	20196648

The electrophysiological consequences of MSC implantation has not been systematically studied. Methods: We investigated the electrophysiological and arrhythmogenic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy in experimental infarction model. Rats were subjected to MI operation by LAD ligation and randomly allocated to receive intramyocardially injection PBS (MI-PBS) or 5x10(5) EGFP labeled MSCs (MI-MSCs). Electrophysiological study, histological examination, and western blotting were performed 2 weeks after cell transplantation. Results: Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) showed a significant reduced inducible ventricular tachycardias (VTs), raised ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) and prolonged ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) in MSC-treated rats compared to PBS-treated animals. MSC implantation led to markedly longer action potential duration (APD) and shorter activation time (AT) in infarcted border zone (IBZ) of left ventricular epicardium compared with PBS-treated hearts. Histological study revealed that fibrotic area and collagen deposition in infarcted region were significantly lower in MI-MSC group than in MI-PBS group. Abnormal alterations of Connexin 43 including reduction and lateralization were significantly attenuated by MSC treatment. Conclusions: This study provide strong evidence that MSC implantation ameliorates interstitial fibrosis and the remodeling of gap junction, attenuates focal heterogeneity of reporlarization and conduction and reduces vulnerability to VTs. The results suggest that MSC transplantation might emerge as a new preventive strategy against VAs besides improving cardiac performance in ischemic heart disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Clinically relevant morphological structures in breast cancer represent transcriptionally distinct tumor cell populations with varied degrees of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and CD44(+)CD24(-) stemness	ONCOTARGET												Intratumor morphological heterogeneity in breast cancer is represented by different morphological structures (tubular, alveolar, solid, trabecular, and discrete) and contributes to poor prognosis; however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, we performed 3D imaging, laser microdissection-assisted array comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression microarray analysis of different morphological structures and examined their association with the standard immunohistochemistry scorings and CD44(+)CD24(-) cancer stem cells. We found that the intratumor morphological heterogeneity is not associated with chromosomal aberrations. By contrast, morphological structures were characterized by specific gene expression profiles and signaling pathways and significantly differed in progesterone receptor and Ki-67 expression. Most importantly, we observed significant differences between structures in the number of expressed genes of the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and the association with cancer invasion pathways. Tubular (tube-shaped) and alveolar (spheroid-shaped) structures were transcriptionally similar and demonstrated co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Solid (large shapeless) structures retained epithelial features but demonstrated an increase in mesenchymal traits and collective cell migration hallmarks. Mesenchymal genes and cancer invasion pathways, as well as Ki-67 expression, were enriched in trabecular (one/two rows of tumor cells) and discrete groups (single cells and/or arrangements of 2-5 cells). Surprisingly, the number of CD44(+)CD24(-) cells was found to be the lowest in discrete groups and the highest in alveolar and solid structures. Overall, our findings indicate the association of intratumor morphological heterogeneity in breast cancer with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and CD44(+)CD24(-) stemness and the appeal of this heterogeneity as a model for the study of cancer invasion.

However, MSCs cultured in vitro exhibit functional heterogeneity. The underlying molecular mechanisms that define MSC heterogeneity remain unclear. Methods We investigated the gene expression profile via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human primary Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs) cultured in vitro from three donors. We also isolated CD142(+) and CD142(-) WJMSCs based on scRNA-seq data and compared their proliferation capacity and "wound healing" potential in vitro. Meanwhile, we analyzed publicly available adipose-derived MSC (ADMSCs) scRNA-seq data and performed transcriptome comparison between WJMSCs and ADMSCs at the single-cell level. Results GO enrichment analysis of highly variable genes (HVGs) obtained from WJMSCs revealed that these genes are significantly enriched in extracellular region with binding function, involved in developmental process, signal transduction, cell proliferation, etc. Pathway analysis showed that these HVGs are associated with functional characteristics of classic MSCs, such as inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling, integrin signaling, and angiogenesis. After regressing out the batch and cell cycle effects, these HVGs were used for dimension reduction and clustering analysis to identify candidate subpopulations. Differentially expressed gene analysis revealed the existence of several distinct subpopulations of MSCs that exhibit diverse functional characteristics related to proliferation, development, and inflammation response. In line with our data, sorted CD142(+) and CD142(-) WJMSCs showed distinct proliferation capacity as well as "wound healing" potential. Although WJMSCs and ADMSCs were derived from different tissues and were displaying different differentiation potencies, their HVGs were largely overlapped and had similar functional enrichment. Conclusion HVGs identified in MSCs are associated with classic MSC function. Regarding therapeutic potential, these genes are associated with functional characteristics, on which the MSC clinical application were theoretically based, such as development and inflammation response. Altogether, these HVGs hold the potential to be used as candidate markers for further potency association studies.																		1757-6512				APR 6	2020	11	1							149	10.1186/s13287-020-01660-4							WOS:000526739100001	32252818

Hundreds of clinical trials of stem cell products (SCPs) have shown promising therapeutic potential worldwide, including the products derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), adult stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Before starting a clinical trial, comprehensive chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) study is required to assure the safety and quality consistency of SCPs. The heterogeneity of stem cell products arises from the variability in the donor tissues, isolation of cells and differentiation processes, and appropriate testing approaches are needed to characterize and release SCPs. Here we summarize the regulatory considerations of CMC study in Investigational New Drug (IND) application of SCPs in China based on the current knowledge, and they will be updated in the future with the advance of stem cell biology and regulatory science.																	1045-1056	1095-8320				NOV	2020	68						3	8		10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.10.001							WOS:000594534700002	33097376

Patient-derived GSCs well recapitulate the heterogeneity of their parent glioma tissues, which can be classified into different subtypes. Likewise, previous works identified GSCs as two distinct subtypes, mesenchymal (MES) and proneural (PN) subtypes, and with general recognition, the MES subtype is considered a more malignant phenotype characterized by high invasion and radioresistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in the MES phenotype is necessary for glioblastoma treatment.MethodsData for bioinformatic analysis were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. An antibody was used to block cell surface glucose-regulated protein 78 (csGRP78). Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were performed to evaluate radiation damage. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to assess protein expression and distribution. Mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatic analysis was used to screen downstream molecules. Intracranial GSC-derived xenografts were established for in vivo experiments.ResultsTotal GRP78 expression was associated with MES GSC stemness, and csGRP78 was highly expressed in MES GSCs. Targeting csGRP78 suppressed the self-renewal and radioresistance of MES GSCs in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by downregulation of the STAT3, NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta pathways. Mass spectrometry revealed the potential downstream beta -site APP-cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2), which was regulated by csGRP78 via lysosomal degradation. Knockdown of BACE2 inactivated NF-kappa B and C/EBP beta and significantly suppressed the tumorigenesis and radioresistance of MES GSCs in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsCell surface GRP78 was preferentially expressed in MES GSCs and played a pivotal role in MES phenotype maintenance. Thus, blocking csGRP78 in MES GSCs with a high-specificity antibody might be a promising novel therapeutic strategy.

In this study, in vitro inflammatory priming to crude human BM-MSCs (n = 8) captured a baseline of signature responses, including enriched CD146(+) with coexpression of CD107a(High), CXCR4(High), and LepR(High), transcriptional profile, enhanced secretory capacity, and robust immunomodulatory secretome and function, including immunopotency assays (IPAs) with stimulated immune cells. These signatures were significantly more pronounced in CD146(+) (POS)-sorted subpopulation than in the CD146(-) (NEG). Mechanistically, POS BM-MSCs showed a markedly higher secretory capacity with significantly greater immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory protein production upon inflammatory priming compared with the NEG BM-MSCs. Moreover, IPAs with stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes demonstrated robust immunosuppression mediated by POS BM-MSC while inducing significant frequencies of regulatory T cells. in vivo evidence showed that POS BM-MSC treatment promoted pronounced M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization, ameliorating inflammation/fibrosis of knee synovium and fat pad, unlike treatment with NEG BM-MSCs. These data correlate the expression of CD146 with innately higher immunomodulatory and secretory capacity, and thus therapeutic potency. This high-content, reproducible evidence suggests that the CD146(+) (POS) MSC subpopulation are the mediators of the beneficial effects achieved using crude BM-MSCs, leading to translational implications for improving cell therapy and manufacturing.

Human olfactory mesenchymal stromal cells co-expressing horizontal basal and ensheathing cells proteins in culture Modulation of expression of human olfactory mesenchymal stromal receptors	BIOMEDICA												Introduction: The olfactory neuro-epithelium has an intrinsic capability of renewal during life time provided by the existence of globose and horizontal olfactory precursor cells. Additionally, mesenchymal estromal olfactory cells also support the homeostasis of the olfactory mucosa cell population. Under in vitro culture condition with Dulbecco modified eagle/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, tissue biopsies from upper turbinate generated an adherent population of cells which expressed mainly mesenchymal stromal phenotypic markers. Closer examination of these cells has also found co-occurrent expression of olfactory precursors and ensheathing cell phenotypic markers. These results were suggestive of a unique property of olfactory mesenchymal stromal cells as potentially olfactory progenitor cell. Objective: To ask whether expression of these proteins in mesenchymal stromal cells is modulated upon neuronal differentiation. Materials and methods: In the current study, we observed the phenotype of olfactory stromal cells under DMEM/F12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum in comparison to cells from spheres induced by serum-free medium plus basic-fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, commonly inducers of neural progenitors from neurogenic niches. Results: Expression of mesenchymal stromal (CD29(+), CD73(+), CD90(+), CD45(-)), horizontal basal (ICAM-1/CD54(+), p63(+), p75NGFr(+)), and ensheathing progenitor cells (NESTIN+, GFAP+) proteins was determined in the concurrent cultured population by flow cytometry methodology. Evenmore, determination of Oct 3/4, Sox-2 and Mash-1 transcription factors, as well as neurotrophins BDNF, NT3 and NT4 by RT-PCR in stromal cells was indicative of functional multicellular heterogeneity of the olfactory mucosa tissue sample. Conclusions: Down regulation of mesenchymal stromal and olfactory precursor proteins in cells from spheres induced by serum-free DMEM/F12 plus growth factors and subsequent differentiation into neurons and astroglial cells was suggestive of a serum-mediated mechanism of mesenchymal stromal protein expression in cells isolated from olfactory mucosa.

High-Resolution Microfluidic Single-Cell Transcriptional Profiling Reveals Clinically Relevant Subtypes among Human Stem Cell Populations Commonly Utilized in Cell-Based Therapies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY												Stem cell therapies can promote neural repair and regeneration, yet controversy regarding optimal cell source and mechanism of action has slowed clinical translation, potentially due to undefined cellular heterogeneity. Single-cell resolution is needed to identify clinically relevant subpopulations with the highest therapeutic relevance. We combine single-cell microfluidic analysis with advanced computational modeling to study for the first time two common sources for cell-based therapies, human NSCs and MSCs. This methodology has the potential to logically inform cell source decisions for any clinical application.

This activity has been, at least in part, ascribed to the transfer of proteins/transcription factors and different RNA species. Information on the RNA/protein content of different MSC EV subpopulations and the correlation with their biological activity is currently incomplete. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular composition and the functional properties on renal target cells of MSC EV sub-populations separated by gradient floatation. The results demonstrated heterogeneity in quantity and composition of MSC EVs. Two peaks of diameter were observed (90-110 and 170-190 nm). The distribution of exosomal markers and miRNAs evaluated in the twelve gradient fractions showed an enrichment in fractions with a flotation density of 1.08-1.14 g/mL. Based on this observation, we evaluated the biological activity on renal cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance of low (CF1), medium (CF2) and high (CF3) floatation density fractions. EVs derived from all fractions, were internalized by renal cells, CF1 and CF2 but not CF3 fraction stimulated significant cell proliferation. CF2 also inhibited apoptosis on renal tubular cells submitted to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Comparative miRNomic and proteomic profiles reveal a cluster of miRNAs and proteins common to all three fractions and an enrichment of selected molecules related to renal regeneration in CF2 fraction. In conclusion, the CF2 fraction enriched in exosomal markers was the most active on renal tubular cell proliferation and protection from apoptosis.

Methods: Using an in vitro model of carcinogenesis we aimed at experimentally elucidating the significance of heterogeneity in the expression of CD24, a marker frequently overexpressed in various cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. Results: We show that CD24(Neg) and CD24(Pos) cells issued from the same tumorigenic cell line display striking differences in stern-related properties, expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition/mesenchymal-epithelial transition markers, and tumorigenic capacity. Indeed, while CD24(N)(eg) cells were as tumorigenic as the parental cell line, CD24( )(Pos)cells, although unable to form tumors, were unexpectedly more mesenchymal, displayed enhanced sternness-related properties, and expressed a proinflammatory signature. Conclusion: Our findings support the view that acquisition of stem-like cell, CD24-associated, attributes like migration, invasion, and plasticity by a tumor subpopulation is not necessarily related to local tumor growth but may be required for escaping the niche and colonizing distant sites.

Allogeneic clonal mesenchymal stem cell therapy for refractory graft-versus-host disease to standard treatment: a phase I study	KOREAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an often lethal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The safety of clinical-grade mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been validated, but mixed results have been obtained due to heterogeneity of the MSCs. In this phase I study, the safety of bone marrow-derived homogeneous clonal MSCs (cMSCs) isolated by a new subfractionation culturing method was evaluated. cMSCs were produced in a GMP facility and intravenously administered to patients who had refractory GVHD to standard treatment resulting after allogeneic HSCT for hematologic malignancies. After administration of a single dose (1x10(6) cells/kg), 11 patients were evaluated for cMSC treatment safety and efficacy. During the trial, nine patients had 85 total adverse events and the rate of serious adverse events was 27.3% (3/11 patients). The only one adverse drug reaction related to cMSC administration was grade 2 myalgia in one patient. Treatment response was observed in four patients: one with acute GVHD (partial response) and three with chronic GVHD. The other chronic patients maintained stable disease during the observation period. This study demonstrates single cMSC infusion to have an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy, suggesting that we can proceed with the next stage of the clinical trial.																	1226-4512	2093-3827				JAN	2016	20	1					63	67		10.4196/kjpp.2016.20.1.63							WOS:000367762000008	26807024

Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single-cell RNA-seq, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage tracing, temporal single-cell analyses, and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged unilineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into microniches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.

Stem cell metabolism is at the core of cellular fate (proliferation, differentiation, death) and metabolomics provides global metabolic signatures representative of cellular status, being able to accurately identify the quality of stem cell differentiation. Herein, umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UCB MSCs) were encapsulated in novel oxidized alginate hydrogels functionalized with the glycine-histidine-lysine (GHK) peptide and differentiated towards the osteoblastic lineage. The ADA-GHK hydrogels significantly improved osteogenic differentiation compared to gelatin-containing control hydrogels, as demonstrated by gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity and bone extracellular matrix deposition. Metabolomics revealed the high degree of metabolic heterogeneity in the gelatin-containing control hydrogels, captured the enhanced osteogenic differentiation in the ADA-GHK hydrogels, confirmed the similar metabolism between differentiated cells and primary osteoblasts, and elucidated the metabolic mechanism responsible for the function of GHK. Our results suggest a novel paradigm for metabolomics-guided biomaterial design and robust stem cell bioprocessing. Statement of Significance Producing high quality engineered bone grafts is important for the treatment of critical sized bone defects. Robust and sensitive techniques are required for quality assessment of tissue-engineered constructs, which result to the selection of optimal biomaterials for bone graft development. Herein, we present a new use of metabolomics signatures in guiding the development of novel oxidised alginate-based hydrogels with umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells and the glycine-histidine-lysine peptide, demonstrating that GHK induces stem cell osteogenic differentiation. Metabolomics signatures captured the enhanced osteogenesis in GHK hydrogels, confirmed the metabolic similarity between differentiated cells and primary osteoblasts, and elucidated the metabolic mechanism responsible for the function of GHK. In conclusion, our results suggest a new paradigm of metabolomics-driven design of biomaterials. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To analyse the heterogeneity at the single-cell level of human mesenchymal progenitor cells from SM. Methods. Cell populations were enzymatically released from the knee joint synovium of adult human individuals. Single cell-derived clonal populations were obtained by limiting dilution and serially passaged to determine growth rates. Phenotypic analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Replicative senescence was assessed by the senescence-associated P-galactosidase staining. Telomere lengths were determined semiquantitatively by Southern blotting. Telomerase activity was measured using a real-time quantitative telomerase repeat amplification procedure. Culture-expanded clonal populations were subjected to in vitro differentiation assays to investigate their mesenchymal multipotency. Results. The 50 clones analysed displayed wide variations in the proliferation rates, even within the same donor sample. The time taken to reach 20 population doublings ranged from 44 to 130 days. The phenotype of the clones tested was compatible with that of mesenchymal stem cells. Mean telomere lengths ranged from 5.2 to 10.9 kb with positive linear trend with telomerase activity, but no correlation with proliferative rates or cell senescence. All clones tested were capable of chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, though with large variability in potency. In contrast, only 30% of the clones were adipogenic. Conclusions. We report for the first time the co-existence, within the synovium, of progenitor cell subsets with distinct mesenchymal differentiation potency. Our findings further emphasize the need for strategies to purify cell populations with the clinically desired tissue formation potentials.

However, molecular signaling in glioma stem cells (GSCs) in individual HGG subtypes is poorly characterized. Here we identified and characterized two mutually exclusive GSC subtypes with distinct dysregulated signaling pathways. Analysis of mRNA profiles distinguished proneural (PN) from mesenchymal (Mes) GSCs and revealed a pronounced correlation with the corresponding PN or Mes HGGs. Mes GSCs displayed more aggressive phenotypes in vitro and as intracranial xenografts in mice. Further, Mes GSCs were markedly resistant to radiation compared with PN GSCs. The glycolytic pathway, comprising aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family genes and in particular ALDH1A3, were enriched in Mes GSCs. Glycolytic activity and ALDH activity were significantly elevated in Mes GSCs but not in PN GSCs. Expression of ALDH1A3 was also increased in clinical HGG compared with low-grade glioma or normal brain tissue. Moreover, inhibition of ALDH1A3 attenuated the growth of Mes but not PN GSCs. Last, radiation treatment of PN GSCs up-regulated Mes-associated markers and down-regulated PN-associated markers, whereas inhibition of ALDH1A3 attenuated an irradiation-induced gain of Mes identity in PN GSCs. Taken together, our data suggest that two subtypes of GSCs, harboring distinct metabolic signaling pathways, represent inter-tumoral glioma heterogeneity and highlight previously unidentified roles of ALDH1A3-associated signaling that promotes aberrant proliferation of Mes HGGs and GSCs. Inhibition of ALDH1A3-mediated pathways therefore might provide a promising therapeutic approach for a subset of HGGs with the Mes signature.

Recent advances have been made in understanding their origin, heterogeneity, and the signals that induce their migration and maturation resident microglia are antigen-presenting cells (APC) involved in stimulation or reactivation of CNS-targeted T cells. Generation of DC from microglia, as demonstrated ex vivo, may support GM-CSF-driven differentiation of brain DC from local, likely, microglial progenitors. Here, we report the establishment of long-term cultures of rat ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) using specific supplemented media for induction. These EMSCs share some morphological characteristics and the allostimulatory capacity of classical DCs, and when transplanted into the brain using a rat glioma model survive within the cortex, and are morphologically and phenotypically similar to microglia over 7 days. Our findings related to the development and differentiation of microglial progenitors support the view that microglia are derived prenatally from mesodermal progenitors that are distinct from monocytes.

Survival of aging CD264(+) and CD264(-) populations of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells is independent of colony-forming efficiency	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING												In vivo mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) survival is relevant to therapeutic applications requiring engraftment and potentially to nonengraftment applications as well. MSCs are a mixture of progenitors at different stages of cellular aging, but the contribution of this heterogeneity to the survival of MSC implants is unknown. Here, we employ a biomarker of cellular aging, the decoy TRAIL receptor CD264, to compare the survival kinetics of two cell populations in human bone marrow MSC (hBM-MSC) cultures. Sorted CD264(+) hBM-MSCs from two age-matched donors have elevated beta-galactosidase activity, decreased differentiation potential and form in vitro colonies inefficiently relative to CD264(-) hBM-MSCs. Counterintuitive to their aging phenotype, CD264(+) hBM-MSCs exhibited comparable survival to matched CD264(-) hBM-MSCs from the same culture during in vitro colony formation and in vivo when implanted ectopically in immunodeficient NIH III mice. In vitro and in vivo survival of these two cell populations were independent of colony-forming efficiency. These findings have ramifications for the preparation of hBM-MSC therapies given the prevalence of aging CD264(+) cells in hBM-MSC cultures and the popularity of colony-forming efficiency as a quality control metric in preclinical and clinical studies with MSCs.

Previous reports demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can promote proliferation and cartilage differentiation potential of MSCs in vitro, although no reports show its beneficial effect in vivo. The purpose of this study is to investigate the promoting effect of bFGF on cartilage regeneration using human SMSC in vivo. SMSCs were cultured with or without bFGF in a growth medium, and 2 x 10(5) cells were aggregated to form a synovial pellet. Synovial pellets were implanted into osteochondral defects induced in the femoral trochlea of severe combined immunodeficient mice, and histological evaluation was performed after eight weeks. The presence of implanted SMSCs was confirmed by the observation of human vimentin immunostaining-positive cells. Interestingly, broad lacunae structures and cartilage substrate stained by Safranin-O were observed only in the bFGF (+) group. The bFGF (+) group had significantly higher O'Driscoll scores in the cartilage repair than the bFGF (-) group. The addition of bFGF to SMSC growth culture may be a useful treatment option to promote cartilage regeneration in vivo.

Heterogeneity of MSC cultures and considerable donor variability however, still preclude standardised production of MSC and point on functional deficits for some human MSC populations. We aimed to identify functional correlates of donor-dependency of bone formation in order to develop a potency assay predicting the therapeutic capacity of human MSC before clinical transplantation. MSC from 29 donors were characterised in vitro and results were correlated to bone formation potency in a beta-tricalcium-phosphate (beta-TCP)-scaffold after subcutaneous implantation into immunocompromised mice. In contrast to osteogenic in vitro differentiation parameters, a doubling time below 43.23 hours allowed to predict ectopic bone formation at high sensitivity (81.8%) and specificity (100%). Enriched conditions adapted from embryonic stem cell expansion rescued bone formation of inferior MSC populations while growth arrest of potent MSC by mitomycin C abolished bone formation, establishing a causal relationship between neo-bone formation and growth. Gene expression profiling confirmed a key role for proliferation status for the bone forming ability suggesting that a rate limiting anabolism and open chromatin determined and predicted the therapeutic potency of culture-expanded MSC.

Recent studies suggest a strong correlation between the SC migration potential and their therapeutic efficacy in humans. Designating SC migration as a denominator of functional SC heterogeneity, we sought to identify highly migrating subpopulations within different SC classes and evaluate their therapeutic properties in comparison to the parental non-selected cells. Methods: We selected highly migrating subpopulations from mesenchymal and neural SC (sMSC and sNSC), characterized their features including but not limited to migratory potential, trophic factor release and transcriptomic signature. To assess lesion-targeted migration and therapeutic properties of isolated subpopulations in vivo, surgical transplantation and intranasal administration of MSCs in mouse models of glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease respectively were performed. Findings: Comparison of parental non-selected cells with isolated subpopulations revealed superior motility and migratory potential of sMSC and sNSC in vitro. We identified podoplanin as a major regulator of migratory features of sMSC/sNSC. Podoplanin engineering improved oncovirolytic activity of virus-loaded NSC on distantly located glioblastoma cells. Finally, sMSC displayed more targeted migration to the tumour site in a mouse glioblastoma model and remarkably higher potency to reduce pathological hallmarks and memory deficits in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice. Interpretation: Functional heterogeneity of SC is associated with their motility and migration potential which can serve as predictors of SC therapeutic efficacy.

ADMSCs are heterogeneous cell populations with pluripotent capacity to differentiate into different types of cells. In the present study, we investigated the biological characteristics and differentiation potential of CD73-positive (CD73(+)) and CD73-negative (CD73(-)) ADMSCs. Our results show that in terms of morphological shape, CD73(+)-ADMSCs are mainly small-sized cells, whereas CD73(-)-ADMSCs are big-sized cells; both subpopulations can equally differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts in vitro. However, the CD73(+)-ADMSCs possess a higher potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes than the CD73(-)-ADMSCs. The expression of the cardiac-specific genes, cTnT, Gata4, and Nkx2.5, is much higher in the CD73(+)-ADMSCs than in the CD73(-)-ADMSCs. Furthermore, Nanog expression at both the mRNA and protein levels is significantly higher in CD73(+)-ADMSCs than in CD73(-)-ADMSCs, suggesting that CD73(+)-ADMSCs are an undifferentiated subpopulation that can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro more efficiently. Therefore, this study facilitates a better understanding of the differentiation of the ADMSCs subgroups and attempts to identify if CD73 is a useful marker for sorting and purifying the subpopulation of ADMSCs with a higher capacity for differentiation into cardiomyocytes.																	1567-2379	1567-2387				AUG	2013	44	4					411	422		10.1007/s10735-013-9492-9							WOS:000322335700005	23456425

We analyzed global proteomic profiles for osteoblasts derived from ten and MSCs from six healthy individuals, and we quantified 5465 proteins for the osteoblasts and 5420 proteins for the MSCs. There was a large overlap in the profiles for the two cell types; 156 proteins were quantified only in osteoblasts and 111 proteins only for the MSCs. The osteoblast-specific proteins included several extracellular matrix proteins and a network including 27 proteins that influence intracellular signaling (Wnt/Notch/Bone morphogenic protein pathways) and bone mineralization. The osteoblasts and MSCs showed only minor age- and sex-dependent proteomic differences. Finally, the osteoblast and MSC proteomic profiles were altered by ex vivo culture in serum-free media. We conclude that although the proteomic profiles of osteoblasts and MSCs show many similarities, we identified several osteoblast-specific extracellular matrix proteins and an osteoblast-specific intracellular signaling network. Therapeutic targeting of these proteins will possibly have minor effects on MSCs. Furthermore, the use of ex vivo cultured osteoblasts/MSCs in clinical medicine will require careful standardization of the ex vivo handling of the cells.

J	Nemeth, K				Nemeth, Krisztian			Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for immune-modulation: the donor, the recipient, and the drugs in-between	EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY												Adoptive transfer of cultured bone marrow stromal cells (mesenchymal stem cells also known as MSCs) is a promising new way to aid tissue regeneration and treat a wide variety of diseases where regulation of inflammatory responses is derailed. Although significant advances have been made in the field, pinpointing important mechanistic details about how MSCs function in vitro and in vivo, there are still many unanswered questions that need to be addressed before welcoming MSCs in the therapeutic arsenal of immune mediated diseases. In this viewpoint, we highlight and discuss a few factors that we believe are critical in terms of therapeutic success employing cultured MSCs. Selecting the right donor population, choosing the best culture conditions and picking the patient population that is most likely to give a favourable therapeutic response is just as important as considering interactions between MSCs and the combination of drugs in the recipient's body. Given the complexity of MSC-host interactions, it is also imperative to develop screening tools that account for as many variables as possible and predict precisely the in vivo response rates before MSCs enter the body. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary approach is required with comprehensive knowledge of basic MSC biology, immunology, pharmacology and good clinical practice.

Investigating the interplay between substrate stiffness and ligand chemistry in directing mesenchymal stem cell differentiation within 3D macro-porous substrates	BIOMATERIALS												Dimensionality can have a profound impact on stiffness-mediated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, while we have begun to understand cellular response when encapsulated within 3D substrates, the behavior of cells within macro-porous substrates is relatively underexplored. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of macro-porous topographies on stiffness-mediated differentiation of MSCs. We developed macro-porous recombinant elastin-like protein (ELP) substrates that allow independent control of mechanical properties and ligand chemistry. We then used computational modeling to probe the impact of pore topography on the mechanical stimulus that cells are exposed to within these substrates, and finally we investigated stiffness induced biases towards adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs within macro-porous substrates. Computational modeling revealed that there is significant heterogeneity in the mechanical stimuli that cells are exposed to within porous substrates and that this heterogeneity is predominantly due to the wide range of possible cellular orientations within the pores. Surprisingly, MSCs grown within 3D porous substrates respond to increasing substrate stiffness by up-regulating both osteogenesis and adipogenesis. These results demonstrate that within porous substrates the behavior of MSCs diverges from previously observed responses to substrate stiffness, emphasizing the importance of topography as a determinant of cellular behavior.

Although several cell surface antigens have been identified in CCSCs, these markers vary among tumors because of CSC heterogeneity. However, whether these markers specifically distinguish CCSCs with different functions is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CCSCs exist in two biologically distinct phenotypes characterized by different levels of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2 alpha) expression. Overexpression of cPLA2 alpha results in a CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype associated with mesenchymal traits, including increased invasive and migration abilities, whereas CCSCs with cPLA2 alpha downregulation express CD133 and show quiescent epithelial characteristics. In addition, cPLA2 alpha regulates the reversible transition between mesenchymal and epithelial CCSC states through PKC zeta, an atypical protein kinase C, which governs cancer cell state changes and the maintenance of various embryonic stem cell characteristics, further inhibiting beta-catenin-E-cadherin interaction in membrane and promoting beta-catenin translocation into the nucleus to affect the transcriptional regulation of stemness signals. We propose that reversible transitions between mesenchymal and epithelial CCSC states regulated by cPLA2 alpha are necessary for cervical cancer metastasis and recurrence. Thus, cPLA2 alpha might be an attractive therapeutic target for eradicating different states of CCSCs to eliminate tumors more effectively.																	1066-5099	1549-4918				APR	2020	38	4					487	503		10.1002/stem.3157		FEB 2020					WOS:000516020900001	32100928

Toward an ideal animal model to trace donor cell fates after stem cell therapy: Production of stably labeled multipotent mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow of transgenic pigs harboring enhanced green fluorescence protein gene	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The discovery of postnatal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with their general multipotentiality has fueled much interest in the development of cell-based therapies. Proper identification of transplanted MSC is crucial for evaluating donor cell distribution, differentiation, and migration. Lack of an efficient marker of transplanted MSC has precluded our understanding of MSC-related regenerative studies, especially in large animal models such as pigs. In the present study, we produced transgenic pigs harboring an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene. The pigs provide a reliable and reproducible source for obtaining stable EGFP-labeled MSC, which is very useful for donor cell tracking after transplantation. The undifferentiated EGFP-tagged MSC expressed a greater quantity of EGFP while maintaining MSC multipotentiality. These cells exhibited homogeneous surface epitopes and possessed classic trilineage differentiation potential into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages, with robust EGFP expression maintained in all differentiated progeny. Injection of donor MSC can dramatically increase the thickness of infarcted myocardium and improve cardiac function in mice. Moreover, the MSC, with their strong EGFP expression, can be easily distinguished from the background autofluorescence in myocardial infarcts. We demonstrated an efficient, effective, and easy way to identify MSC after long-term culture and transplantation. With the transgenic model, we were able to obtain stem or progenitor cells in earlier passages compared with the transfection of traceable markers into established MSC. Because the integration site of the transgene was the same for all cells, we lessened the potential for positional effects and the heterogeneity of the stem cells. The EGFP-transgenic pigs may serve as useful biomedical and agricultural models of somatic stem cell biology.

We previously identified the multifunctional p57kip2 protein as a negative regulator of myelinating glial cell differentiation and as an intrinsic switch of glial fate decision in adult neural stem cells (aNSCs). In oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs), p57kip2 protein nuclear exclusion was recently found to be rate limiting for differentiation to proceed. Furthermore, stimulation with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived factors enhanced oligodendrogenesis by yet unknown mechanisms. To elucidate this instructive interaction, we investigated to what degree MSC secreted factors are species dependent, whether hippocampal aNSCs respond equally well to such stimuli, whether apart from oligodendroglial differentiation also tissue integration and axonal wrapping can be promoted and whether the oligodendrogenic effect involved subcellular translocation of p57kip2. We found that CC1 positive oligodendrocytes within the hilus express nuclear p57kip2 protein and that MSC dependent stimulation of cultured hippocampal aNSCs was not accompanied by nuclear p57kip2 exclusion as observed for parenchymal OPCs after spontaneous differentiation. Stimulation with human MSC factors was observed to equally promote rat stem cell oligodendrogenesis, axonal wrapping and tissue integration. As forced nuclear shuttling of p57kip2 led to decreased CNPase- but elevated GFAP expression levels, this indicates heterogenic oligodendroglial mechanisms occurring between OPCs and aNSCs. We also show for the first time that dominant pro-oligodendroglial factors derived from human fetal MSCs can instruct human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs to differentiate into O4 positive oligodendrocytes.

The use of MSCs on bone regeneration has been assessed in several studies, obtaining promising results. However, the endless combinations that can be tested and the heterogeneity in the experimental conditions become a drawback when comparing results between authors. Moreover, it is very hard to find autologous studies using adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSC) in rodents, which is the most used preclinical animal model. In this article an experimental model for basic bone tissue engineering research is described and justified, on which adult AD-MSCs are safely isolated from the rat dorsal interscapular fat pad, allowing ex vivo expansion and autogenous orthotopic reimplantation in a bilateral mandibular bone defect made in the same animal. This reliable and reproducible model provides a simple way to perform basic experimentation studies in a small animal model using autologous MSC for bone regeneration or cell therapy techniques prior to improve the research on large animal models. Predictable and safe harvest of adipose-derived MSC. No need of animal sacrifice. Allows for autologous studies with the most frequently used animal model: the rat. No need of allogeneic or human MSC use and, therefore, immunological concerns are avoided. Bilateral mandibular critical size defect to allow direct control/experimental comparison.

J	Dufrane, D				Dufrane, Denis			Impact of Age on Human Adipose Stem Cells for Bone Tissue Engineering	CELL TRANSPLANTATION												Bone nonunion is a pathological condition in which all bone healing processes have stopped, resulting in abnormal mobility between 2 bone segments. The incidence of bone-related injuries will increase in an aging population, leading to such injuries reaching epidemic proportions. Tissue engineering and cell therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have raised the possibility of implanting living tissue for bone reconstruction. Bone marrow was first proposed as the source of stem cells for bone regeneration. However, as the quantity of MSCs in the bone marrow decreases, the capacity of osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells is also impaired by the donor's age in terms of reduced MSC replicative capacity; an increased number of apoptotic cells; formation of colonies positive for alkaline phosphatase; and decreases in the availability, growth potential, and temporal mobilization of MSCs for bone formation in case of fracture. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) demonstrate several advantages over those from bone marrow, including a less invasive harvesting procedure, a higher number of stem cell progenitors from an equivalent amount of tissue harvested, increased proliferation and differentiation capacities, and better angiogenic and osteogenic properties in vivo. Subcutaneous native adipose tissue was not affected by the donor's age in terms of cellular senescence and yield of ASC isolation. In addition, a constant mRNA level of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase with a similar level of matrix mineralization of ASCs remained unaffected by donor age after osteogenic differentiation. The secretome of ASCs was also unaffected by age when aiming to promote angiogenesis by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release in hypoxic conditions. Therefore, the use of adipose cells for bone tissue engineering is not limited by the donor's age from the isolation of stem cells up to the manufacturing of a complex osteogenic graft.																	0963-6897	1555-3892				SEP	2017	26	9			SI		1496	1504		10.1177/0963689717721203							WOS:000414907000002	29113460					
J	Tripathi, S; Chakraborty, P; Levine, H; Jolly, MK				Tripathi, Shubham; Chakraborty, Priyanka; Levine, Herbert; Jolly, Mohit Kumar			A mechanism for epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												Epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity implies that cells within the same tumor can exhibit different phenotypes-epithelial, mesenchymal, or one or more hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes. This behavior has been reported across cancer types, both in vitro and in vivo, and implicated in multiple processes associated with metastatic aggressiveness including immune evasion, collective dissemination of tumor cells, and emergence of cancer cell subpopulations with stem cell-like properties. However, the ability of a population of cancer cells to generate, maintain, and propagate this heterogeneity has remained a mystifying feature. Here, we used a computational modeling approach to show that epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity can emerge from the noise in the partitioning of biomolecules (such as RNAs and proteins) among daughter cells during the division of a cancer cell. Our model captures the experimentally observed temporal changes in the fractions of different phenotypes in a population of murine prostate cancer cells, and describes the hysteresis in the population-level dynamics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. The model is further able to predict how factors known to promote a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype can alter the phenotypic composition of a population. Finally, we used the model to probe the implications of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity for different therapeutic regimens and found that co-targeting of epithelial and mesenchymal cells is likely to be the most effective strategy for restricting tumor growth. By connecting the dynamics of an intracellular circuit to the phenotypic composition of a population, our study serves as a first step towards understanding the generation and maintenance of non-genetic heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells, and towards the therapeutic targeting of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer cell populations.

However, incongruent data has been reported partially owing to their functional heterogeneity. To provide sufficient and suitable clinical seed cells derived from the placenta for MSC therapy, we compared the various current isolation methods, as well as the biological characteristics, of different human placenta mesenchymal stem cells (hPMSCs).MethodsWe selected placentas from 35 informed donors and exploited three commonly used methods. MSCs were isolated from different parts of placental tissue including umbilical cord (UC), amniotic membrane (AM), chorionic membrane (CM), chorionic villi (CV), and deciduae (DC). The appropriate isolation methods for each type of hPMSCs were first assessed. The resulting five MSC types from the same individuals were identified based on their surface marker expression, proliferation capacity, transcriptome, differentiation, multipotency and karyotype.ResultsAll three methods successfully isolated the five hPMSC types from placental tissues. However, the UC-MSCs were most effectively separated via the tissue explant method, while the enzymatic digestion method was found to be more suitable for separating CV-MSCs, owing to its higher output efficiency compared to the other methods. Alternatively, the perfusion method was complicated and exhibited the lowest efficiency for cell isolation and uniformity. Furthermore, we determined that UC-MSCs and CV-MSCs express a higher level of paracrine cytokines and display much stronger proliferative capacity as well as superior extraction efficiency. Finally, karyotype analysis revealed that DC-MSCs are derived from the mother, while the other cell types are derived from the fetus. Moreover, the different hPMSCs exhibited unique gene expression profiles, which may prove advantageous in treatment of a broad range of diseases.ConclusionshPMSCs from different sources are similar yet also unique. Our results describe the biological characteristics of five hPMSCs and provide insights to aide in the selection process of candidates for MSCs treatment. Overall, UC- and CV-MSCs appear to be ideal sources of primary MSCs for clinical treatment and future research.

Mesenchymal differentiation propensity of a human embryonic stem cell line	CELL PROLIFERATION												Objectives: To characterize basal differentiation tendencies of a human embryonic stem (hES) cell line, KCL-002. Materials and methods: In vitro specification and differentiation of hES cells were carried out using embryoid body (EB) cultures and tests of pluripotency and in vivo differentiation were performed by teratoma assays in SCID mice. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and histological analyses were used to identify expression of genes and proteins associated with the ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal germ layers. Results: Undifferentiated KCL-002 cells expressed characteristic markers of pluripotent stem cells such as Nanog, Sox-2, Oct-4 and TRA 1-60. When differentiated in vitro as EB cultures, expression of pluripotency, endodermal and ectodermal markers decreased rapidly. In contrast, mesodermal and mesenchymal markers such as VEGFR-2, alpha-actin and vimentin increased during EB differentiation as shown by qPCR, immunostaining and flow cytometric analyses. Teratoma formation in SCID mice demonstrated the potential to form all germ layers in vivo with a greater proportion of the tumours containing mesenchymal derivatives. Conclusions: The data presented suggest that the KCL-002 hES cell line is pluripotent and harbours a bias in basal differentiation tendencies towards mesodermal and mesenchymal lineage cells. Characterizing innate differentiation propensities of hES cell lines is important for understanding heterogeneity between different cell lines and for further studies aimed at deriving specific lineages from hES cells.

The regenerative potential of stem cells is usually attributed to several allogeneic or even autologous donor-related factors. Genetic background and epigenetic variations in different individuals may significantly affect the functional heterogeneity of stem cells. Particularly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been implicated in diseases with monogenetic or multifactorial and complex genetic etiologies. However, the possible effects of individual SNPs on donor stem cells remain far from fully elucidated. In this Perspective, we will discuss the roles played by donor genetic traits in the functional heterogeneity of induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells and their implications for regenerative medicine and therapy.																	2157-6564	2157-6580				DEC	2020	9	12					1495	1499		10.1002/sctm.20-0155		AUG 2020					WOS:000561826100001	32830917

Distinct Stem Cells Subpopulations Isolated from Human Adipose Tissue Exhibit Different Chondrogenic and Osteogenic Differentiation Potential	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												Recently adipose tissue has become a research topic also for the searching for an alternative stem cells source to use in cell based therapies such as tissue engineer. In fact Adipose Stem Cells (ASCs) exhibit an important differentiation potential for several cell lineages such as chondrogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, adipogenic and endothelial cells. ASCs populations isolated using standard methodologies (i.e., based on their adherence ability) are very heterogeneous but very few studies have analysed this aspect. Consequently, several questions are still pending, as for example, on what regard the existence/ or not of distinct ASCs subpopulations. The present study is originally aimed at isolating selected ASCs subpopulations, and to analyse their behaviour towards the heterogeneous population regarding the expression of stem cell markers and also regarding their osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential. Human Adipose derived Stem Cells (hASCs) subpopulations were isolated using immunomagnetic beads coated with several different antibodies (CD29, CD44, CD49d, CD73, CD90, CD 105, Stro-1 and p75) and were characterized by Real Time RT-PCR in order to assess the expression of mesenchymal stem cells markers (CD44, CD73, Stro-1, CD105 and CD90) as well as known markers of the chondrogenic (Sox 9, Collagen II) and osteogenic lineage (Osteopontin, Osteocalcin). The obtained results underline the complexity of the ASCs population demonstrating that it is composed of several subpopulations, which express different levels of ASCs markers and exhibit distinctive differentiation potentials. Furthermore, the results obtained clearly evidence of the advantages of using selected populations in cell-based therapies, such as bone and cartilage regenerative medicine approaches.

The Wnt5a Receptor, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-Like Orphan Receptor 2, Is a Predictive Cell Surface Marker of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells with an Enhanced Capacity for Chondrogenic Differentiation	STEM CELLS												Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have enormous potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, until now, their development for clinical use has been severely limited as they are a mixed population of cells with varying capacities for lineage differentiation and tissue formation. Here, we identify receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) as a cell surface marker expressed by those MSCs with an enhanced capacity for cartilage formation. We generated clonal human MSC populations with varying capacities for chondrogenesis. ROR2 was identified through screening for upregulated genes in the most chondrogenic clones. When isolated from uncloned populations, ROR2+ve MSCs were significantly more chondrogenic than either ROR2-ve or unfractionated MSCs. In a sheep cartilage-repair model, they produced significantly more defect filling with no loss of cartilage quality compared with controls. ROR2+ve MSCs/perivascular cells were present in developing human cartilage, adult bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Their frequency in bone marrow was significantly lower in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) than in controls. However, after isolation of these cells and their initial expansion in vitro, there was greater ROR2 expression in the population derived from OA patients compared with controls. Furthermore, osteoarthritis-derived MSCs were better able to form cartilage than MSCs from control patients in a tissue engineering assay. We conclude that MSCs expressing high levels of ROR2 provide a defined population capable of predictably enhanced cartilage production.				de Godoy, Roberta Ferro/W-6221-2019	de Godoy, Roberta Ferro/0000-0003-0037-5286; Blom, Ashley/0000-0002-9940-1095; Kafienah, Wael/0000-0003-1487-6823; Hollander, Anthony/0000-0003-2897-3747												1066-5099	1549-4918				NOV	2017	35	11					2280	2291		10.1002/stem.2691							WOS:000413924300007	28833807

Oral Cancer Stem Cells Microenvironment	STEM CELL MICROENVIRONMENTS AND BEYOND	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology											Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important role in tumor growth and metastasis coupled with increased recurrences and acquired therapeutic resistance in oral cancer. The tumor microenvironment imposes intense pressure in cancer evolution in response to adverse growth conditions, resource limitation and immune predation. Here, we discussed the dynamic interplay between cancer stem cells and tumor microenvironment in the formation of intratumoral heterogeneity to modulate tumor progression. The CSCs niche provide a special microhabitat for survival, maintenance of stemness and tumor re-propagation. Moreover, adaptive cellular behavior might be driven by tough tumor microenvironmental selective forces which highly regulate alterations in the gene expression leading to the reprogramming of signaling pathways generating stem-like characteristics, adaptive metabolic plasticity and energy fueling with autophagy to permit the CSCs to sustain in the ever changing microenvironments during tumor progression. On the other hand, CSCs also direct the tumor microenvironment modulation and remodeling in its favour. The cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released from CSCs regulates neoangiogensis, differentiation, degradation of matrix protein and immune suppression favoring tumor-promoting conditions and initiates multiple signaling cascades augmenting the tumor progression.

Among different environmental associated parameters, those related to functional, cytogenetic and immunological integrity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are particularly relevant. Functional alterations and immunophenotypic abnormalities have been described in MSC obtained from HM patients. These data seem to confirm the defective biological pattern of MSC especially in myeloid diseases, while MSC cytogenetic profile in HM is still an open question, because it is not clear whether BM stromal cells are "culprit or bystander" displaying or not an abnormal karyotype. Contradictory findings were reported in different HM but the functional implications of altered MSC karyotype need to be further addressed also in light of a clinical use of MSC. A "pathological" in vivo supportive function of endogenous MSC, which provide important survival and drug resistance signals to leukemic cells especially in lymphoproliferative disorders, is suggested. Thus, the mechanisms underlying these protective versus cytotoxic effects exerted by MSC on leukemic cells need further investigations.

Breast cancer cells: Focus on the consequences of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY												Breast cancers are highly heterogeneous and successful treatment of those subtypes with a high frequency of metastases and resistance to clinically available therapies remains a challenge. An understanding of mechanisms which may contribute to this heterogeneity and generation of more resilient cancer cells is therefore essential. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic two-way process that occurs during embryonic development and wound healing whereby epithelial cells can gain plasticity and switch to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. EMT has received interest from cancer researchers due to its potential role in processes important in cancer progression and metastasis. Recent evidence has revealed a clear association between EMT and resistance to therapeutics. Targeting of EMT and/or the mesenchymal-like phenotype may be a promising avenue for future therapeutic intervention. This review provides a brief summary of the functional consequences of EMT in breast cancer, with a focus on the mesenchymal-like phenotype.

Among them, the two clinically interrelated subtypes, proneural and mesenchymal, are the most aggressive with proneural liable for conversion to mesenchymal upon therapy. Using two patient-derived novel primary cell culture models (MTA10 and KW10), we developed a minimal but unique four-gene signature comprising genes vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) and angiopoietin 1 (ANG1), angiopoietin 2 (ANG2) that effectively segregated the proneural (MTA10) and mesenchymal (KW10) glioblastoma subtypes. The cell culture preclassified as mesenchymal showed elevated expression of genes VEGF-A, VEGF-B and ANG1, ANG2 as compared to the other cell culture model that mimicked the proneural subtype. The differentially expressed genes in these two cell culture models were confirmed by us using TCGA and Verhaak databases and we refer to it as a minimal multigene signature (MMS). We validated this MMS on human glioblastoma tissue sections with the use of immunohistochemistry on preclassified (YKL-40 high or mesenchymal glioblastoma and OLIG2 high or proneural glioblastoma) tumor samples (n = 30). MMS segregated mesenchymal and proneural subtypes with 83% efficiency using a simple histopathology scoring approach (p = 0.008 for ANG2 and p = 0.01 for ANG1). Furthermore, MMS expression negatively correlated with patient survival. Importantly, MMS staining demonstrated spatiotemporal heterogeneity within each subclass, adding further complexity to subtype identification in glioblastoma. In conclusion, we report a novel and simple sequencing -independent histopathology-based biomarker signature comprising genes VEGF-A, VEGF-B and ANG1, ANG2 for subtyping of proneural and mesenchymal glioblastoma.

Single Cell Genomics Identifies Unique Cardioprotective Phenotype of Stem Cells derived from Epicardial Adipose Tissue under Ischemia	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												The conventional management strategies of myocardial infarction (MI) are effective to sustain life; however, myocardial regeneration has not been achieved owing to the inherently poor regenerative capacity of the native myocardium. Stem cell-based therapies are promising; however, lineage specificity and undesired differentiation profile are challenging. Herein, we focused on the epicardial fat (EF) as an ideal source for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) owing to the proximity and same microvasculature with cardiac muscle. Unfortunately, the epicardial adipose tissue derived stem cells (EATDS) remain understudied regarding their phenotype heterogeneity and cardiac regeneration potential. As EF closely reflects the cardiac pathology during ischemia, the present study aims to determine the EATDS subpopulations under simulated ischemic and reperfused conditions employing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). EATDS were isolated from three hyperlipidemic Yucatan microswine and were divided into Control, Ischemia (ISC), and Ischemia/reperfusion (ISC/R). The scRNAseq analysis was performed using 10 genomics platform which revealed 18 unique cell clusters suggesting the existence of heterogeneous phenotypes. The upregulated genes were taken into consideration and subsequent functional assessment revealed the cardioprotective phenotypes with diverse mechanisms including epigenetic regulation (Cluster 1), myocardial homeostasis (Cluster 1), cell integrity and cell cycle (Clusters 2 and 3), prevention of fibroblast differentiation (Cluster 4), differentiation to myocardial lineage (Cluster 6), anti-inflammatory responses (Clusters 5, 8, and 11), prevention of ER-stress (Cluster 9), and increasing the energy metabolism (Cluster 10). These unique phenotypes of heterogeneous EATDS population open significant translational opportunities for myocardial regeneration and cardiac management.

Effects of Direct Transplantation of Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells Into the Demyelinated Spinal Cord	CELL TRANSPLANTATION												The adult bone marrow contains a population of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), defined by plastic adherence. expression of stromal Cell Surface markers, and differentiation into mesenchymal lineages. There has been much interest in the possible therapeutic use of MSCs in the treatment of demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system. One therapeutic possibility is that these cells may be able to remyelinate when directly injected into the demyelinated spinal cord. Here we examine the effects of direct transplantation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled MSCs into a model of focal spinal cord demyelination induced by ethidium bromide. We demonstrate that direct intralesional injection of undifferentiated MSCs does not lead to remyelination. Furthermore, we report that transplanted MSCs migrate into areas of normal tissue. deposit Collagen. and are associated with axonal damage. These findings support the need for further experimental evaluation of the safety and efficacy of direct parenchymal injection of MSCs into demyelinated lesions and highlight tin important issue regarding potential clinical consequences of Culture heterogeneity of MSCs between centers.																	0963-6897	1555-3892					2008	17	7					865	873		10.3727/096368908786516738							WOS:000260863800013	19044212

A concept describing the origin of intra-tumoral heterogeneity is the cancer stem-cell hypothesis, proposing the existence of cancer stem cells that can self-renew limitlessly and therefore lead to tumor progression. Clonal evolution in accumulated single cell genomic alterations is a further possible explanation in carcinogenesis. In this study, we addressed the question whether intra-tumoral heterogeneity can be reliably detected in tissue-micro-arrays in breast cancer by comparing expression levels of conventional predictive/prognostic tumor markers, tumor progression markers and stem cell markers between central and peripheral tumor areas. Methods: We analyzed immunohistochemical expression and/or gene amplification status of conventional prognostic tumor markers (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6), tumor progression markers (PTEN, PIK3CA, p53, Ki-67) and stem cell markers (mTOR, SOX2, SOX9, SOX10, SLUG, CD44, CD24, TWIST) in 372 tissue-micro-array samples from 72 breast cancer patients. Expression levels were compared between central and peripheral tumor tissue areas and were correlated to histopathological grading. 15 selected cases additionally underwent RNA sequencing for transcriptome analysis. Results: No significant difference in any of the analyzed between central and peripheral tumor areas was seen with any of the analyzed methods/or results that showed difference. Except mTOR, PIK3CA and SOX9 (nuclear) protein expression, all markers correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with histopathological grading both in central and peripheral areas. Conclusion: Our results suggest that intra-tumoral heterogeneity of stem-cell and tumor-progression markers cannot be reliably addressed in tissue-micro-array samples in breast cancer. However, most markers correlated strongly with histopathological grading confirming prognostic information as expression profiles were independent on the site of the biopsy was taken.

Mechanobiological conditioning of mesenchymal stem cells for enhanced vascular regeneration	NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING												Human mesenchymal stem cells can be mechanically and pharmacologically conditioned to enhance vascular regeneration in vivo, as shown in mice with hindlimb ischaemia. Using endogenous mesenchymal stem cells for treating myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular conditions typically results in poor efficacy, in part owing to the heterogeneity of the harvested cells and of the patient responses. Here, by means of high-throughput screening of the combinatorial space of mechanical-strain level and of the presence of particular kinase inhibitors, we show that human mesenchymal stem cells can be mechanically and pharmacologically conditioned to enhance vascular regeneration in vivo. Mesenchymal stem cells conditioned to increase the activation of signalling pathways mediated by Smad2/3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3) and YAP (Yes-associated protein) expressed markers that are associated with pericytes and endothelial cells, displayed increased angiogenic activity in vitro, and enhanced the formation of vasculature in mice after subcutaneous implantation and after implantation in ischaemic hindlimbs. These effects were mediated by the crosstalk of endothelial-growth-factor receptors, transforming-growth-factor-beta receptor type 1 and vascular-endothelial-growth-factor receptor 2. Mechanical and pharmacological conditioning can significantly enhance the regenerative properties of mesenchymal stem cells.

This study evaluated the effect of intra-myocardial MSC transplantation on myocardial function following MI. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing donor MSCs from C57BL/6-Tg (UBC-GFP) 30Scha/J mice were transplanted into LV free wall in the region bordering an infarct in C57 recipient mice following ligation of left main coronary artery (MI + MSC group). Ten days after MI, LV function was assessed using echocardiography. Cardiomyocyte contractility and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured in cells from the area-at-risk surrounding the infarct scar. The EGFP donor cells were traced in the MSC recipient mice using fluorescence microscopy. TUNEL, H&E and Masson trichrome staining were used to assess apoptosis, angiogenesis and myocardial fibrosis, respectively. MI dilated LV as evidenced by increased end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters. MI significantly reduced fractional shortening, cardiomyocyte peak shortening, and maximal velocity of shortening and relengthening, all of which were attenuated or abrogated by MSC therapy. MI also reduced resting intracellular Ca2+, intracellular Ca2+ rise and decay rate, which were reconciled by MSC. MSC therapy attenuated MI-induced apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis but not myocardial fibrosis in the pen-infarct area. Taken together, our results demonstrated that MSC therapy significantly improved both LV and cardiomyocyte function possibly associated with its beneficial role in apoptosis and angiogenesis, indicating a key role for cardiomyocytes in stem cell tissue engineering.

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblastsin vitro	FEBS OPEN BIO												Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key components of the dense, proliferating stroma observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and CAF subpopulations drive tumor heterogeneity and play a major role in PDAC progression and drug resistance. CAFs consist of heterogenous subpopulations such as myoblastic CAF (myCAF) and inflammatory CAF (iCAF), and each has distinct essential roles. However, it is not clear how CAF subpopulations are formed in PDAC. Adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), which possess a high multilineage potential and self-renewal capacity, are reported to be one of thein vivoCAF sources. Here, we aimed to investigate whether AD-MSCs can act as precursors for CAFsin vitro. We recorded morphological features and collected omics data from twoin vitroco-culture models for recapitulating clinical PDAC. Additionally, we tested the advantages of the co-culture model in terms of accurately modeling morphology and CAF heterogeneity. We showed that AD-MSCs differentiate into two distinct CAF subpopulations: Direct contact co-culture with PDAC cell line Capan-1 induced differentiation into myCAFs and iCAFs, while indirect co-culture induced differentiation into only iCAFs. Using these co-culture systems, we also identified novel CAF markers that may be helpful for elucidating the mechanisms of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In conclusion, AD-MSCs can differentiate into distinct CAF subtypes depending on the different co-culture conditionsin vitro, and the identification of potential CAF markers may aid in future investigations of the mechanisms underlying the role of CAFs in the TME.

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) on EMT of cancer cells and to further investigate the mechanisms involved. We demonstrate that conditioned medium from ASCs induces breast cancer cells (4T1) to express mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin, alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Flow cytometry analyses show that ASC-conditioned medium promotes the expansion of CD44high/CD24low cancer stem cells. Soft agar assays using T47D, BT474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells reveals that ASC conditioned medium promotes the anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells. These effects were inhibited by a neutralizing antibody against platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D). Furthermore, PDGF-D treated breast cancer cells grow faster in a mouse model, and this effect could be neutralized by a PDGF antibody. In conclusion, our data show that tissue-resident stem cells interact with the cancer microenvironment via PDGF-D, induce EMT in the cancer cells in a paracrine fashion, thereby increasing the number of cancer stem cells and increase tumor growth in a PDGF dependent manner. Our findings shed new light on mechanisms where local tissue-resident stem cells are able to promote the growth of breast cancer cells. Possibly this could open up a novel selective therapeutic strategy targeting EMT pathways and the specific communication between tissue-resident normal stem cell and cancer stem cells, assuming that the blockage of PDGF-D pathways is critical for tumor growth but would not affect normal tissue homeostasis.																	0020-7136					SEP 1	2012	131	5					1023	1031		10.1002/ijc.26493							WOS:000305756900029	22038895

Better understanding of tumor initiation and development will help to resolve this problem. Current models explaining intratumoral diversity include cancer stem cells, clonal evolution and cancer cell dedifferentiation and reprogramming. Herein, a new model, cancer transmission, is proposed to explain cancer heterogeneity. We found breast cancer cells (MCF10A.NeuT) were capable of transforming normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A). The transformed cells exhibited cancerous properties including enhanced proliferation and migration, loss of apical-basal polarity and depolarized acini structure associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transformed MCF10A cells displayed distinct EMT characteristics compared to parental cells. We further showed that cancer cell-secreted factors were sufficient to induce cancerous transformation of normal cells. Furthermore, transformed cells were resistant to radiation treatment, providing new insights into mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance.

In this study, we show that the mesenchymal-transitioned cancer cells instigate the invasive ability and metastatic potential of the neighboring epithelial cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We identify WNT3 and WNT5B as critical factors secreted from Transforming growth factor-induced mesenchymal cancer cells for instigating the epithelial cancer cell invasion along with the induction of secondary EMT phenotype. These results shed light on the significance of cancer heterogeneity and the interaction between epithelial and mesenchymal-transitioned cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment in promoting metastatic disease through the WNT-dependent mechanism.

CD146/MCAM Surface Marker for Identifying Human Periodontal Ligament-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells	JOURNAL OF HARD TISSUE BIOLOGY												Identification of the specific subset of periodontal ligament-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDLSCs) will permit the development and improvement of current periodontal regeneration therapy. A popular approach for the isolation of a subset of PDLSCs would be to use cell surface markers to identify these cells, which are effectively enriched in order to isolate stem cells. The CD146 marker is most commonly used to isolate PDLSCs from human periodontal ligament tissues (hPDL). Previous studies have shown that CD146-positive (CD146+) cells possess potencies of high self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. However, the capability and potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in hPDL-derived CD146-negative (CD146-) cells have not been well established. In this study, CD146+ and CD146- cells were isolated from hPDL, and their properties, including their MSCs potential, were characterized. hPDL was obtained from healthy premolars (n = 10) extracted for orthodontic reasons. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the average proportion of CD146+ cells was about 50%. An approximately 20% fraction of cells with the highest CD146 expression was sorted as CD146+ cells and an approximately 20% fraction with the lowest CD146 expression was sorted as CD146- cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell cultures were assessed for their colony-forming efficiency, proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. Approximately 20% of CD146+ cells had replicative potential and formed single-cell colonies. The colony-forming efficiency of CD146+ cells was approximately twofold higher than for CD146- cells. Cell proliferation measured by cell-cycle analysis and cell counting showed that the proliferative potential of CD146+ cells was higher than that of CD146- cells. Cell differentiation potential in vitro was determined by real-time PCR and cell staining with alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red S for osteogenic differentiation, Oil Red O for adipogenic differentiation, and Alcian Blue for chondrogenic differentiation. The levels of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were significantly higher in CD146+ cells than in CD146- cells under appropriate conditions. The level of glycosaminoglycan and gene expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in CD146- cell pellets were higher than in CD146+ cell pellets. These results suggest that CD146+ cells possess bi-potent differentiation potential whereas CD146- cells possess unipotent differentiation potential.

Methods: We introduced a high-throughput screening platform to identify surface antigens that associate with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in well-defined pairs of epithelial cell lines and their mesenchymal counterparts. Using multicolour flow cytometry, we then analysed the expression of 10 most robustly changed antigens and identified a 10-molecule surface signature, in pan-cytokeratin-positive/EpCAM-positive and -negative fractions of dissociated breast tumours. Results: We found that surface CD9, CD29, CD49c, and integrin beta 5 are lost in breast cancer cells that underwent EMT in vivo. The tetraspanin family member CD9 was concordantly downregulated both in vitro and in vivo and associated with epithelial phenotype and favourable prognosis. Conclusions: We propose that overall landscape of 10-molecule surface signature expression reflects the epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer.

Human umbilical cord cells (HUVECs) are important effector cells in angiogenesis and are indispensable for osteogenesis and for their heterogeneity and plasticity. However, there are very few studies about the effects of HUVECs on diode laser-stimulated/regulated osteogenesis. In this study, we used diode laser as a model biostimulation to examine the role of HUVECs on laser-stimulated osteogenesis. Several bone formation-related proteins were also significantly up-regulated by the diode laser stimulation, indicating that HUVECs may participate in diode laser-stimulated osteogenesis. Interestingly, when human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) cultured with HUVECs were diode laser-treated, the osteogenesis differentiation of the hMSCs was significantly promoted, indicating the important role of HUVECs in diode laser-enhanced osteogenesis. Adequately activated HUVECs are vital for the success of diode laser-stimulated hard-tissue regeneration. These findings provided valuable insights into the mechanism of diode laser-stimulated osteogenic differentiation, and a strategy to optimize the evaluation system for the in vitro osteogenesis capacity of laser treatment in periodontal repair.

Mesenchymal stem cells for therapeutic applications in pulmonary medicine	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN												Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of different biological sources are in Phase 1 clinical trials and are being considered for Phase 2 therapy of lung disorders, and lung (progenitor) cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (SCs) are under development in preclinical animal models. Sources of data: PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov. Areas of agreement: There is consensus about the therapeutic potential of transplanted SCs, mainly MSCs, primarily involves paracrine 'bystander' effects that confer protection of the epithelial and endothelial linings of the lung caused by inflammation and/or fibrosis and lead to increased survival in animal models. Clinical trials of Phase 1 indicate safety and suggest that the efficacy of SC therapy in patients with various lung diseases will require a higher dosage than previously evaluated. Areas of controversy: A growing interest in the re-epithelialization and re-endothelialization of damaged lung tissue involves the putative pulmonary differentiation of exogenous MSCs. Currently, it is not clear whether or not the observed regeneration of distal airways/vasculature is derived from lung-resident and/or transplanted SCs. Growing points: Important topics under investigation include optimization of the cell source with a decrease in cell population heterogeneity characterized by defined markers, route of delivery for effective treatment, potential dose and therapeutic protocol of SC application, development of quantitative assays and biomarkers of lung disease and repair, and the potential use of tissue engineered lung. Areas timely for developing research: Ability of MSCs to differentiate into epithelial cells of the lung, use of autologous induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs) derived from the patients, complete biochemical characterization of the secretome of SCs used for therapy, and the incorporation of simultaneous and/or subsequent treatment with drugs which also aid in lung repair and regeneration. Cautionary note: Although safety of MSC-based cell therapy was proved in Phase 1, efficacy, long-term survival and preservation of lung respiratory function need to be further evaluated, cautioning against hastily translating SCs therapy from animal models of lung injury to clinical trials of patients with lung disorders.

MSCs assess extracellular elasticity by probing resistance to applied forces via adhesion, cytoskeletal, and nuclear mechanotransducers that direct differentiation to-ward soft or stiff tissue lineages. Even under controlled culture conditions, MSC differentiation exhibits substantial cell-to-cell var-iation that remains poorly characterized. By single-cell transcrip-tional profiling of nonconditioned, matrix-conditioned, and early differentiating cells, we identified distinct MSC subpopulations with distinct mechanosensitivities, differentiation capacities, and cell cycling. We show that soft matrices support adipogenesis of multipotent cells and early endochondral ossification of nonadipo-genic cells, whereas intramembranous ossification and preosteo-blast proliferation are directed by stiff matrices. Using diffusion pseudotime mapping, we outline hierarchical matrix-directed dif-ferentiation and perform whole-genome screening of mechanor-esponsive genes. Specifically, top-ranked tropomyosin-1 is highly sensitive to stiffness cues both at RNA and protein levels, and changes in TPM1 expression determine the differentiation toward soft versus stiff tissue lineage. Consistent with actin stress fiber stabilization, tropomyosin-1 overexpression maintains YAP1 nuclear localization, activates YAP1 target genes, and directs osteogenic dif-ferentiation. Knockdown of tropomyosin-1 reversed YAP1 nuclear localization consistent with relaxation of cellular contractility, sup -pressed osteogenesis, activated early endochondral ossification genes after 3 d of culture in induction medium, and facilitated adi-pogenic differentiation after 1 wk. Our results delineate cell-to-cell variation of matrix-directed MSC differentiation and highlight tropomyosin-mediated matrix sensing.

This study provides a detailed immunohistochemical and stereological analysis of the localization and distribution of exogenous MSC in a pig model of lung transplantation after intravascular or endobronchial application. Methods MSC derived from human bone marrow were labeled by DiI and administered intravascularly or endobronchially to the lungs of donor pigs after a period of 3 hours warm and 3 hours cold ischemia. The left lung was transplanted to a recipient pig and reperfused for 4 hours before fixation. The right donor lung was fixed for microscopic analysis directly after the ischemia time. Results After both administration routes, a similar number of exogenous MSC was found in the lungs. Within each animal, the heterogeneity of MSC distribution was high both with respect to left and right lung as well as to the different lobes of each lung. After endobronchial application, MSC were found in alveolar and bronchial/bronchiolar lumen, whereas after intravascular administration, they were mainly observed in blood vessels. Conclusion Although the administration of exogenous MSC is possible by endobronchial or intravascular application, it yields a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs which may warrant strategies to improve a more homogeneous distribution.

In addition to the conventional epithelial antibody of anti-EpCAM, our in-house produced anti-63B6 antibody targets mesenchymal stem cell-like cancer cells and intermediate cancer cells, thus overcoming limitation of the conventional single anti-EpCAM based CTC isolations. These two antibodies are immobilized to each top and bottom layer of the present device and the combination of two layers forms a circular chamber with the center inlet. The mutual complementary cell isolation through competing reaction in different velocity zones between mesenchymal and epithelial antibodies enables the precise screening and profiling of CTCs depending on their positivity and degree of epithelial/mesenchymal surface antigen expression, which may differ in compliance with disease status. From the experiments using epithelial and mesenchymal-like cancer cells, the present device captures 94.47% of cancer cells, which is substantially higher than the EpCAM-only-based method in terms of heterogeneous cancer cell isolation including mesenchymallike cancer cells. Patient blood samples were employed to assess the clinical application of the present device for examining the patient status based on their CTC heterogeneity. The CTCs captured by both antibodies exhibit considerably varied expression profiles of epithelial protein including cytokeratin and EpCAM. The present device facilitates the isolation of heterogeneous subtypes of CTCs. These undiscovered heterogeneities would be helpful for precise analysis of CTCs to find their underlying meaning in cancer progression. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This heterogeneity is attributed to the presence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which determines resistance to chemotherapy and subsequently disease recurrence and metastasis. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate the morphological and phenotypic cellular heterogeneity of two TNBC cell lines cultured in monolayer and tumorsphere (TS) models by fluorescence and electron microscopy and flow cytometry. The BT-549 and Hs 578T analyses demonstrated large phenotypic and morphological heterogeneity between these cell lines, as well as between the cell subpopulations that compose them. BT-549 and Hs 578T are heterogeneous considering the cell surface marker CD44 and CD24 expression, characterizing BCSC mesenchymal-like cells (CD44(+)/CD24(-)), epithelial cells (CD44(-)/CD24(+)), hybrid cells with mesenchymal and epithelial features (CD44(+)/CD24(+)), and CD44(-)/CD24(-) cells. BCSC epithelial-like cells (ALDH(+)) were found in BT-549, BT-549 TS, and Hs 578T TS; however, only BT-549 TS showed a high ALDH activity. Ultrastructural characterization showed the heterogeneity within and among BT-549 and Hs 578T in monolayer and TS models being formed by more than one cellular type. Further, the mesenchymal characteristic of these cells is demonstrated by E-cadherin absence and filopodia. It is well known that tumor cell heterogeneity can influence survival, therapy responses, and the rate of tumor growth. Thus, molecular understanding of this heterogeneity is essential for the identification of potential therapeutic options and vulnerabilities of oncological patients.

A molecular classification of human mesenchymal stromal cells	PEERJ												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are widely used for the study of mesenchymal tissue repair, and increasingly adopted for cell therapy, despite the lack of consensus on the identity of these cells. In part this is due to the lack of specificity of MSC markers. Distinguishing MSC from other stromal cells such as fibroblasts is particularly difficult using standard analysis of surface proteins, and there is an urgent need for improved classification approaches. Transcriptome profiling is commonly used to describe and compare different cell types; however, efforts to identify specific markers of rare cellular subsets may be confounded by the small sample sizes of most studies. Consequently, it is difficult to derive reproducible, and therefore useful markers. We addressed the question of MSC classification with a large integrative analysis of many public MSC datasets. We derived a sparse classifier (The Rohart MSC test) that accurately distinguishedMSCfrom non-MSC samples with >97% accuracy on an internal training set of 635 samples from 41 studies derived on 10 different microarray platforms. The classifier was validated on an external test set of 1,291 samples from 65 studies derived on 15 different platforms, with >95% accuracy. The genes that contribute to the MSC classifier formed a protein-interaction network that included known MSC markers. Further evidence of the relevance of this new MSC panel came from the high number of Mendelian disorders associated with mutations in more than 65% of the network. These result in mesenchymal defects, particularly impacting on skeletal growth and function. The RohartMSCtest is a simple in silico test that accurately discriminates MSC from fibroblasts, other adult stem/progenitor cell types or differentiated stromal cells. It has been implemented in the www.stemformatics.org resource, to assist researchers wishing to benchmark their own MSC datasets or data from the public domain. The code is available from the CRAN repository and all data used to generate the MSC test is available to download via the Gene Expression Omnibus or the Stemformatics resource.

Understanding the Molecular Basis of Heterogeneity in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells	CELLULAR REPROGRAMMING												Reprogramming of somatic cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has considerable latency and generates epigenetically distinct partially and fully reprogrammed clones. To understand the molecular basis of reprogramming and to distinguish the partially reprogrammed iPSC clones (pre-iPSCs), we analyzed several of these clones for their molecular signatures. Using a combination of markers that are expressed at different stages of reprogramming, we found that the partially reprogrammed stable clones have significant morphological and molecular heterogeneity in their response to transition to the fully pluripotent state. The pre-iPSCs had significant levels of OCT4 expression but exhibited variable levels of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. These novel molecular signatures that we identified would help in using these cells to understand the molecular mechanisms in the late of stages of reprogramming. Although morphologically similar mouse iPSC clones showed significant heterogeneity, the human iPSC clones isolated initially on the basis of morphology were highly homogeneous with respect to the levels of pluripotency.

Optimized Media Volumes Enable Homogeneous Growth of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Engineered Cartilage Constructs	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Impact statement The translation of engineered cartilage therapeutics is hindered by our inability to grow mechanically robust tissue constructs with uniform properties. In most instances, the center regions of tissue constructs are mechanically inferior due to limitations in nutrient supply. This study demonstrates a simple and easily adoptable approach for growing homogeneous tissue constructs in a time-efficient manner through increased media volumes during in vitro culture. Despite marked advances in the field of cartilage tissue engineering, it remains a challenge to engineer cartilage constructs with homogeneous properties. Moreover, for engineered cartilage to make it to the clinic, this homogeneous growth must occur in a time-efficient manner. In this study we investigated the potential of increased media volume to expedite the homogeneous maturation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) laden engineered constructs over time in vitro. We assessed the MSC-laden constructs after 4 and 8 weeks of chondrogenic culture using bulk mechanical, histological, and biochemical measures. These assays were performed on both the intact total constructs and the construct cores to elucidate region-dependent differences. In addition, local strain transfer was assessed to quantify depth-dependent mechanical properties throughout the constructs. Our findings suggest that increased media volume enhances matrix deposition early in culture and ameliorates unwanted regional heterogeneities at later time points. Taken together, these data support the use of higher media volumes during in vitro culture to hasten tissue maturation and increase the core strength of tissue constructs. These findings will forward the field of cartilage tissue engineering and the translation of tissue engineered constructs.																	1937-3341	1937-335X				FEB 1	2021	27	3-4					214	222		10.1089/ten.tea.2020.0123		NOV 2020					WOS:000586389400001	32552444

In spite of recent efforts, the metabolic reprogramming associated with CSC phenotypes uncoupled from EMT is poorly understood. Here, by using metabolomic and fluxomic approaches, we identify major metabolic profiles that differentiate metastatic prostate epithelial CSCs (e-CSCs) from non-CSCs expressing a stable EMT. We have found that the e-CSC program in our cellular model is characterized by a high plasticity in energy substrate metabolism, including an enhanced Warburg effect, a greater carbon and energy source flexibility driven by fatty acids and amino acid metabolism and an essential reliance on the proton buffering capacity conferred by glutamine metabolism. An analysis of transcriptomic data yielded a metabolic gene signature for our e-CSCs consistent with the metabolomics and fluxomics analyses that correlated with tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer and in 11 additional cancer types. Interestingly, an integrated metabolomics, fluxomics, and transcriptomics analysis allowed us to identify key metabolic players regulated at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to effectively forestall metastasis.

Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is generally accepted as an chondrogenic agent, but immunorejection and unexpected side effects, such as tumorigenesis and heterogeneity, limit its clinical application. Autogenous platelet-rich plasma (PRP), marked by low immunogenicity, easy accessibility, and low-cost, may be favorable for cartilage regeneration. In our study, the effect of PRP on engineered cartilage constructed by MSCs and collagen hydrogel in vitro and in vivo was investigated and compared with TGF-1. The results showed that PRP promoted cell proliferation and gene and protein expressions of chondrogenic markers via the TGF-/SMAD signaling pathway. Meanwhile, it suppressed the expression of collagen type I, a marker of fibrocartilage. Furthermore, PRP accelerated cartilage regeneration on defects with engineered cartilage, advantageous over TGF-1, as evaluated by histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our work demonstrates that autogenous PRP may substitute TGF-1 as a potent and reliable chondrogenic inducer for therapy of cartilage defect.

Functional heterogeneity of IFN-gamma-licensed mesenchymal stromal cell immunosuppressive capacity on biomaterials	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are increasingly combined with biomaterials to enhance their therapeutic properties, including their immunosuppressive function. However, clinical trials utilizing MSCs with or without biomaterials have shown limited success, potentially due to their functional heterogeneity across different donors and among different subpopulations of cells. Here, we evaluated the immunosuppressive capacity, as measured by the ability to reduce T-cell proliferation and activation, of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)-licensed MSCs from multiple donors on fibrin and collagen hydro gels, the two most commonly utilized biomaterials in combination with MSCs in clinical trials worldwide according to ClinicalTrials. gov. Variations in the immunosuppressive capacity between IFN gamma-licensed MSC donors on the biomaterials correlated with the magnitude of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity. Immunosuppressive capacity of the IFN-gamma-licensed MSCs depended on the alpha V/alpha 5 integrins when cultured on fibrin and on the alpha 2/131 integrins when cultured on collagen. While all tested MSCs were nearly 100% positive for these integrins, sorted MSCs that expressed higher levels of alpha V/alpha 5 integrins demonstrated greater immunosuppressive capacity with IFN-gamma licensing than MSCs that expressed lower levels of these integrins on fibrin. These findings were equivalent for MSCs sorted based on the alpha 2/131 integrins on collagen. These results demonstrate the importance of integrin engagement to IFN-gamma licensed MSC immunosuppressive capacity and that IFN-gamma-licensed MSC subpopulations of varying immunosuppressive capacity can be identified by the magnitude of integrin expression specific to each biomaterial.

Intestinal stem cells and the colorectal cancer microenvironment	WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY												Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a highly fatal condition in part due to its resilience to treatment and its propensity to spread beyond the site of primary occurrence. One possible avenue for cancer to escape eradication is via stem-like cancer cells that, through phenotypic heterogeneity, are more resilient than other tumor constituents and are key contributors to cancer growth and metastasis. These proliferative tumor cells are theorized to possess many properties akin to normal intestinal stem cells. Not only do these CRC "stem" cells demonstrate similar restorative ability, they also share many cell pathways and surface markers in common, as well as respond to the same key niche stimuli. With the improvement of techniques for epithelial stem cell identification, our understanding of CRC behavior is also evolving. Emerging evidence about cellular plasticity and epithelial mesenchymal transition are shedding light onto metastatic CRC processes and are also challenging fundamental concepts about unidirectional epithelial proliferation. This review aims to reappraise evidence supporting the existence and behavior of CRC stem cells, their relationship to normal stem cells, and their possible dependence on the stem cell niche.

Multi-differentiation potential is necessary for optimal tenogenesis of tendon stem cells	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background Tendon injury is a significant clinical problem due to poor healing and a high reinjury rate; successful treatment is limited by our poor understanding of endogenous tendon stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that adult stem cells are phenotypically diverse, even when comparing stem cells isolated from the same tissue from the same individual, and may in fact exist on a spectrum of proliferation and differentiation capacities. Additionally, the relationships between and clinical relevance of this phenotypic variation are poorly understood. In particular, tenogenic capacity has not been studied in comparison to tenogenic differentiation and cell proliferation. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive assessment of cell proliferation and differentiation capacity toward four connective tissue lineages (tendon, cartilage, bone, and adipose) using tendon stem cell lines derived from single cells released directly from tendon tissue to (1) evaluate the differences, if any, in tenogenic potential, and (2) identify the relationships between differentiation phenotypes and proliferation capacity. Methods Tendon stem cells were derived from the endotenon of superficial digital flexor tendon from 3 horses. The cell suspension from each horse was separately plated simultaneously (1) at moderate density to generate a heterogenous population of cells-parent tendon cell line-and (2) at low density to separate single cells from each other to allow isolation of colonies that derive from single mother cells-clonal tendon stem cell lines. Thirty clonal tendon stem cell lines-10 from each horse-and each parent tendon cell line were assessed for tenogenesis, tri-lineage differentiation, and cell proliferation. Differentiation was confirmed by lineage-specific cell staining and quantified by the relative gene expression of lineage-specific markers. Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey's tests. Results Three distinct differentiation phenotypes-differentiation potency toward all 4 tissue lineages and two tri-lineage differentiation potencies-were identified in tendon clonal stem cell lines. These phenotypes were differentiation toward (1) tendon, cartilage, bone, and adipose (TCOA); (2) tendon, cartilage, and bone (TCO); and (3) tendon, cartilage, and adipose (TCA). Further, clonal cell lines that differentiated toward all four lineages had the highest expression of scleraxis and mohawk upon tenogenesis. Moreover, cell proliferation was significantly different between phenotypic groups, as evidenced by increased numbers of cumulative cell population doublings in clonal cell lines that did not differentiate toward adipose. Conclusions Our study provides evidence of the heterogenous character of adult stem cells and identifies key differences in tendon stem cell differentiation and proliferative potentials from the same individual and from the same tendon. Isolation of tendon stem cell lines with the capacity to differentiate into all four connective tissue lineages may yield improved therapeutic benefits in clinical models of repair and promote a native, regenerative phenotype in engineered tendons. Future studies may be targeted to understanding the functional contributions of each tendon stem cell phenotype in vivo and identifying additional cell phenotypes.

The most aggressive melanoma may contain deregulated cells with undifferentiated/stem cell-like phenotype. A critical mechanism by which melanoma cells enhance their invasive capacity is the dissolution of the intercellular adhesion and the acquisition of mesenchymal features as a part of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of a stem cell-like population in human melanomas by means of melanocytic cell culture analysis obtained from distinct histotypes of primary and metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients with advanced melanoma > 2 cm in diameter and/or > 300 mm(2) surface were enrolled. The melanoma cells were isolated from skin biopsies of lentigo maligna melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. The colony forming unit assay and alkaline phosphatase stain were evaluated. Cells were subsequently cultured and maintained in different media to evaluate their ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis were performed to evaluate antigenic markers CD90, CD73, CD105, CD146, CD20, CD166, and Nestin. This study confirms that melanoma can include heterogenous cell populations with the ability both to self-renew and to a give rise to differentiated progeny. Melanoma cells displayed intratumoral heterogeneity and dynamic antigen phenotypes. Histologically, transitions from normal skin to melanoma were associated with a gradual increase in the expression of CD146, CD20, CD133, Nestin, and CD73. These molecular profiles could be further analyzed and, in the future, used for the development of novel biomolecular targeted-therapy approaches.				pellacani, giovanni/E-8573-2011; Magnoni, Cristina/F-5367-2017; Ponti, Giovanni/A-5565-2012; Tomasi, Aldo/F-8513-2017; Bertazzoni, Giorgia/A-6286-2012; Longo, Caterina/A-8046-2012	pellacani, giovanni/0000-0002-7222-2951; Magnoni, Cristina/0000-0002-6081-4925; Ponti, Giovanni/0000-0002-1971-7306; Tomasi, Aldo/0000-0002-1356-3430; Longo, Caterina/0000-0002-8218-3896; azzoni, paola/0000-0002-6417-5251; DE POL, Anto/0000-0003-4279-5422												1541-2016	1533-4058				MAR	2014	22	3					171	181		10.1097/PAI.0b013e31828ff701							WOS:000333057100003	23702651

So, this study was designed to isolate and enrich clones of multipotent and self-renewing MSCs from cord blood (CB). Enriched clones with higher proliferation and differentiation potential provide regenerative cells suitable for various clinical demands. MSCA and MSCB original (progenitor) cells were isolated from CB samples, and single cells were cloned by limiting dilution method, in mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned media. Original MSCs and their single-cell derived clones were characterized by identifying their proliferation rate, immunophenotyping of surface antigens, expression of pluripotency and proliferation genes (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, c-Myc, and PDGFRA), and differentiation potential into multiple lineages (osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic). Some single-cell clones of MSCA showed a higher proliferation rate and greater differentiation potential than their original cells. However, original MSCB cells were of greater proliferation and differentiation potential than their derived single-cell clones, except for one clone which had comparable results. Cloning of MSCs was attainable when cultured in mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned media. Single clones with higher proliferation and differentiation potential than their original progenitor cells were obtained by cloning of poorly functioning MSCs progenitor cells, enabling the selection of more therapeutically efficacious MSCs with better performance in clinical applications. Moreover, this study draws attention to the importance of CD105 as a possible MSCs biomarker associated with the multilineage commitment of MSCs.

In this study, we aimed to identify the effect of interferon (IFN)-gamma priming on immunomodulation by MSCs and elucidate the possible mechanism underlying their properties for the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts. Infusion ofMSCs primed with IFN-gamma significantly reduced the symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) inNOD-SCIDmice, thereby increasing survival ratewhen comparedwith naive MSC-infused mice. However, infusion of IFN-gamma-primed MSCs in which indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was downregulated did not elicit this effect. The IDO gene was expressed in MSCs via the IFN-gamma-Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway, and the infusion of IDO-over-expressing MSCs increased survival rate in an in vivo GVHDmodel, similar to infusion of IFN-gamma-primed MSCs. These data indicate that IFN-gamma production by activated T-cells is correlated with the induction of IDO expression in MSCs via the IFN-gamma-JAK-STAT1 pathway, which in turn results in the suppression of T-cell proliferation. Our findings also suggest that cell therapy based on MSCs primed with IFN-gamma can be used for the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts, including GVHD. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Immunohistochemical Localization and Characterization of Putative Mesenchymal Stem Cell Markers in the Retinal Capillary Network of Rodents	CELLS TISSUES ORGANS												Perivascular cells of microvascular niches are the prime candidates for being a reservoire of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells in many tissues and organs that could serve as a potential source of cells and a target of novel cell-based therapeutic approaches. In the present study, by utilising typical markers of pericytes (neuronal-glial antigen 2, NG2, a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan) and those of MSCs (CD146 and CD105) and primitive pluripotent cells (sex-determining region Y-box 2, Sox2), the phenotypic traits and the distribution of murine and rat retinal perivascular cells were investigated in situ. Our findings indicate that retinal microvessels of juvenile rodents are highly covered by NG2-positive branching processes of pericytic (perivascular) cells that are less prominent in mature capillary networks of the adult retina. In the adult rodent retinal vascular bed, NG2 labeling is mainly confined to membranes of the cell body re-suiting in a pearl-chain-like distribution along the vessels. Retinal pericytes, which were identified by their morphology and NG2 expression, simultaneously express CD146. Furthermore, CD146-positive cells located at small arteriole-to-capillary branching points appear more intensely stained than elsewhere. Evidence for a differential expression of the two markers around capillaries that would hint at a clonal heterogeneity among pericytic cells, however, is lacking. In contrast, the expression of CD105 is exclusively restricted to vascular endothelial cells and Sox2 is detected neither in perivascular nor in endothelial cells. In dissociated retinal cultures, however, simultaneous expression of NG2 and CD105 was observed. Collectively, our data indicate that vascular wall resident retinal pericytes share some phenotypic features (i.e. CD146 expression) with archetypal MSCs, which is even more striking in dissociated retinal cultures (i.e. CD105 expression). These findings might have implications for the treatment of retinal pathologies. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

Factors promoting nerve cell ingrowth are considered responsible for chronic back pain resulting from the intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). One of the recent exploratory IDD treatments is stem cell transplantation therapy. The CD271 (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) has been identified as a marker of the most homogeneous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) subset. It is capable of promoting differentiation along adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages and producing significantly higher levels of cytokines as compared to the total population of plastic adherence-mesenchymal stem cells (PA-MSCs). We investigated the ability of CD271(+) MSCs to differentiate into chondrocyte-like cells of the nucleus pulposus (NP) of intervertebral disc. We also examined CD271(-) MSCs, using PA-MSCs as a control cell population. Material and methods. Bone marrow derived PA-MSCs and its two subsets, CD271(-) MSCs and CD271(+) MSCs, were seeded in collagen scaffolds. After two weeks of growth in NP-differentiation medium, RNA was isolated from cells-scaffold constructs and was analyzed by q-PCR for expression of NP markers. Glycosaminoglycans were analyzed biochemically directly in cells-scaffold constructs. Results. Expression of NP markers - extracellular matrix components such as aggrecan, collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans on both RNA and the protein levels - was significantly higher in CD271(-) MSCs compared to the CD271+ MSCs and PA-MSCs cell populations. Conclusions. CD271(-) MSCs may be superior candidates for NP restorative treatment compared to CD271(+) MSCs and PA-MSCs due to their ability of expressing NP-supporting extracellular matrix components at levels higher than the other two studied MSC subsets.

Combined mRNA and microRNA profiling reveals that miR-148a and miR-20b control human mesenchymal stem cell phenotype via EPAS1. Physiol Genomics 43: 77-86, 2011. First published November 16, 2010; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00077.2010.-Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in a wide variety of tissues during development of the human embryo starting as early as the first trimester. Gene expression profiling of these cells has focused primarily on the molecular signs characterizing their potential heterogeneity and their differentiation potential. In contrast, molecular mechanisms participating in the emergence of MSC identity in embryo are still poorly understood. In this study, human embryonic stem cells (hESs) were differentiated toward MSCs (ES-MSCs) to compare the genetic patterns between pluripotent hESs and multipotent MSCs by a large genomewide expression profiling of mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). After whole genome differential transcriptomic analysis, a stringent protocol was used to search for genes differentially expressed between hESs and ES-MSCs, followed by several validation steps to identify the genes most specifically linked to the MSC phenotype. A network was obtained that encompassed 74 genes in 13 interconnected transcriptional systems that are likely to contribute to MSC identity. Pairs of negatively correlated miRNAs and mRNAs, which suggest miRNA-target relationships, were then extracted and validation was sought with the use of Pre-miRs.

A stem cell-rich fraction referred to as side population (SP) cells also resides in skeletal muscle, but its roles in muscle regeneration remain unclear. We found that muscle SP cells could be subdivided into three sub-fractions using CD31 and CD45 markers. The majority of SP cells in normal non-regenerating muscle expressed CD31 and had endothelial characteristics. However, CD31(-)CD45(-)SP cells, which are a minor subpopulation in normal muscle, actively proliferated upon muscle injury and expressed not only several regulatory genes for muscle regeneration but also some mesenchymal lineage markers. CD31(-)CD45(-) SP cells showed the greatest myogenic potential among three SP sub-fractions, but indeed revealed mesenchymal potentials in vitro. These SP cells preferentially differentiated into myofibers after intramuscular transplantation in vivo. Our results revealed the heterogeneity of muscle SP cells and suggest that CD31(-)CD45(-) SP cells participate in muscle regeneration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cancer Stem Cells: Impact, Heterogeneity, and Uncertainty	CANCER CELL												The differentiation of tumorigenic cancer stem cells into nontumorigenic cancer cells confers heterogeneity to some cancers beyond that explained by clonal evolution or environmental differences. In such cancers, functional differences between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells influence response to therapy and prognosis. However, it remains uncertain whether the model applies to many, or few, cancers due to questions about the robustness of cancer stem cell markers and the extent to which existing assays underestimate the frequency of tumorigenic cells. In cancers with rapid genetic change, reversible changes in cell states, or biological variability among patients, the stem cell model may not be readily testable.

The lack of successful engraftment, migration into the injured site, loss of functionality and viability, ethical issues, shortage of donated allogeneic stem cells and the possibility of transmission of infectious are the main challenges associated with direct cell transplantation. The discovery and research on exosomes have led to the rise of hopes for the alleviation of different pathologies in regenerative medicine. Exo are nano-sized extracellular vesicles (40-150 nm) and released by each type. These nanoparticles participate in cell-to-cell communication in a paracrine manner. It is thought that the application of Exo can circumvent several drawbacks related to whole-cell therapies. Because of their appropriate size and stability, Exo are touted as therapeutic bullets transferring signaling factors into the acceptor cells in a paracrine manner. Despite these advantages, technologies associated with Exo isolation and purification are challenging because of heterogeneity in exosomal size and cargo. The lack of standard GMP-grade protocols is the main hurdle that limits the extensive application of Exo in the clinical setting. Here, the authors aimed to inspire a logical and realistic vision about problems associated with Exo application in regenerative medicine.

J	Heo, JS; Choi, Y; Kim, HS; Kim, HO				Heo, June Seok; Choi, Youjeong; Kim, Han-Soo; Kim, Hyun Ok			Comparison of molecular profiles of human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, placenta and adipose tissue	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are clinically useful due to their capacity for self-renewal, their immunomodulatory properties and tissue regenerative potential. These cells can be isolated from various tissues and exhibit different potential for clinical applications according to their origin, and thus comparative studies on MSCs from different tissues are essential. In this study, we investigated the immunophenotype, proliferative potential, multilineage differentiation and immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs derived from different tissue sources, namely bone marrow, adipose tissue, the placenta and umbilical cord blood. The gene expression profiles of stemness-related genes [octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), sex determining region Y-box (SOX)2, MYC, Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), NANOG, LIN28 and REX1] and lineage-related and differentiation stage-related genes [B4GALNT1 (GM2/GS2 synthase), inhibin, beta A (INHBA), distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPA), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) and SOX9] were compared using RT-PCR. No significant differences in growth rate, colony-forming efficiency and immunophenotype were observed. Our results demonstrated that MSCs derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue shared not only in vitro tri-lineage differentiation potential, but also gene expression profiles. While there was considerable inter-donor variation in DLX5 expression between MSCs derived from different tissues, its expression appears to be associated with the osteogenic potential of MSCs. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) significantly inhibited allogeneic T cell proliferation possibly via the high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines, IL10 and TGFB1. Although MSCs derived from different tissues and fibroblasts share many characteristics, some of the marker genes, such as B4GALNT1 and DLX5 may be useful for the characterization of MSCs derived from different tissue sources. Collectively, our results suggest that, based on their tri-lineage differentiation potential and immunomodulatory effects, BM-MSCs and adipose tissue-derived MSCs (A-MSCs) represent the optimal stem cell source for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Based on the assumption that stem cells reside in niches characterized by hypoxic condition, we investigated if the low oxygen tension may improve the proliferation and stemness of ADMSCs. Intact adipose tissue was resected from eight subjects, and the stromal vascular fraction was obtained by using type II collagenase. The heterogeneity of cellular lineages was confirmed by immunophenotypic analysis that showed the presence of leukocytes (CD45+), endothelial cells (CD34+), and pericytes (CD140+). The immunophenotype of confluent ADMSCs was similar to that of bone marrow-derived MSCs, except for the expression of CD34, which was variable (donor-dependent) and inversely correlated to the CD36 expression. ADMSCs showed a high clonal efficiency (94.5 +/- A 1 %) and were able to generate osteoblastic, chondrocytic and adipocytic lineages. ADMSCs were cultured under normoxic (21 % O-2) and hypoxic (1 % O-2) conditions, and we found that hypoxia significantly favoured ADMSC proliferation and preserved the expression of stemness genes, i.e. Nanog and Sox2. Since hypoxia reflects the microenvironment in which ADMSCs must proliferate and differentiate, the culture in hypoxic condition allows to better understand the biology of these cells and their regenerative potential. Low oxygen concentrations promote cell proliferation and stemness, thus enriching the pool of cells potentially able to differentiate into multi-lineages, and extending the possibility of a long-term expansion.

We report an improved prospective clonal isolation technique and reveal that the combination of three cell-surface markers (LNGFR, THY-1, and VCAM-1) allows for the selection of highly enriched clonogenic cells (one out of three isolated cells). Clonal characterization of LNGFR(+)THY-1(+) cells demonstrated cellular heterogeneity among the clones. Rapidly expanding clones (RECs) exhibited robust multilineage differentiation and self-renewal potency, whereas the other clones tended to acquire cellular senescence via P16INK4a and exhibited frequent genomic errors. Furthermore, RECs exhibited unique expression of VCAM-1 and higher cellular motility compared with the other clones. The combination marker LNGFR(+)THY-1(+)VCAM-1(hi+) (LTV) can be used selectively to isolate the most potent and genetically stable MSCs.

Method A total of 21 studies was analyzed. These, were indexed from PubMed and Embase databases. All data were analyzed by RevMan 5.1 and SPSS 17.0. Pooled analysis and multivariable meta-regression were calculated by random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias across the studies were also explored. Results Pooled analysis showed elevated serum creatinine (Scr) reduction in the animal models of renal failure following MSC therapy. By exploratory multivariable meta-regression, significant influence factors of Scr reduction were the time point of Scr measurement (early measurement showed greater reduction than the late (P=0.005)) and the route of MSC delivery (arterial delivery of MSCs caused greater reduction in elevated Scr, when compared with the intra-renal delivery and intravenous injection (P=0.040)). Subgroup analysis showed there tended to be greater reduction in Scr with higher MSC number (>106), the renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model, and late administration (>1 day) after injury. Conclusion The present meta-analysis confirmed that MSC therapy could improve impaired renal function. MSCs might get obvious effect in the early stage of renal injuries after arterial delivery. Further, this meta-analysis may provide important clues for animal experiments even for human clinical trials in MSC studies.

J	Nakano, I				Nakano, Ichiro			Stem cell signature in glioblastoma: therapeutic development for a moving target	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY												Tumor heterogeneity of adult high-grade glioma (HGG) is recognized in 3 major subtypes based on core gene signatures. However, the molecular signatures and clinical implications of glioma stem cells (GSCs) in individual HGG subtypes remain poorly characterized. Recently genome-wide transcriptional analysis identified two mutually exclusive GSC subtypes with distinct dysregulated signaling and metabolic pathways. Analysis of genetic profiles and phenotypic assays distinguished proneural (PN) from mesenchymal (MES) GSCs and revealed a striking correlation with the corresponding PN or MES HGGs. Similar to HGGs with a MES signature, MES GSCs display more aggressive phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, MES GSCs are markedly resistant to radiation as compared with PN GSCs, consistent with the relative radiation resistance of MES GBM compared with other subtypes. A systems biology approach has identified a set of transcription factors as the master regulators for the MES signature. Metabolic-reprogramming in MES GSCs has also been noticed with the prominent activation of the glycolytic pathway, comprising aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family genes. This review summarizes recent progress in the characterization of the molecular signature in distinct HGG and GSC subtypes and plasticity between different GSC subtypes as well as between GSCs and non-GSCs in HGG tumors. Clinical implications of the translational GSC research are also discussed.

The purpose of this study was to understand the level of heterogeneity among human dental pulp derived mesenchymal stem cells by using basic cell biology and proteomic approaches. The cells were isolated from a natal (NDPSCs), an exfoliated deciduous (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous (SHED)), and an impacted third molar (DPSCs) tooth of three different donors. All three stem cells displayed similar features related to morphology, proliferation rates, expression of various cell surface markers, and differentiation potentials into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Furthermore, using 2DE approach coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF, we have generated a common 2DE profile for all three stem cells. We found that 62.3 +/- 7% of the protein spots were conserved among the three mesenchymal stem cell lines. Sixty-one of these conserved spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Classification of the identified proteins based on biological function revealed that structurally important proteins and proteins that are involved in protein folding machinery are predominantly expressed by all three stem cell lines. Some of these proteins may hold importance in understanding specific properties of human dental pulp derived mesenchymal stem cells.

The most abundant source to isolate MSCs is adipose tissue. Currently, perirenal adipose tissue is rarely described as the source of MSCs. MSCs were isolated from perirenal adipose tissue (prASCs) from patients undergoing tumor nephrectomies, cultured and characterized by flow cytometry and their differentiation potential into adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and epithelial cells. Furthermore, prASCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or a mixture of cytokines (cytomix). In addition, prASC susceptibility to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated. The expression of inflammatory readouts was estimated by qPCR and immunoassay. HCMV infection was analyzed by qPCR and immunostaining. Characterization of cultured prASCs shows the cells meet the criteria of MSCs and prASCs can undergo trilineage differentiation. Cultured prASCs can be induced to differentiate into epithelial cells, shown by cytokeratin 18 expression. Stimulation of prASCs with LPS or cytomix suggests the cells are capable of initiating an inflammation-like response upon stimulation with LPS or cytokines, whereas, LTA did not induce a significant effect on the readouts (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF alpha, MCP-1 mRNA and IL-6 protein). HCMV broadly infects prASCs, showing a viral load dependent cytopathological effect (CPE). Our current study summarizes the isolation and culture of prASCs, clearly characterizes the cells, and demonstrates their immunomodulatory potential and high permissiveness for HCMV.																		2073-4409				NOV	2019	8	11							1346	10.3390/cells8111346							WOS:000502266700044	31671899

Reproducible Derivation and Expansion of Corneal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Therapeutic Applications	TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Purpose: A reproducible protocol for the production of corneal mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (cMSCs) is necessary for potential clinical applications. We aimed to describe successful generation and expansion of cMSCs using an explant method. Methods: Corneoscleral rims of human cadaveric eyes were divided into four pieces and used as explants to allow outgrowth of cMSCs (passage 0, or PO). The cells were subcultured at a 1:10 ratio until passage 5 (P5). The characteristics as well as therapeutic effects of expanded cMSCs were evaluated both in vitro, using a scratch assay, and in vivo using epithelial debridement and chemical injury mouse models. Results: All explants demonstrated outgrowth of cells by 7 days. Although the initial outgrowth included mixed mesenchymal and epithelial cells, by P1 only cMSCs remained. By subculturing each flask at a ratio of 1:10, the potential yield from each cornea was approximately 12 to 16 x 10(10) P5 cells. P5 cMSCs demonstrated the cell surface markers of MSCs. The secretome of P5 cMSCs induced faster closure of wounds in an in vitro scratch assay. Subconjunctival injection of P5 cMSCs in mouse models of mechanical corneal epithelial debridement or ethanol injury led to significantly faster wound healing and decreased inflammation, relative to control. Conclusions: cMSCs can be reproducibly derived from human cadaveric corneas using an explant method and expanded with preservation of characteristics and corneal wound healing effects. Translational Relevance: The results of our study showed that cMSCs produced using this scheme can be potentially used for clinical applications.

Proliferative Potential of Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Human Bone Marrow	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE												We studied the capacity of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from human bone marrow (BM) to long-term passaging, cloning, and re-cloning. Initial multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells and cells after gene labeling were studied. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells were obtained from donors (13-59 years) and cultured for 7 passages. Third generation lentivector was used for delivery of green fluorescent protein marker gene. The procedure of infection revealed reduced proliferative potential of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells from elder donors. Hierarchy of precursor cells differing by their proliferative potential was demonstrated in the culture of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. Three categories of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells were identified: mature cells incapable of proliferation (75.7 +/- 2.4% population) and cells with low and high proliferative potential (17.6 +/- 2.1 and 6.7 +/- 0.3%, respectively). The relative content of these cells insignificantly differed from passage to passage. The efficiency of cloning also remains stable, but re-cloning capacity sharply decreased after passage 3 and completely disappeared in multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells after cryopreservation. Thus, cultured multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells represent a heterogeneous and hierarchically organized population and the characteristics of this population depend of the duration of culturing and age of BM donor. This should be taken into account when using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in clinical practice.

Anti-DKK1 Enhances the Early Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT												Adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) have been previously used for bone repair. However, significant cell heterogeneity exists within the ASC population, which has the potential to result in unreliable bone tissue formation and/or low efficacy. Although the use of cell sorting to lower cell heterogeneity is one method to improve bone formation, this is a technically sophisticated and costly process. In this study, we tried to find a simpler and more deployable solution-blocking antiosteogenic molecule Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) to improve osteogenic differentiation. Human adipose-derived stem cells were derived from = 5 samples of human lipoaspirate. In vitro, anti-DKK1 treatment, but not anti-sclerostin (SOST), promoted ASC osteogenic differentiation, assessed by alizarin red staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Increased canonical Wnt signaling was confirmed after anti-DKK1 treatment. Expression levels ofDKK1peaked during early osteogenic differentiation (day 3). Concordantly, anti-DKK1 supplemented early (day 3 or before), but not later (day 7) during osteogenic differentiation positively regulated osteoblast formation. Finally, anti-DKK1 led to increased transcript abundance of the Wnt inhibitor SOST, potentially representing a compensatory cellular mechanism. In sum, DKK1 represents a targetable "molecular brake" on the osteogenic differentiation of human ASC. Moreover, release of this brake by neutralizing anti-DKK1 antibody treatment at least partially rescues the poor bone-forming efficacy of ASC.

Histological analysis showed that cells of the most vascularized tumorigenic clone, -BD11 had a pericyte-like alpha smooth muscle actin (ASMA+) and CD146+ positive phenotype. Upon serum withdrawal in culture, -BD11 cells formed cord-like structures mimicking capillary morphogenesis. In contrast, cells of the poorly tumorigenic clone, -BC8 did not stain for ASMA, tumours were less vascularized and serum withdrawal in culture led to cell death. By exploring the heterogeneity in hMSC-TERT20 clones we aimed to understand molecular mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells may promote neovascularization. Methodology/Principal Findings: Quantitative qRT-PCR analysis revealed similar mRNA levels for genes encoding the angiogenic cytokines VEGF and Angiopoietin-1 in both clones. However, clone-BD11 produced a denser extracellular matrix that supported stable ex vivo capillary morphogenesis of human endothelial cells and promoted in vivo neovascularization. Proteomic characterization of the -BD11 decellularized matrix identified 50 extracellular angiogenic proteins, including galectin-1. siRNA knock down of galectin-1 expression abrogated the ex vivo interaction between decellularized -BD11 matrix and endothelial cells. More stable shRNA knock down of galectin-1 expression did not prevent -BD11 tumorigenesis, but greatly reduced endothelial migration into -BD11 cell xenografts. Conclusions: Decellularized hMSC matrix had significant angiogenic potential with at least 50 angiogenic cell surface and extracellular proteins, implicated in attracting endothelial cells, their adhesion and activation to form tubular structures. hMSC -BD11 surface galectin-1 expression was required to bring about matrix-endothelial interactions and for xenografted hMSC -BD11 cells to optimally recruit host vasculature.

This is illustrated in breast cancer, where TRAIL is cytotoxic in cell lines of mesenchymal origin but refractory in lines with an epithelial-like phenotype. However, it is now evident that intra-tumour heterogeneity includes a minority subpopulation of tumour-initiating stem/progenitor-like cells (CSCs) that possess mesenchymal characteristics. We hypothesised therefore that TRAIL may target these phenotypically distinct CSC-like cells that are common to most - if not all - breast cancers, thus impacting on the source of malignancy in a much broader range of breast tumour subtypes than previously envisaged. Methods: We used colony formation, tumoursphere, flow cytometry and xenograft tumour initiation assays to observe the TRAIL sensitivity of CSC-like cells in a panel of two mesenchymal-like (TRAIL-sensitive) and four epithelial-like (TRAIL-resistant) breast cancer cell lines. Subcellular levels of the endogenous TRAIL inhibitor, cFLIP, were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. The effect of the subcellular redistribution of cFLIP on TRAIL sensitivity and Wnt signalling was determined using cFLIP localisation mutants and the TOPFlash reporter assay respectively. Results: TRAIL universally suppressed the clonal expansion of stem/progenitors in all six of the breast cancer cell lines tested, irrespective of their phenotype or overall sensitivity to TRAIL. A concomitant reduction in tumour initiation was confirmed in the TRAIL-resistant epithelial cell line, MCF-7, following serial dilution xenotransplantation. Furthermore TRAIL sensitivity of breast CSCs was inversely proportional to the relative cytoplasmic levels of cFLIP while overexpression of cFLIP in the cytosol using subcellular localization mutants of cFLIP protected these cells from cytotoxicity. The accumulation of nuclear cFLIP on the other hand did not influence TRAIL cytotoxicity but instead promoted Wnt-dependent signalling. Conclusion: These data propose a novel role for TRAIL as a selective CSC agent with a broad specificity for both epithelial and mesenchymal breast tumour subtypes. Furthermore we identify a dual role for cFLIP in the maintenance of breast CSC viability, dependent upon its subcellular distribution.

The present study aimed to analyze the role of the MSCs from different tissues, consisting of human bone marrow, adipose and the umbilical cord tissues, and the heterogeneity of tumors in tumor progression. By collecting the culture supernatants of MSCs as MSC-conditioned media (CMs), the present study found that MSC-CM produces no significant effect on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and A549 tumor cells. The migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was enhanced upon incubation with MSC-CM, while that of A549 cells was inhibited. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of insulin receptors (IRs) was upregulated in MSC-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, while in MSC-CM-treated A549 cells, the phosphorylation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (Her3) was downregulated. Taken together, the findings suggest that the phosphorylation of IR and Her3 may contribute to the discrepant effects of MSC-CM on the migration of the 2 cell lines.

We previously reported heterogeneity for clonogenic survival when testing in vitro radiation resistance among single-cell derived clones from a human mesenchymal cancer stem cell model (hMSC). Here we aimed to determine whether this heterogeneity persisted in tumours established from these clones, and whether the response to radiation treatment was principally governed by cell-intrinsic qualities or by factors pertaining to the tumour microenvironment, such as the degree of hypoxia and vascularization. Methods : Immune-deficient female mice were implanted on the backs with cells from one of the clones. The subsequent tumours were subjected to either radiation treatment or had the tumour microenvironment assayed, when they reached 400 mm(3). Radiation was given as a single fraction of 0-15 Gy and the degree of tumour control and time to three times the treatment volume were noted. Tumours used for the microenvironmental assay had intratumoral hypoxia measured by the Eppendorf oxygen electrode and pimonidazole staining, and the extent of vascularization determined by a microvasculature density assay using endothelial-specific staining. Results : All microenvironmental assays indicated a similar degree of hypoxia and vascularization for the selected clones. Nonetheless, the tumours responded differently to radiation treatment since the BB3 clone displayed tumour control at 5, 10 and 15 Gy, whereas tumour control was not seen below 15 Gy with the CE8 clone. Conclusion : For tumours that displayed similar degrees of oxygenation and vascularization, the clone-specific in vitro radiation resistance could predict the in vivo response to radiation treatment. These results favor the hypothesis that intrinsic genetic factors can govern radiation resistance in this cancer stem cell model.

Osteogenic Programming of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Highly Efficient Intracellular Delivery of RUNX2	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being exploited in regenerative medicine due to their tri-lineage differentiation and immunomodulation activity. Currently, there are two major challenges when directing the differentiation of MSCs for therapeutic applications. First, chemical and growth factor strategies to direct osteogenesis in vivo lack specificity for targeted delivery with desired effects. Second, MSC differentiation by gene therapy is difficult as transfection with existing approaches is clinically impractical (viral transfection) or have low efficacy (lipid-mediated transfection). These challenges can be avoided by directly delivering nonvirally derived recombinant protein transcription factors with the glycosaminoglycan-binding enhanced transduction (GET) delivery system (P21 and 8R peptides). We used the osteogenic master regulator, RUNX2 as a programming factor due to its stage-specific role in osteochondral differentiation pathways. Herein, we engineered GET-fusion proteins and compared sequential osteogenic changes in MSCs, induced by exposure to GET fusion proteins or conventional stimulation methods (dexamethasone and Bone morphogenetic protein 2). By assessing loss of stem cell-surface markers, upregulation of osteogenic genes and matrix mineralization, we demonstrate that GET-RUNX2 efficiently transduces MSCs and triggers osteogenesis by enhancing target gene expression directly. The high transduction efficiency of GET system holds great promise for stem cell therapies by allowing reproducible transcriptional control in stem cells, potentially bypassing problems observed with high-concentration growth-factor or pleiotropic steroid therapies.

In addition, they are known to participate in niche formation for hematopoietic stem cells and to display immunomodulatory properties. Conventionally, these cells are functionally isolated from tissue based on their capacity to adhere to the surface of culture flasks. This isolation procedure is hampered by the unpredictable influence of secreted molecules, the interactions between cocultured hematopoietic and other unrelated cells, and by the arbitrarily selected removal time of nonadherent cells before the expansion of MSCs. Finally, functionally isolated cells do not provide biological information about the starting population. To circumvent these limitations, several strategies have been developed to facilitate the prospective isolation of MSCs based on the selective expression, or absence, of surface markers. In this report, we summarize the most frequently used markers and introduce new targets for antibody-based isolation procedures of primary bone marrow- and amnion-derived MSCs.

In hematopoietic progenitor populations, this heterogeneity has been shown to regenerate within days from isolated subpopulations defined by high or low marker expression. This kind of plasticity has been suggested to be a fundamental feature of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well. Here, we study MSC plasticity on the level of individual cells applying a multi-scale computer model that is based on the concept of noise-driven stem cell differentiation. Results: By simulation studies, we provide detailed insight into the kinetics of MSC organisation. Monitoring the fates of individual cells in high and low oxygen culture, we calculated the average transition times of individual cells into stem cell and differentiated states. We predict that at low oxygen the heterogeneity of a MSC population with respect to differentiation regenerates from any selected subpopulation in about two days. At high oxygen, regeneration becomes substantially slowed down. Simulation results on the composition of the functional stem cell pool of MSC populations suggest that most of the cells that constitute this pool originate from more differentiated cells. Conclusions: Individual cell-based models are well-suited to provide quantitative predictions on essential features of the spatio-temporal organisation of MSC in vitro. Our predictions on MSC plasticity and its dependence on the environment motivate a number of in vitro experiments for validation. They may contribute to a better understanding of MSC organisation in vitro, including features of clonal expansion, environmental adaptation and stem cell ageing.																	1752-0509					MAY 27	2010	4								73	10.1186/1752-0509-4-73							WOS:000279942900002	20507570

Heterogeneity of Stemlike Circulating Tumor Cells in Invasive Breast Cancer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												The presence of stem and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) features in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) determines their invasiveness, adaptability to the microenvironment, and resistance to proapoptotic signals and chemotherapy. It also allows them to fulfil the role of metastatic "seeds". We evaluated the heterogeneity of stem CTCs by their CD44, ALDH1, and CD133 expression depending on N-cadherin expression in breast-cancer patients. A total of 38 female patients were selected for this study. CTC phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry before any type of treatment. Multiplex immunofluorescence was used for the evaluation of tumor-cell heterogeneity in primary lesions. In patients who had CD44-CD24- CTCs, a subset of cells with the expression of other stem-cell markers (CD133 and ALDH1) were detected. Expression of CD133 and/or ALDH1 may be associated with expression of N-cadherin: all populations of N-cadherin+ CTCs demonstrate stem features; in the absence of N-cadherin expression, true nonstem (CD44-CD24-CD133-ALDH1-) cells are found. The heterogeneity of stem marker expression in CTCs was observed regardless of N-cadherin expression. In our study, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) receptor expression in CTCs did not depend on stemlike traits, but was instead associated with N-cadherin expression. Subpopulations of tumor cells, detected both in tumors and blood, were identified. Breast cancer was characterized by pronounced interpersonal and intrapersonal heterogeneity of CTCs by the presence and combination of various stem features and N-cadherin expression. To complete the characterization of stemlike features of CTCs, we suggest the simultaneous use of the three stem markers.

Standard treatment options such as radiation and chemotherapy have proven to be onlymarginally effective in treating GBM because of its invasive nature. Therefore, extensive efforts have been put forth to develop tumor-tropic stem cells as viable therapeutic vehicles with potential to treat even the most invasive tumor cells that are harbored within areas of normal brain. To this end, we discovered a newly described NG2-expressing cell that we isolated from a distinct pericyte subtype found abundantly in cultures derived from peripheral muscle. In this work, we show the translational significance of these peripherally derived neural-like stem cells (NLSC) and their potential tomigrate toward tumors and act as therapeutic carriers. We demonstrate that these NLSCs exhibit in vitro and in vivo GBM tropism. Furthermore, NLSCs did not promote angiogenesis or transform into tumor-associated stromal cells, which are concerns raised when using other common stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and induced neural stem cells, as therapeutic carriers. We also demonstrate the potential of NLSCs to express a prototype therapeutic, tumor necrosis factor a-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and kill GBM cells in vitro. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our newly characterized NLSC against GBM.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a key component of this BM niche, are affected in several ways with unfavorable consequences on hematopoietic stem cells favoring leukemic cells. These alterations in MSC during B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have not been fully studied. In this work, we have compared the modifications that occur in an in vitro leukemic niche (LN) with those observed in MSC isolated from B-ALL patients. MSC in this LN niche showed features of a senescence process, i.e., altered morphology, increased senescence-associated beta-Galactosidase (SA-beta GAL) activity, and upregulation of p53 and p21 (without p16 expression), cell-cycle arrest, reduced clonogenicity, and some moderated changes in stemness properties. Importantly, almost all of these features were found in MSC isolated from B-ALL patients. These alterations rendered B-ALL cells susceptible to the chemotherapeutic agent dexamethasone. The senescent process seems to be transient since when leukemic cells are removed, normal MSC morphology is re-established, SA-beta GAL expression is diminished, and MSC are capable of re-entering cell cycle. In addition, few cells showed low gamma H2AX phosphorylation that was reduced to basal levels upon cultivation. The reversibility of the senescent process in MSC must impinge important biological and clinical significance depending on cell interactions in the bone marrow at different stages of disease progression in B-ALL.

Several types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been characterized in the oral cavity, and those derived from the periodontal ligament (PDL) first isolated by our group in 2005, can be expanded in a xeno-free medium preserving morphological features and markers associated with pluripotency. These postnatal MSCs can be easily recovered by noninvasive procedures and cultured. This could facilitate the use of adult stem cells in human clinical regeneration therapy. In this review we summarize the results of our studies describing morphofunctional features, surface markers, and multilineage differentiation capacity in vitro of PDL MSCs obtained in our laboratories. In vivo characterization of PDL stem cell (PDLSC) location and heterogeneity are still lacking. However, we describe studies exploring the potential use of PDLSC to treat both periodontal diseases and regeneration of other tissues. These MSCs may have an advantage in possessing also angiogenetic, immunoregulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties. The secretome of such cells contains several interesting molecules mimicking the effects of the producer cells. We describe some recent studies from our group on the use of conditioned medium from PDL MSCs, and purified extracellular vesicles therein contained, in animal models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and their potential application to human disease.

MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS PRODUCE FUNCTIONAL CARTILAGE MATRIX IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL CULTURE IN REGIONS OF OPTIMAL NUTRIENT SUPPLY	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising cell source for the treatment of musculoskeletal disease. However, MSC chondrogenesis in 3D culture generates constructs whose macroscopic (bulk) mechanical properties are inferior to constructs formed with chondrocytes. To investigate where and why these deficits in functionality arise, we assessed the local (microscopic) properties of cell-laden hydrogel constructs. Both chondrocyte- and MSC-laden constructs showed pronounced depth dependency, with similar to 3.5 and similar to 11.5 fold decreases in modulus from the surface to central regions, respectively. Importantly, in the surface region, properties were similar, suggesting that MSCs can produce matrix of mechanical equivalence to chondrocytes, but only in conditions of maximal nutrient support. Dynamic culture on an orbital shaker (which enhances diffusion) attenuated depth-dependent disparities in mechanics and improved the bulk properties compared to free swelling conditions (225 to 438 kPa for chondrocytes, 122 to 362 kPa for MSCs). However, properties in MSC-based constructs remained significantly lower due to persistent mechanical deficits in central regions. MSC viability in these central regions decreased markedly, with these changes apparent as early as day 21, while chondrocyte viability remained high. These findings suggest that, under optimal nutrient conditions, MSCs can undergo chondrogenesis and form functional tissue on par with that of the native tissue cell type. However, the lack of viability and matrix production in central regions suggests that chondrogenic MSCs do not yet fully recapitulate the advanced phenotype of the chondrocyte, a cell that is optimized to survive (and thrive) in a mechanically challenging and nutrient-poor environment.

Comparative Evaluation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells of Fetal (Wharton's Jelly) and Adult (Adipose Tissue) Origin during Prolonged In Vitro Expansion: Considerations for Cytotherapy	STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are somatic cells with a dual capacity for self-renewal and differentiation, and diverse therapeutic applicability, both experimentally and in the clinic. These cells can be isolated from various human tissues that may differ anatomically or developmentally with relative ease. Heterogeneity due to biological origin or in vitro manipulation is, nevertheless, considerable and may equate to differences in qualitative and quantitative characteristics which can prove crucial for successful therapeutic use. With this in mind, in the present study we have evaluated the proliferation kinetics and phenotypic characteristics of MSCs derived from two abundant sources, that is, fetal umbilical cord matrix (Wharton's jelly) and adult adipose tissue (termed WJSC and ADSC, resp.) during prolonged in vitro expansion, a process necessary for obtaining cell numbers sufficient for clinical application. Our results show that WJSC are derived with relatively high efficiency and bear a substantially increased proliferation capacity whilst largely sustaining the expression of typical immunophenotypic markers, whereas ADSC exhibit a reduced proliferation potential showing typical signs of senescence at an early stage. By combining kinetic with phenotypic data we identify culture thresholds up to which both cell types maintain their stem properties, and we discuss the practical implications of their differences.																	1687-966X	1687-9678					2013	2013								246134	10.1155/2013/246134							WOS:000323840200001	23533440

This study aimed to establish a protocol for enumeration and phenotypic characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by ImageStreamX MK II (AMNIS) imaging flow cytometry and to characterize the expression of epithelial, mesenchymal, and stem cell markers in CTCs. Methods: The study used the FaDu cell line at different passages, cisplatin-resistant (FaDu CDDP-R), and irradiation-resistant (FaDu IR-R) subclones, as well as blood samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients for CTC detection (n = 5). Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by incubation in 0.3% Triton X-100. The cell suspensions were stained with 1:100 EpCAM AF-488, 1:50 CD45 AF-647, 1:50 Vimentin AF-555, and 1:50 ALDH1A AF-594 antibodies. Results: There were significant differences in EpCAM expression levels between FaDu at late passage and FaDu CDDP-R subclones, as well as between FaDu at late passage compared with FaDu IR-R. Furthermore, CTCs were successfully detected in five patients' samples with various CTC subpopulations. Conclusions: Intratumor heterogeneity in CTC phenotypes existed in CRC and HNSCC. Furthermore, three main subpopulations of CTCs were detected. Our findings strongly support future phenotypic studies of CTCs.																	2356-3664	2356-3656				APR	2019	23	1					53	63		10.7454/msk.v23i1.10149							WOS:000467042700009

Previous studies have focused on the differentiation of stem cells into a defined lineage using nanotopographies, but they have rarely considered the homogeneity of cell populations produced. We examined the impact of two types of substrates (i.e. nanogrooves and nanopillars made by soft lithography) on the surface-induced differentiation of human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAM-MSCs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) without the use of additional chemical induction medium components. Cell morphology and proliferation were analysed at day 1 and day 3. Gene expression was analysed at day 14 for hAM-MSCs and at day 7 for mESC-derived embryoid bodies (mEBs) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The substrates with nanogrooves had a noticeable effect on cell alignment in a depth dependent manner with both cell types showing strong alignment along the deep grooves. On the other hand, the nanopillar substrates showed inhibition of cell spreading for both cell types. The nanogrooves showed inhibition of hAM-MSC growth but enhanced mEB proliferation, especially on the deeper grooves. The nanopillars did not significantly affect hAM-MSC growth, but can modulate mEB growth depending on the pillar density, indicating that mEBs are more sensitive to nanotopographies in terms of proliferation, while hAM-MSCs are only sensitive to specific structures and sizes. Genes associated with bone, cartilage, and fat were investigated for hAM-MSCs, whereas genes of the endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm, and pluripotency were investigated for mEBs. In general, gene expression for hAM-MSCs was not enhanced significantly by the nanotopographies compared to the flat control. On the other hand, genes of bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver were up-regulated on both nanopillars and nanogrooves, especially OP65 (ordered pillars with 65% density) and SG40 (shallow grooves with 40 nm depth) in a feature size dependent manner. We found that a small portion of mEBs was composed of cardiac-like beating cells (i. e. GFP-NKX2.5 positive) and a bone cell marker (i. e. OCN) indicating a heterogeneous cell population being generated on those types of surfaces. This work highlights the importance of nanotopographies in stem cell differentiation and how studying multiple properties of the substrate and cells is needed as we strive to generate homogeneous and mature cell populations using biomaterials.				wang, peng-yuan/F-5589-2015	wang, peng-yuan/0000-0001-7965-2914; Kingshott, Peter/0000-0001-5882-5804; Sumer, Huseyin/0000-0001-9413-5579; Wong, Raymond Ching-Bong/0000-0002-8092-9455												2050-750X	2050-7518				OCT 21	2017	5	39					7927	7938		10.1039/c7tb01878a							WOS:000412824200002	32264194					
J	Cabarcas, SM; Mathews, LA; Farrar, WL				Cabarcas, Stephanie M.; Mathews, Lesley A.; Farrar, William L.			The cancer stem cell niche-there goes the neighborhood?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER												The niche is the environment in which stem cells reside and is responsible for the maintenance of unique stem cell properties such as self-renewal and an undifferentiated state. The heterogeneous populations which constitute a niche include both stem cells and surrounding differentiated cells. This network of heterogeneity is responsible for the control of the necessary pathways that function in determining stem cell fate. The concept that cancer stem cells, a subpopulation of cells responsible for tumor initiation and formation, reside in their own unique niche is quickly evolving and it is of importance to understand and identify the processes occurring within this environment. The necessary intrinsic pathways that are utilized by this cancer stem cell population to maintain both self-renewal and the ability to differentiate are believed to be a result of the environment where cancer stem cells reside. The ability of a specific cancer stem cell niche to provide the environment in which this population can flourish is a critical aspect of cancer biology that mandates intense investigation. This review focuses on current evidence demonstrating that homeostatic processes such as inflammation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, hypoxia and angiogenesis contribute to the maintenance and control of cancer stem cell fate by providing the appropriate signals within the microenvironment. It is necessary to understand the key processes occurring within this highly specialized cancer stem cell niche to identify potential therapeutic targets that can serve as the basis for development of more effective anticancer treatments.																	0020-7136	1097-0215				NOV 15	2011	129	10					2315	2327		10.1002/ijc.26312							WOS:000295231000003	21792897

MSCs exist in several tissues such as the bone marrow, adipose, muscle, cartilage, and tendon. This differentiation potential makes MSCs candidates for cell-based therapeutic strategies for mesenchymal tissue injuries. MSCs can be prepared from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and adipose (AD-MSCs); however, these MSCs exhibit senescence-associated growth arrest and display inevitable heterogeneity. We established several AD-MSC cell lines from a p53-knockout (KO) mouse. These cell lines were immortalized, but no cell lines grew anchorage-independently, suggesting that they are not cancerous. They differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes by treatment with certain stimuli. Moreover, following injection into the tail vein, the cells migrated into the wounded region of the liver and differentiated into hepatocytes. We succeeded in establishing several AD-MSC clonal cell lines that maintain the tissue-specific markers and characteristics of the developmental phase. These clonal cell lines will serve as important tools to study the mechanism of differentiation of MSCs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is not known which of the stem-like cancer cells are generated by these phenotype transitions. We studied the EMT-inducing roles of SNAILs (the key inducers for the onset of EMT) in selected cancer cells (lung cancer cell line with relatively stable genome), in order to provide more implications for the investigation of EMT-related phenotype transitions in cancer. However, SNAILs fail to induce completed EMT. In addition, we proved that Snail accelerates the early G1 phase whereas Slug accelerates the late G1 phase. Blocking G1 phase is one of the basic conditions for the onset of EMT-related phenotype transitions (e.g., metastasis, acquring sternness). The discovery of this unexpected phenomenon (promoting G1 phase) typically reveals the heterogeneity of cancer cells. The onset of EMT-related phenotype transitions in cancer needs not only the induction and activation of SNAILs, but also some particular heredity alterations (genetic or epigenetic alterations, which cause heterogeneity). The new connection between heredity alteration (heterogeneity) and phenotype transition suggests a novel treatment strategy, the heredity alteration-directed specific target therapy. Further investigations need to be conducted to study the relevant heredity alterations.

Despite these advantages, heterogeneity in functional potential and limited proliferation capacity of MPCs, as well as the lack of suitable markers for product potency, hamper the development of large-scale manufacturing processes of MPCs. Therefore, there is a sustained need to develop highly proliferative and standardized MPCs in vitro and find suitable functional markers for measuring product potency. In this study, three lines of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived MPCs with high proliferative ability were established and compared with bone-marrow-derived MPCs using proliferation assays and microarrays. A total of six genes were significantly overexpressed (>10-fold) in the highest proliferative MPC line (CHA-hNT5-MPCs) and validated by qRT-PCR. However, only two of the genes (MYOCD and ODZ2) demonstrated a significant correlation with MPC senescence in vitro. Our study provides new gene markers for predicting replicative senescence and the available quantity of MPCs but may also help to guide the development of new standard criteria for manufacturing.

Quantitative high-content imaging technology allows identification of morphological markers at a single cell resolution that are determinant for cellular functions. We determined the morphological characteristics of cultured primary hBM-MSCs and examined their predictive value for hBM-MSC functionality. BM-MSCs were isolated from 56 donors and characterized for their proliferative and differentiation potential. We correlated these data with cellular and nuclear morphological features determined by Operetta; a high-content imaging system. Cell area, cell- and nucleus geometry of cultured hBM-MSCs exhibited significant correlation with expression of hBM-MSC membrane markers: ALP, CD146, CD271. Proliferation capacity correlated negatively with cell and nucleus area and positively with cytoskeleton texture features. In addition, in vitro differentiation to osteoblasts as well as in vivo heterotopic bone formation was associated with decreased ratio of nucleus width to length. Multivariable analysis applying a stability selection procedure identified nuclear geometry and texture as predictors for hBM-MSCs differentiation potential to osteoblasts or adipocytes. Our data demonstrate that by employing a limited number of cell morphological characteristics, it is possible to predict the functional phenotype of cultured hBM-MSCs and thus can be used as a screening test for "quality" of hBM-MSCs prior their use in clinical protocols.

We previously found that human fetal lung is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Here we characterize and analyze the frequency and function of MSC in other second-trimester fetal tissues. Design and Methods. Single cell suspensions of fetal bone marrow (BM), liver, lung, and spleen were made and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of CD90, CD105, CD166, SH3, SH4, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD34 and CD45. We assessed the frequency of MSC by limiting dilution assay. Results. The frequency of MSC in BM was significantly higher than in liver, lung, and spleen (p < 0.05). On primary non-expanded cells from fetal liver, lung and spleen the number of cells positive for mesenchymal markers was significantly higher within the CD34 positive population than within the CD34 negative population. The phenotype of the culture-expanded MSC was similar for all fetal tissues, i.e. CD90, CD105, CD166, SH3, SH4 and HLA-ABC positive and CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR negative. Culture-expanded cells from all tissues were able to differentiate along adipogenic and osteogenic pathways. However, adipogenic differentiation was less in MSC derived from spleen, and osteogenic differentiation was reduced in liver-derived MSC (p < 0.05). Interpretation and Conclusions. Our results indicate that culture-expanded MSC derived from second-trimester fetal tissues, although phenotypically similar, exhibit heterogeneity in differentiating potential. We speculate that these differences may be relevant for the clinical application of MSC.																	0390-6078					AUG	2003	88	8					845	852									WOS:000185131800002	12935972

Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stromal cells inhibit cell damage, tissue damage and improve peripheral blood flow following hindlimb ischemic injury in mice	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Existing treatments have limited success in modifying the course of peripheral artery disease, which may eventually lead to limb-threatening ulcers and amputation. Cellular therapies have the potential to provide a new treatment option for this condition, but isolation of cells by conventional means has limitations with respect to reproducibility and scalability. Methods. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into precursor cells known as mesenchymoangioblasts (MCAs) and subsequently into mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Hindlimb ischemia in mice was created by ligating both the iliac and femoral arteries of one hindlimb. Immediately after surgery, each animal received intramuscular injections of 5 x 10(6) cells or media in the ischemic limb. Toe necrosis was assessed visually, and hindlimb blood flow was measured by laser Doppler using a set region of interest (ROI) and by tracing the entire foot. Myofiber heterogeneity, nuclear centralization, fatty degeneration, fibrosis and capillary angiogenesis in the gastrocnemius muscle were assessed histologically. Results. Blood flow in the MCA-derived MSC-treated animals was higher at each day (P < 0.006), and these mice recovered faster than control animals (3.6 vs. 2.5 for set ROI; 7.5 vs. 4:1 foot tracing; slope; P < 0.001). There was significantly less myofiber heterogeneity, nuclear centralization, fatty degeneration and fibrosis in MCA-derived MSC-treated animals, indicating less tissue damage. Discussion. MCA-derived MSCs improved limb blood flow, reduced necrosis and maintained muscle mass and gross muscle appearance. We conclude that MCA-derived MSCs have a significant and protective effect against ischemic insults.

However, donor cell heterogeneity and inconsistent protocols for transplantation have led to varied outcomes in clinical trials. We previously showed that genetically-modifying MSCs to express erythropoietin (MSCEPO) improved its regenerative capabilities in vitro. Hence, in this study, we sought to prove its potential in vivo by transplanting MSCsEPO in a rat retinal degeneration model and analyzing its retinal transcriptome using RNA-Seq. Firstly, MSCsEPO were cultured and expanded before being intravitreally transplanted into the sodium iodate-induced model. After the procedure, electroretinography (ERG) was performed bi-weekly for 30 days. Histological analyses were performed after the ERG assessment. The retina was then harvested for RNA extraction. After mRNA-enrichment and library preparation, paired-end RNA-Seq was performed. Salmon and DESeq2 were used to process the output files. The generated dataset was then analyzed using over-representation (ORA), functional enrichment (GSEA), and pathway topology analysis tools (SPIA) to identify enrichment of key pathways in the experimental groups. The results showed that the MSCEPO-treated group had detectable ERG waves (P <0.05), which were indicative of successful phototransduction. The stem cells were also successfully detected by immunohistochemistry 30 days after intravitreal transplantation. An initial over-representation analysis revealed a snapshot of immune-related pathways in all the groups but was mainly overexpressed in the MSC group. A subsequent GSEA and SPIA analysis later revealed enrichment in a large number of biological processes including phototransduction, regeneration, and cell death (P-adj <0.05). Based on these pathways, a set of pro-survival gene expressions were extracted and tabulated. This study provided an in-depth transcriptomic analysis on the MSCEPO-treated retinal degeneration model as well as a profile of pro-survival genes that can be used as candidates for further genetic enhancement studies on stem cells.

J	Kim, HY; Bhang, SH				Kim, Han Young; Bhang, Suk Ho			Stem Cell-Engineered Nanovesicles Exert Proangiogenic and Neuroprotective Effects	MATERIALS												As a tissue regeneration strategy, the utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has drawn considerable attention. Comprehensive research using MSCs has led to significant preclinical or clinical outcomes; however, improving the survival rate, engraftment efficacy, and immunogenicity of implanted MSCs remains challenging. Although MSC-derived exosomes were recently introduced and reported to have great potential to replace conventional MSC-based therapeutics, the poor production yield and heterogeneity of exosomes are critical hurdles for their further applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of exosome-mimetic MSC-engineered nanovesicles (MSC-NVs) by subjecting cells to serial extrusion through filters. The fabricated MSC-NVs exhibit a hydrodynamic size of similar to 120 nm, which is considerably smaller than the size of MSCs (similar to 30 mu m). MSC-NVs contain both MSC markers and exosome markers. Importantly, various therapeutic growth factors originating from parent MSCs are encapsulated in the MSC-NVs. The MSC-NVs exerted various therapeutic effects comparable to those of MSCs. They also significantly induced the angiogenesis of endothelial cells and showed neuroprotective effects in damaged neuronal cells. The results collectively demonstrate that the fabricated MSC-NVs can serve as a nanosized therapeutic agent for tissue regeneration.

We focused on amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) as a cell source because, unlike induced pluripotent stem cells, they are cost-effective and non-tumorigenic. The utilization of AECs in regenerative medicine, however, is in its infancy. A general profile for AECs has not been comprehensively analyzed. Moreover, no hepatic differentiation protocol for AECs has yet been established. To this end, we independently compiled human AEC libraries, purified amniotic stem cells (ASCs), and co-cultured them with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) in a 3D system which induces functional hepatic organoids. AIM To characterize AECs and generate functional hepatic organoids from ASCs and other somatic stem cells METHODS AECs, MSCs, and HUVECs were isolated from the placentae and umbilical cords of cesarean section patients. Amnion and primary AEC sternness characteristics and heterogeneity were analyzed by immunocytochemistry, Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, and flow cytometry. An adherent AEC subpopulation was selected and evaluated for ASC purification quality by a colony formation assay. AEC transcriptomes were compared with those for other hepatocytes cell sources by bioinformatics. The 2D and 3D culture were compared by relative gene expression using several differentiation protocols. ASCs, MSCs, and HUVECs were combined in a 3D co-culture system to generate hepatic organoids whose structure was compared with a 3D AEC sphere and whose function was elucidated by immunofluorescence imaging, periodic acid Schiff, and an indocyanine green (ICG) test. RESULTS AECs have certain sternness markers such as EPCAM, SSEA4, and E-cadherin. One AEC subpopulation was also either positive for AP staining or expressed the TRA -1-60 and TRA-1-81 sternness markers. Moreover, it could form colonies and its frequency was enhanced ten-fold in the adherent subpopulation after selective primary passage. Bioinformatics analysis of ribose nucleic acid sequencing revealed that the total AEC gene expression was distant from those of pluripotent stem cells and hepatocytes but some gene expression overlapped among these cells. TJP1, associated with epidermal growth factor receptor, and MET, associated with hepatocyte growth factor receptor, were upregulated and may be important for hepatic differentiation. In conventional flat culture, the cells turned unviable and did not readily differentiate into hepatocytes. In 3D culture, however, hepatic gene expression of the. AEC sphere was elevated even under a two-step differentiation protocol. Furthermore, the organoids derived from the MSC and HUVEC co-culture showed 3D structure with polarity, hepatic-like glycogen storage, and ICG absorption/elimination. CONCLUSION Human amniotic epithelial cells are heterogeneous and certain subpopulations have high sternness. Under a 3D co-culture system, functional hepatic organoids were generated in a multicellular microenvironment.

The best characterized BM microenvironment is the niche that regulates hematopoietic stem cells. Efforts from many different laboratories have revealed that the niche is mainly perivascular and that blood vessels and perivascular stromal cells are the key components.

Isolation of adipose and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells using CD29 and CD90 modifies their capacity for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING												Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from rats are frequently used for tissue engineering research. However, considerable differences have been identified between rat mesenchymal stem cells and those derived from humans, and no defined panel of markers currently exists for the isolation of these cells. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of cell sorting for CD29(+)/CD90(+) cells from rat adipose and bone marrow tissues on their differentiation and expression of stem cell-associated genes. Flow cytometry showed 66% and 78% CD29(+)/CD90(+) positivity within passage 1 of adipose and bone marrow cultures, respectively. CD29(+)/CD90(+) cells showed a reduction in both osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation when compared with unsorted cells, as determined by alizarin red and Oil Red-O staining, respectively. These findings could not entirely be explained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting-induced cell injury as sort recovery was only modestly affected in adipose-derived cells. Maintaining cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer did not affect adipose-derived cell viability, but a significant (p < 0.05) reduction was found in bone marrow-derived cell viability. Additionally, CD29(+)/CD90(+) selection was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of Lin28, Sox2, Nanog and CD73 in adipose-derived cell cultures, whereas differences in stem cell-associated gene expression were not observed in sorted bone marrow-derived cell cultures. In summary, this study demonstrated that fluorescence-activated cell sorting had differential effects on adipose-derived cells and bone marrow-derived cells, and both CD29(+)/CD90(+) cells displayed a significantly reduced capacity for osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation. In conclusion, we identify that maintaining heterogeneity within the mesenchymal stem cell population may be important for optimal differentiation.

Profiling stem cell states in three-dimensional biomaterial niches using high content image informatics	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA												A predictive framework for the evolution of stem cell biology in 3-D is currently lacking. In this study we propose deep image informatics of the nuclear biology of stem cells to elucidate how 3-D biomaterials steer stem cell lineage phenotypes. The approach is based on high content imaging informatics to capture minute variations in the 3-D spatial organization of splicing factor SC-35 in the nucleoplasm as a marker to classify emergent cell phenotypes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The cells were cultured in varied 3-D culture systems including hydrogels, electrospun mats and salt leached scaffolds. The approach encompasses high resolution 3-D imaging of SC-35 domains and high content image analysis (HCIA) to compute quantitative 3-D nuclear metrics for SC-35 organization in single cells in concert with machine learning approaches to construct a predictive cell-state classification model. Our findings indicate that hMSCs cultured in collagen hydrogels and induced to differentiate into osteogenic or adipogenic lineages could be classified into the three lineages (stem, adipogenic, osteogenic) with >= 80% precision and sensitivity, within 72 h. Using this framework, the augmentation of osteogenesis by scaffold design exerted by porogen leached scaffolds was also profiled within 72 h with similar to 80% high sensitivity. Furthermore, by employing 3-D SC-35 organizational metrics, differential osteogenesis induced by novel electrospun fibrous polymer mats incorporating decellularized matrix could also be elucidated and predictably modeled at just 3 days with high precision. We demonstrate that 3-D SC-35 organizational metrics can be applied to model the stem cell state in 3-D scaffolds. We propose that this methodology can robustly discern minute changes in stem cell states within complex 3-D architectures and map single cell biological readouts that are critical to assessing population level cell heterogeneity. Statement of Significance The sustained development and validation of bioactive materials relies on technologies that can sensitively discern cell response dynamics to biomaterials, while capturing cell-to-cell heterogeneity and preserving cellular native phenotypes. In this study, we illustrate the application of a novel high content image informatics platform to classify emergent human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) phenotypes in a diverse range of 3-D biomaterial scaffolds with high sensitivity and precision, and track cell responses to varied external stimuli. A major in silico innovation is the proposed image profiling technology based on unique three dimensional textural signatures of a mechanoreporter protein within the nuclei of stem cells cultured in 3-D scaffolds. This technology will accelerate the pace of high-fidelity biomaterial screening. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

STEM CELLS IN PROSTATE CANCER	ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA												Tumors constitute complex ecosystems with multiple interactions among neoplastic cells displaying various phenotypes and functions and where the tumoral niche is built with an active participation of the host environment that also impacts the malignant progression of the tumor cells. Irrespective of the cell of origin of prostate adenocarcinoma, mounting evidences support the existence of a hierarchy within neoplastic prostate cells that contributes to the heterogeneity of these tumors. At the origin of this hierarchy are small populations of tumor cells with high self-renewal potential and also capable of generating progeny tumor cells that lose self-renewal properties as they acquire more differentiated phenotypes. These cancer stem cells (CSC) depend on active gene networks that confer them with their self-renewal capacity through symmetrical divisions whereas they can also undergo asymmetrical division and differentiation either as stochastic events or in response to environmental cues. Although new experimental evidences indicate that this is can be a reversible process, thus blurring the distinction between CSCs and non-CSCs, the former are considered as the drivers of tumor growth and evolution, and thus a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Of particular importance in prostate cancer, CSCs may constitute the repository population of androgen-insensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells responsible for castration-resistant and chemotherapy-insensitive tumors, thus their identification and quantification in primary and metastatic neoplasms could play important roles in the management of this disease.

However, one disadvantage that limit their clinical use is their heterogeneity. In the last decades a great effort was made to select BMSC subpopulations based on cell surface markers, however there is still no general consensus on which markers to use to obtain the best BMSCs for tissue regeneration. Looking for alternatives we decided to focus on a probe-based method to detect intracellular mRNA in living cells, the SmartFlare technology. This technology does not require fixation of the cells and allows us to sort living cells based on gene expression into functionally different populations. However, since the technology is available it is debated whether the probes specifically recognize their target mRNAs. We validated the TWIST1 probe and demonstrated that it specifically recognizes TWIST1 in BMSCs. However, differences in probe concentration, incubation time and cellular uptake can strongly influence signal specificity. In addition we found that TWIST1(high) expressing cells have an increased expansion rate compared to TWIST1(low) expressing cells derived from the same initial population of BMSCs. The SmartFlare probes recognize their target gene, however for each probe and cell type validation of the protocol is necessary.

Functional Heterogeneity of Protein Kinase A Activation in Multipotent Stromal Cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Multipotent stromal cells (MSC) demonstrate remarkable functional heterogeneity; however, its molecular mechanisms remain largely obscure. In this study, we explored MSC response to hormones, which activate Gs-protein / cyclic AMP (cAMP) / protein kinase A (PKA) dependent signaling, at the single cell level using genetically encoded biosensor PKA-Spark. For the first time, we demonstrated that about half of cultured MSCs are not able to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway, possibly due to the limited availability of adenylyl cyclases. Using this approach, we showed that MSC subpopulations responding to various hormones largely overlapped, and the share of responding cells did not exceed 40%. Using clonal analysis, we showed that signaling heterogeneity of MSC could be formed de novo within 2 weeks.

Methods: AF-MSCs were isolated from human amniotic fluid obtained from 17-37 weeks gestation. Lung differentiation was induced on Matrigel or on de-cellularized rat lungs intra-tracheally injected with AF-MSCs by culturing with a modification of small airway growth medium (mSAGM) lacking retinoic acid (RA) and triodothyronine (T3) with addition of fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10). Cells and scaffolds were characterized by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR for markers of viability, proliferation, and lung distal airway differentiation (TTF-1(+) and SPC+) in the absence of markers of brain (TuJ1(-)) and thyroid (Pax8(-)). Results: After culture in mSAGM on either Matrigel or lung scaffolds, there were TTF-1(+)/TuJ1(-)/Pax8(-) cells, indicating a lung precursor phenotype. In addition, SPC+ cells also evolved suggesting a more mature lung phenotype. Conclusions: We demonstrate that mid-to late-trimester AF-MSCs can be induced to develop into lung precursor cells when cultured on the appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM), making them a viable source for use in cell therapy or development of an ex vivo tissue engineered lung.

Here, we applied droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to acquire transcriptional profiles of 36 619 single cells isolated from seven patients. Single cell transcriptional profiles matched well with the pathological basal/luminal subtypes. Notably, in T1 tumors diagnosed as luminal subtype, basal cells displayed characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mainly located at the tumor-stromal interface as well as micrometastases in the lamina propria. In one T3 tumor, muscle-invasive tumor showed significantly higher expression of cancer stem cell markers SOX9 and SOX2 than the primary tumor. We additionally analyzed communications between tumor cells and demonstrated its relevance to basal/luminal phenotypes. Overall, our single-cell study provides a deeper insight into the tumor cell heterogeneity associated with bladder cancer progression.

The THz effect depends on irradiation parameters such as the duration and type of THz source, and on the degree of stem cell differentiation. Our microarray survey and RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that prolonged broadband THz irradiation drives mMSCs toward differentiation, while 2-hour irradiation (regardless of THz sources) affects genes transcriptionally active in pluripotent stem cells. The strictly controlled experimental environment indicates minimal temperature changes and the absence of any discernable response to heat shock and cellular stress genes imply a non-thermal response. Computer simulations of the core promoters of two pluripotency markers reveal association between gene upregulation and propensity for DNA breathing. We propose that THz radiation has potential for non-contact control of cellular gene expression.

However, the underlying mechanisms of stem cell fate specification are unclear. Chirality is one of the most crucial factors that affects stem cell development and is implicated in asymmetrical cell morphology formation; however, its function in heterogeneous cell fate determination remains elusive. In this study, it is reported that the chirality of a constructed 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) differentiates mesenchymal stem cells to diverse lineages of osteogenic and adipogenic cells by providing primary heterogeneity. Molecular analysis shows that left-handed chirality of the ECM enhances the clustering of the mechanosensor Itg alpha 5, while right-handed chirality decreases this effect. These differential adhesion patterns further activate distinct mechanotransduction events involving the contractile state, focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 cascades, and yes-associated protein/runt-related transcription factor 2 nuclear translocation, which direct heterogeneous differentiation. Moreover, theoretical modeling demonstrates that diverse chirality mechanosensing is initiated by biphasic modes of fibronectin tethering. The findings of chirality-dependent lineage specification of stem cells provide potential strategies for the biogenesis of organisms and regenerative therapies.				, 许永傲/AAC-2581-2019; Jiang, Lei/B-1066-2011; Wang, Shutao/AAH-2219-2019	Wang, Zheng/0000-0002-0621-3678												0935-9648	1521-4095				APR 19	2019	31	16							1900582	10.1002/adma.201900582							WOS:000468005400029	30838715

Understanding of the core process of injury-induced HO is still severely limited.MethodsDouble-pulse thymidine analog labeling was used to explore the distinctive domains evolved in injury-induced lesions in an animal model of HO (Nse-BMP4). Histological studies were performed to see whether a similar zonal pattern is also consistently found in biopsies from patients with aHO and FOP. In vivo clonal analysis with Rainbow mice, genetic loss-of-function studies with diphtheria toxin A (DTA)-mediated depletion and lineage tracing with Zsgreen reporter mice were used to obtain further evidence that Tie2-cre-, Gli1-creERT-, and Glast-creERT-labeled cells contribute to HO as niche-dwelling progenitor/stem cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to test whether vasculature, neurites, macrophages, and mast cells are closely associated with the proposed niche and thus are possible candidate niche supportive cells. Similar methods also were employed to further understand the signaling pathways that regulate the niche and the resultant HO.ResultsWe found that distinctive domains evolved in injury-induced lesions, including, from outside-in, a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) niche, a transient domain and an inner differentiated core in an animal model of HO (Nse-BMP4). A similar zonal structure was found in patients with aHO and FOP. In vivo clonal analysis with Rainbow mice and genetic loss-of-function studies with DTA provided evidence that Tie2-cre-, Gli1-creERT-, and Glast-creERT-labeled cells contribute to HO as niche-dwelling progenitor/stem cells; consistently, vasculature, neurites, macrophages, and mast cells are closely associated with the proposed niche and thus are possible candidate niche supportive cells. Further mechanistic study found that BMP and hedgehog (Hh) signaling co-regulate the niche and the resultant HO.ConclusionsAvailable data provide evidence of a potential core mechanism in which multiple disease-specific cellular and extracellular molecular elements form a unique local microenvironment, i.e., an injury-induced stem cell niche, which regulates the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The implication for HO is that therapeutic approaches must consider several different disease specific factors as parts of a functional unit, instead of treating one factor at a time.				zhang, ke/AAH-8217-2019													1757-6512					JAN 11	2019	10								14	10.1186/s13287-018-1107-7							WOS:000455520800003	30635039

Thus, we examined the possible use of CD146 to subtype a heterogeneous hMSC population. Methods: Using flow cytometry and cell sorting, we isolated two distinct hMSC-CD146(+) and hMSC-CD146(-) cell populations from the telomerized human bone marrow-derived stromal cell line (hMSC-TERT). Cells were examined for differences in their size, shape and texture by using high-content analysis and additionally for their ability to differentiate toward osteogenesis in vitro and form bone in vivo, and their migrational ability in vivo and in vitro was investigated. Results: In vitro, the two cell populations exhibited similar growth rate and differentiation capacity to osteoblasts and adipocytes on the basis of gene expression and protein production of lineage-specific markers. In vivo, hMSC-CD146(+) and hMSC-CD146(-) cells formed bone and bone marrow organ when implanted subcutaneously in immune-deficient mice. Bone was enriched in hMSC-CD146(-) cells (12.6 % versus 8.1 %) and bone marrow elements enriched in implants containing hMSC-CD146(+) cells (0.5 % versus 0.05 %). hMSC-CD146(+) cells exhibited greater chemotactic attraction in a transwell migration assay and, when injected intravenously into immune-deficient mice following closed femoral fracture, exhibited wider tissue distribution and significantly increased migration ability as demonstrated by bioluminescence imaging. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate that CD146 defines a subpopulation of hMSCs capable of bone formation and in vivo trans-endothelial migration and thus represents a population of hMSCs suitable for use in clinical protocols of bone tissue regeneration.

Single-cell RNA sequencing of cultured human endometrial CD140b(+)CD146(+) perivascular cells highlights the importance of in vivo microenvironment	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												BackgroundEndometrial mesenchymal-like stromal/stem cells (eMSCs) have been proposed as adult stem cells contributing to endometrial regeneration. One set of perivascular markers (CD140b&CD146) has been widely used to enrich eMSCs. Although eMSCs are easily accessible for regenerative medicine and have long been studied, their cellular heterogeneity, relationship to primary counterpart, remains largely unclear.MethodsIn this study, we applied 10X genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to cultured human CD140b(+)CD146(+) endometrial perivascular cells (ePCs) from menstrual and secretory endometrium. We also analyzed publicly available scRNA-seq data of primary endometrium and performed transcriptome comparison between cultured ePCs and primary ePCs at single-cell level.ResultsTranscriptomic expression-based clustering revealed limited heterogeneity within cultured menstrual and secretory ePCs. A main subpopulation and a small stress-induced subpopulation were identified in secretory and menstrual ePCs. Cell identity analysis demonstrated the similar cellular composition in secretory and menstrual ePCs. Marker gene expression analysis showed that the main subpopulations identified from cultured secretory and menstrual ePCs simultaneously expressed genes marking mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), perivascular cell, smooth muscle cell, and stromal fibroblast. GO enrichment analysis revealed that genes upregulated in the main subpopulation enriched in actin filament organization, cellular division, etc., while genes upregulated in the small subpopulation enriched in extracellular matrix disassembly, stress response, etc. By comparing subpopulations of cultured ePCs to the publicly available primary endometrial cells, it was found that the main subpopulation identified from cultured ePCs was culture-unique which was unlike primary ePCs or primary endometrial stromal fibroblast cells.ConclusionIn summary, these data for the first time provides a single-cell atlas of the cultured human CD140b(+)CD146(+) ePCs. The identification of culture-unique relatively homogenous cell population of CD140b(+)CD146(+) ePCs underscores the importance of in vivo microenvironment in maintaining cellular identity.

Results A total of 25 studies and 41 independent treated arms were used for systematic review and metaanalysis. After adjusted by sensitivity analysis, the mean effect sizes were significantly improved by 0.28 for the age of onset, 0.25 for the disease progression deceleration, 0.54 for the survival time, and 0.48 for hazard ratio reduction. With further analysis, we demonstrated that both the clinical parameter of animal gender and immunosuppressive drug of cyclosporin A (CSA) had a close correlation with disease progression deceleration effect size. Conclusions These results showed that MSCs transplantation was beneficial for neurobehavioral improvement in the treatment of ALS animal model and recommended that all potential reparative roles of MSCs postdelivery, should be carefully considered and fused to maximize the effectiveness of MSCs therapy in ALS.

Artificial microniches for probing mesenchymal stem cell fate in 3D	BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE												Droplet microfluidics is combined with bio-orthogonal thiol-ene click chemistry to fabricate micrometer-sized, monodisperse fibrinogen-containing hyaluronic acid hydrogel microbeads in a mild, radical-free procedure in the presence of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The gel beads serve as microniches for the 3D culture of single hMSCs, containing hyaluronic acid and additional fibrinogen for cell surface binding, and they are porous and stable in tissue culture medium for up to 4 weeks with mechanical properties right in the range of soft solid tissues (0.9-9.2 kPa). The encapsulation procedure results in 70% viable hMSCs in the microbeads after 24 hours of culture and a very high degree of viability of the cells after long term culture of 2 weeks. hMSCs embedded in the microniches display an overall rounded morphology, consistent with those previously observed in 3D culture. Upon induction, the multipotency and differentiation potential of the hMSCs are characterized by staining of corresponding biomarkers, demonstrating a clear heterogeneity in the cell population. These hydrogel microbeads represent a versatile microstructured material platform with great potential for studying the differences of material cues and soluble factors in stem cell differentiation in a 3D tissue-like environment at the single cell level.

Adhesive cultures of umbilical (Wharton's jelly) cells, despite the fibroblast-like shape of the cells and expression of surface markers, intrinsic to mesenchymal stromal cells, are also characterized by high heterogeneity during the initial stages of culturing, judging by an appreciable share of cytokeratin-expressing cells. The terminal placenta chorionic villi can be a source of cells with the most typical morphology and immunophenotypical profile of the resident multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, which retain high viability in vitro and have a high proliferative potential.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) offer tremendous potential for therapeutic applications for inflammatory diseases. However, tissue-derived MSCs, such as bone marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), have considerable donor variations and limited expandability. It was recently demonstrated that MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-MSCs) have less pro-tumor potential and greater expandability of homogenous cell population. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of iPSC-MSCs in a murine model of chemical and mechanical injury to the cornea and compared the effects with those of BM-MSCs. Methods. To create an injury, ethanol was applied to the corneal surface in mice, and the corneal epithelium was removed with a blade. Immediately after injury, mice received an intravenous injection of (i) iPSC-MSCs, (ii) BM-MSCs or (iii) vehicle. Clinical, histological and molecular assays were performed in the cornea to evaluate inflammation. Results. We found that corneal opacity was significantly reduced by iPSC-MSCs or BM-MSCs. Histological examination revealed that the swelling and inflammatory infiltration in the cornea were markedly decreased in mice treated with iPSC-MSCs or BM-MSCs. Corneal levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 were lower in iPSC-MSC- and BM-MSC-treated mice, compared with vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, iPSC-MSCs with a knockdown of the TNF-alpha stimulating gene (TSG)-6 did not suppress the levels of inflammatory cytokines and failed to reduce corneal opacity. Conclusions. Together these data demonstrate that iPSC-MSCs exert therapeutic effects in the cornea by reducing inflammation in part through the expression of TSG-6, and the effects are similar to those seen with BM-MSCs.

Here, four mouse clonal MSC lines, termed MSC1, MSC2, MSC3, and MSC4, were isolated and extensively characterized. MSC4 cells grew most rapidly and formed colonies of the largest size, whereas MSC3 cells exhibited the slowest growth and formed only a few tiny clusters. MSC4 cells could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in vitro, and more importantly, establish hematopoietic microenvironment in vivo; whereas the other lines displayed uni-adipogenic, osteo-chondrogenic, or non-differentiation potential. All lines were positive for Sca-1, CD106, and CD44; MSC4 Was also positive for CD90.2. In terms of immunosuppressive capacity, MSC2, MSC3, and MSC4 cells exerted clear inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, whereas MSC1 did not. Further investigation revealed that the NO and not the PGE2 pathway may play a role in the different immunomodulatory effects of the cell lines. To clarify the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we employed RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles of the four subtypes, revealing a relationship between gene expression and variability in subtype function. This study provides novel information about the heterogeneity of MSCs and insight into the selection of optimal cell sources for therapeutic applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

SIRT3 Enhances Mesenchymal Stem Cell Longevity and Differentiation	OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that are currently being investigated in a wide variety of clinical trials for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as their osteogenic and chondrogenic capabilities. However, there are considerable interdonor variability and heterogeneity of MSC populations, making it challenging to compare different products. Furthermore, proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation of MSCs decrease with aging and ex vivo expansion. The sirtuins have emerged as a class of protein deacylases involved in aging, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the major mitochondrial deacetylase involved in reducing oxidative stress while preserving oxidative metabolism, and its levels have been shown to decrease with age. This study investigated the role of SIRT3 in MSC differentiation and aging. As MSCs were expanded ex vivo, SIRT3 levels decreased. In addition, SIRT3 depletion reduced MSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Furthermore, overexpression of SIRT3 in later-passage MSCs reduced aging-related senescence, reduced oxidative stress, and enhanced their ability to differentiate. These data suggest that overexpressing SIRT3 might represent a strategy to increase the quality and quantity of MSCs utilized for clinical applications.

We found that poor to moderate survival benefits of MSC-implanted rats were caused by incomplete electromechanical integration induced by tissue heterogeneity between myocytes and engrafted MSCs in the infarcted myocardium. Here, we report the development of cardiogenic cells from rat MSCs activated by phorbol myristate acetate, a PKC activator, that exhibited high expressions of cardiac-specific markers and Ca2+ homeostasis-related proteins and showed adrenergic receptor signaling by norepinephrine. Histological analysis showed high connexin 43 coupling, few inflammatory cells, and low fibrotic markers in myocardium implanted with these phorbol myristate acetate-activated MSCs. Infarct hearts implanted with these cells exhibited restoration of conduction velocity through decreased tissue heterogeneity and improved myocardial contractility. These findings have major implications for the development of better cell types for electromechanical integration of cell-based treatment for infarcted myocardium.

Proximity-Based Differential Single-Cell Analysis of the Niche to Identify Stem/Progenitor Cell Regulators	Cell Stem Cell												Physiological stem cell function is regulated by secreted factors produced by niche cells. In this study, we describe an unbiased approach based on the differential single-cell gene expression analysis of mesenchymal osteolineage cells close to, and further removed from, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to identify candidate niche factors. Mesenchymal cells displayed distinct molecular profiles based on their relative location. We functionally examined, among the genes that were preferentially expressed in proximal cells, three secreted or cell-surface molecules not previously connected to HSPC biology-the secreted RNase angiogenin, the cytokine IL18, and the adhesion molecule Embigin-and discovered that all of these factors are HSPC quiescence regulators. Therefore, our proximity-based differential single-cell approach reveals molecular heterogeneity within niche cells and can be used to identify novel extrinsic stem/progenitor cell regulators. Similar approaches could also be applied to other stem cell/niche pairs to advance the understanding of microenvironmental regulation of stem cell function.

It is also relevant in metastasis and can explain how metastatic tumors mirror the heterogeneity of primary tumors. Cellular plasticity, including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enables the generation of CSCs at different steps of the metastatic process including metastatic colonization. In this review, we update the concept of CSCs and provide evidence of the existence of metastatic stem cells (MetSCs). In addition, we highlight the nuanced understanding of EMT that has been gained recently and the association of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) with the acquisition of CSCs properties during metastasis. We also comment on the computational approaches that have profoundly influenced our understanding of CSCs and EMT; and how these studies and new experimental technologies can yield a deeper understanding of the biological aspects of metastasis.

This limitation may be partially attributable to tumor cell subpopulations with intrinsic resistance to current drugs. Within squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines, we previously characterized a subpopulation of mesenchymal-like cells displaying phenotypic plasticity and increased resistance to both cytotoxic and targeted agents. These mesenchymal-like (Ecad-lo) cells are separable from epithelial-like (Ecad-hi) cells based on loss of surface E-cadherin and expression of vimentin. Despite their long-term plasticity, both Ecad-lo and Ecad-hi subsets in short-term culture maintained nearly uniform phenotypes after purification. This stability allowed testing of segregated subpopulations for relative sensitivity to the cytotoxic agent cisplatin in comparison to salinomycin, a compound with reported activity against CD44(+)CD24(-) stem-like cells in breast carcinomas. Salinomycin showed comparable efficacy against both Ecad-hi and Ecad-lo cells, in contrast to cisplatin, which selectively depleted Ecad-hi cells. An in vivo correlate of these mesenchymal-like Ecad-lo cells was identified by immunohistochemical detection of vimentin-positive malignant subsets across a part of direct tumor xenografts (DTXs) of advanced stage SCC patient samples. Cisplatin treatment of mice with established DTXs caused enrichment of vimentin-positive malignant cells in residual tumors, but salinomycin depleted the same subpopulation. These results demonstrate that mesenchymal-like SCC cells, which resist current chemotherapies, respond to a treatment strategy developed against a stem-like subset in breast carcinoma. Further, they provide evidence of mesenchymal-like subsets being well-represented across advanced stage SCCs, suggesting that intrinsic drug resistance in this subpopulation has high clinical relevance.

Cancer Stem Cells in Solid and Liquid Tissues of Breast Cancer Patients: Characterization and Therapeutic Perspectives	CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS												Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) represent a heterogeneous subpopulation of rare cells within breast cancer tumors, displaying an enhanced tumor initiating capability and underlying disease progression and therapy resistance. Unraveling their phenotypic, biological and functional profile is a major challenge in the context of diminishing patient mortality. In this review, following a brief description on how cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their microenvironment contribute to tumor preservation and heterogeneity, we summarize the current literature regarding the molecular signature of BCSCs either localized in the primary tumor or circulating in the blood of breast cancer patients. We present recent data on specific stem and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers designating the BCSC subpopulation and underline their pathogenic significance. The molecular characterization of BCSCs has promoted the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting the BCSC subpopulation which are currently being experimentally and clinically evaluated. We highlight recent advances on the development of novel BCSC-targeting therapeutic strategies including the inhibition of cell signaling pathways, differentiation therapy, metabolic interference and nucleotide-, bio-and nano-technology based approaches. Eliminating the chemo-and radio-resistance properties of breast cancer tumor cells via BCSC-directed therapies, combined to conventional therapeutic approaches, will augment the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment and improve the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients.

However, the heterogeneity of CNCCs and their tendency to spontaneously differentiate along smooth muscle or osteoblast lineages in vitro limit further understanding of their biological properties. We studied the differentiation properties of isolated rat embryonic postmigratoty CNCCs, expressing p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). These p75NTR positive (p75) CNCCs, isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorter, exhibited fibroblast-like morphology and characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. Incubation of p75 CNCCs in dental follicle cell conditioned medium (DFCCM) combined with dentin non-collagenous proteins (dNCPs), altered their morphological features to cementoblast-like appearance. These cells also showed low proliferative activity, high ALP activity and significantly increased calcified nodule formation. Markers related to mineralization or specific to cementoblast lineage were highly expressed in dNCPs/DFCCM-treated p75(+) cells, suggesting their differentiation along cementoblast-like lineage. p75(+) stem cells selected from postmigratory CNCCs represent a pure stem cell population and could be used as a stem cell model for in vitro studies due to their intrinsic ability to differentiate to neuronal cells and transform from neuroectoderm to ectomesenchyme. They can provide a potential stem cell resource for tooth engineering studies and help to further investigate mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in tooth morphogenesis.

J	Oliveri, RS; Bello, S; Biering-Sorensen, F				Oliveri, Roberto S.; Bello, Segun; Biering-Sorensen, Fin			Mesenchymal stem cells improve locomotor recovery in traumatic spinal cord injury: Systematic review with meta-analyses of rat models	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE												Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event with huge personal and societal costs. A limited number of treatments exist to ameliorate the progressive secondary damage that rapidly follows the primary mechanical impact. Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and may thus reduce secondary damage after administration. We performed a systematic review with quantitative syntheses to assess the evidence of MSCs versus controls for locomotor recovery in rat models of traumatic SCI, and identified 83 eligible controlled studies comprising a total of 1,568 rats. Between-study heterogeneity was large. Fifty-three studies (64%) were reported as randomised, but only four reported adequate methodologies for randomisation. Forty-eight studies (58%) reported the use of a blinded outcome assessment. A random-effects meta-analysis yielded a difference in behavioural Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor score means of 3.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2 to 4.7; P<0.001) in favour of MSCs. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the findings of the meta-analyses with the upper monitoring boundary for benefit being crossed by the cumulative Z-curve before reaching the diversity-adjusted required information size. Only time from intervention to last follow-up remained statistically significant after adjustment using multivariate randomeffects meta-regression modelling. Lack of other demonstrable explanatory variables could be due to insufficient meta-analytic study power. MSCs would seem to demonstrate a substantial beneficial effect on locomotor recovery in a widely-used animal model of traumatic SCI. However, the animal results should be interpreted with caution concerning the internal and external validity of the studies in relation to the design of future clinical trials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, we observed that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from ITP patients exhibited growth defects and functional abnormalities that might be involved in the breakdown of self-tolerance. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we profiled the expression of both mRNAs and miRNAs by utilizing the microarray technique and deciphered the mechanism underlying the impairment of MSCs derived from ITP patients (MSC-ITP). In total, we identified 740 genes and 32 miRNAs that were differentially expressed between ITP patients and controls. A compromised unfolded protein response (UPR) and decreased DNA transcription were shown to be significantly related to MSC-ITP. The interaction of miRNA with mRNA suggested that the cellular stress response, the UPR, and DNA transcription may be involved in the defects observed in MSC-ITP. Key differentially expressed genes were further validated by RT-PCR. Our results highlight that defects in the cellular stress response, as shown by a compromised UPR and differential DNA transcription, play key roles in causing the abnormalities observed in MSC-ITP. These data might contribute to a better understanding of the abnormal bone marrow niche and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of ITP.				Chang, Ying-Jun/AAA-1182-2020; Zheng, X.

Tumor cells at the tumor margin lose epithelial properties and acquire features of mesenchymal cells. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested to be of prime importance for tissue and vessel invasion. Recently, features of EMT were shown to be linked to cells with tumor-founding capability, so- called cancer stem cells (CSC). In this study we show that transcription factors associated with EMT markers Snail, Slug, Twist and Zeb1 are differentially expressed between normal breast epithelium, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer. Both invasive and in situ carcinoma expressed less Slug and Twist and more Zeb1 compared to normal epithelium. Using fluorescence multi-staining the number of potential CSC among invasive cancer cells varied dramatically depending on the staining combination used (18.5% for CD44(+)/CD24(-) and 2.4% for CD49f(+)/ CD24(+)). Interestingly, neither transcription factors associated with EMT nor potential CSC counts varied between tumor centre and invasion front. No association of these features with clinical outcome was detected. Our results suggest that reliable in situ markers for EMT are missing for invasive breast cancer. Alternatively, the process of EMT might be activated in tumor cells at the margin as well as the centre. Furthermore, our data show that the bin-markers of CSC detect very variable cell populations within breast cancer, challenging the assumption of a hierarchical organization of CSC in these tumors.

Characterizing heterogeneity in the response of synovial mesenchymal progenitor cells to synovial macrophages in normal individuals and patients with osteoarthritis	JOURNAL OF INFLAMMATION-LONDON												Background: Resident macrophages in OA synovial tissue contribute to synovitis through pro-inflammatory mediators driving cartilage loss. What remains unknown is how these macrophages interact with synovial mesenchymal progenitor cells (sMPCs) in the joint. sMPCs have the potential to undergo chondrogenesis, but for yet unknown reasons, this ability is decreased in OA patients. In this study, we sought to identify if alteration of macrophage activity regulates the chondrogenic capacity of sMPCs. Methods: An explant model was developed using human synovium obtained from normal individuals and OA patients. These explants were subjected to macrophage depletion and/or cytokine stimulation in order to regulate/deplete the residing macrophage population. Supernatant was collected following a 12-day treatment phase and subjected to inflammatory secretome analysis. sMPCs from the explants were subsequently placed under 21-day chondrogenic differentiation and levels of type II collagen (Col2a), Aggrecan (Acan), and Sox9 gene expression was quantified. Results: Inflammatory secretome analysis from OA patients revealed the presence of pro-inflammatory analytes following pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine stimulation and/or macrophage depletion. Additionally, chondrogenic differentiation of sMPCs was heterogeneously impacted across all OA patients following pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine stimulation and/or macrophage depletion. Conclusion: Tissue resident synovial macrophages can regulate the chondrogenic differentiation of sMPCs after cytokine stimulation in a patient specific manner. The secretion profile of OA synovium was also responsive to cytokine stimulation and/or macrophage depletion as observed by the largely pro-inflammatory milieu upregulated following cytokine stimulation.

Osteogenic potential of sorted equine mesenchymal stem cell subpopulations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE VETERINAIRE												The objectives of this study were to use non-equilibrium gravitational field-flow fractionation (GrFFF), an immunotag-less method of sorting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), to sort equine muscle tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) into subpopulations and to carry out assays in order to compare their osteogenic capabilities. Cells from 1 young adult horse were isolated from left semitendinosus muscle tissue and from bone marrow aspirates of the fourth and fifth sternebrae. Aliquots of 800 x 10(3) MSCs from each tissue source were sorted into 5 fractions using non-equilibrium GrFFF (GrFFF proprietary system). Pooled fractions were cultured and expanded for use in osteogenic assays, including flow cytometry, histochemistry, bone nodule assays, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for gene expression of osteocalcin (OCN), RUNX2, and osterix. Equine MMSCs and BMSCs were consistently sorted into 5 fractions that remained viable for use in further osteogenic assays. Statistical analysis confirmed strongly significant upregulation of OCN, RUNX2, and osterix for the BMSC fraction 4 with P < 0.00001. Flow cytometry revealed different cell size and granularity for BMSC fraction 4 and MMSC fraction 2 compared to unsorted controls and other fractions. Histochemisty and bone nodule assays revealed positive staining nodules without differences in average nodule area, perimeter, or stain intensity between tissues or fractions. As there are different subpopulations of MSCs with different osteogenic capacities within equine muscle-and bone marrow-derived sources, these differences must be taken into account when using equine stem cell therapy to induce bone healing in veterinary medicine.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are heterogeneous and only a subset possesses multipotent differentiation potential. It has been proven that long-term culture has functional implications for MSC. However, little is known how the composition of subpopulation changes during culture expansion. Methods. We addressed the heterogeneity of MSC using limiting-dilution assays at subsequent passages. In addition, we used a cellular automaton model to simulate population dynamics under the assumption of mixed numbers of remaining cell divisions until replicative senescence. The composition of cells with adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation potential during expansion was also determined at subsequent passages. Results. Not every cell was capable of colony formation upon passaging. Notably, the number of fibroblastoid colony-forming units (CFU-f) decreased continuously, with a rapid decay within early passages. Therefore the CFU-f frequency might be used as an indicator of the population doublings remaining before entering the senescent state. Predictions of the cellular automaton model suited the experimental data best if most cells were already close to their replicative limit by the time of culture initiation. Analysis of differentiated clones revealed that subsets with very high levels of adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation capacity were only observed at early passages. Conclusions. These data support the notion of heterogeneity in MSC, and also with regard to replicative senescence. The composition of subpopulations changes during culture expansion and clonogenic subsets, especially those with the highest differentiation capacity, decrease already at early passages.

Single cell sequencing reveals heterogeneity within ovarian cancer epithelium and cancer associated stromal cells	GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY												Objectives. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of heterogeneity in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) by analyzing RNA expression in single epithelial and cancer associated stromal cells. In addition, we explored the possibility of identifying subgroups based on pathway activation and pre-defined signatures from cancer stem cells and chemo-resistant cells. Methods. A fresh, HGSOC tumor specimen derived from ovary was enzymatically digested and depleted of immune infiltrating cells. RNA sequencing was performed on 92 single cells and 66 of these single cell datasets passed quality control checks. Sequences were analyzed using multiple bioinformatics tools, including clustering, principle components analysis, and geneset enrichment analysis to identify subgroups and activated pathways. Immunohistochemistry for ovarian cancer, stem cell and stromal markers was performed on adjacent tumor sections. Results. Analysis of the gene expression patterns identified two major subsets of cells characterized by epithelial and stromal gene expression patterns. The epithelial group was characterized by proliferative genes including genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and MYC activity, while the stromal group was characterized by increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Neither group expressed a signature correlating with published chemo-resistant gene signatures, but many cells, predominantly in the stromal subgroup, expressed markers associated with cancer stem cells. Conclusions. Single cell sequencing provides a means of identifying subpopulations of cancer cells within a single patient. Single cell sequence analysis may prove to be critical for understanding the etiology, progression and drug resistance in ovarian cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

There is still lack of consensus between laboratories on this issue but recent advancements in this field have shed light on the identity of these cells in humans. However, in mice there are limited and reproducible data available that convincingly define prospectively these cells in vivo. In this review we will critically address: 1) important considerations on how to interpret MPC nomenclature, heterogeneity and differentiation abilities; 2) potential surface antigens that could aid in the isolation of MPC from mouse BM; 3) and their topography and prospective cellular relationship with pericytes, adventitial reticulocytes (ARCs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

Tenogenesis of bone marrow-, adipose-, and tendon-derived stem cells in a dynamic bioreactor	CONNECTIVE TISSUE RESEARCH												Tendons are frequently damaged and fail to regenerate, leading to pain, loss of function, and reduced quality of life. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess clinically useful tissue-regenerative properties and have been exploited for use in tendon tissue engineering and cell therapy. However, MSCs exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity based on the donor tissue used, and the efficacy of cell-based treatment modalities may be improved by optimizing cell source based on relative differentiation capacity. Equine MSCs were isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose (AD), and tendon (TN), expanded in monolayer prior to seeding on decellularized tendon scaffolds (DTS), and cell-laden constructs were placed in a bioreactor designed to mimic the biophysical environment of the tendon. It was hypothesized that TN MSCs would differentiate toward a tendon cell phenotype better than BM and AD MSCs in response to a conditioning period involving cyclic mechanical stimulation for 1 hour per day at 3% strain and 0.33 Hz. All cell types integrated into DTS adopted an elongated morphology similar to tenocytes, expressed tendon marker genes, and improved tissue mechanical properties after 11 days. TN MSCs expressed the greatest levels of scleraxis, collagen type-I, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. Major histocompatibility class-II protein mRNA expression was not detected in any of the MSC types, suggesting low immunogenicity for allogeneic transplantation. The results suggest that TN MSCs are the ideal cell type for regenerative medicine therapies for tendinopathies, exhibiting the most mature tendon-like phenotype in vitro. When TN MSCs are unavailable, BM or AD MSCs may serve as robust alternatives.

Investigating heterogeneities of live mesenchymal stromal cells using AI-based label-free imaging	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that have great potential for regenerative medicine, tissue repair, and immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the outcomes of MSC-based research and therapies can be highly inconsistent and difficult to reproduce, largely due to the inherently significant heterogeneity in MSCs, which has not been well investigated. To quantify cell heterogeneity, a standard approach is to measure marker expression on the protein level via immunochemistry assays. Performing such measurements non-invasively and at scale has remained challenging as conventional methods such as flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy typically require cell fixation and laborious sample preparation. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method that converts transmitted light microscopy images of MSCs into quantitative measurements of protein expression levels. By training a U-Net+ conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model that accurately (mean rs = 0.77) predicts expression of 8 MSC-specific markers, we showed that expression of surface markers provides a heterogeneity characterization that is complementary to conventional cell-level morphological analyses. Using this label-free imaging method, we also observed a multi-marker temporal-spatial fluctuation of protein distributions in live MSCs. These demonstrations suggest that our AI-based microscopy can be utilized to perform quantitative, non-invasive, single-cell, and multi-marker characterizations of heterogeneous live MSC culture. Our method provides a foundational step toward the instant integrative assessment of MSC properties, which is critical for high-throughput screening and quality control in cellular therapies.																	2045-2322					MAR 24	2021	11	1							6728	10.1038/s41598-021-85905-z							WOS:000634969500017	33762607

Surface expression marker profile in colon cancer cell lines and sphere-derived cells suggests complexity in CD26(+) cancer stem cells subsets	BIOLOGY OPEN												Taking advantage of eight established cell lines from colorectal cancer patients at different stages of the disease and the fact that all of them could form spheres, cell surface biomarkers of cancer stem cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were tested. The aim was to investigate cancer stem cells and metastatic stem cells in order to provide functional characterization of circulating tumor cells and promote the development of new anti-metastatic therapies. Our model showed an important heterogeneity in EpCAM, CD133, CD44, LGR5, CD26 and E-cadherin expression. We showed the presence of a subset of E-cadherin(+) (some cells being E-cadherin(high)) expressing CD26(+) (or CD26(high)) together with the well-known CSC markers LGR5 and EpCAM(high), sometimes in the absence of CD44 or CD133. The already described CD26(+)/E-cadherin(low) or (negative) and CD26(+)/ EpCAM(-) /CD133(-) subsets were also present. Cell division drastically affected the expression of all markers, in particular E-cadherin, so newborn cells resembled mesenchymal cells in surface staining. CD26 and/or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors have already shown antimetastatic effects in pre-clinical models, and the existence of these CD26' subsets may help further research against cancer metastasis.

This heterogeneity may interfere with the multi-differentiation potential of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs). It is therefore necessary to establish an efficient method for isolating ADMSCs that have high multi-differentiation potential. Several studies indicated that mucosialin (CD34) might be one of the specific markers of ADMSCs. In our previous studies, a CD34-enriched cell population sorted from the pooled SVF had stronger differentiation potential than that of unsorted cells in a hair follicle morphogenesis model. However, it remains unclear whether CD34-enriched cells have stronger potential for other lineage differentiation, particularly osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. In this study, CD34(+) cells were harvested and sorted from murine adipose-derived cells and their potentials for osteogenesis and chondrogesis were examined using engineered bone and cartilage models. The results show that CD34(+) cells exhibited stronger potential for bone formation with stronger van Gieson and collagen I staining than those of CD34(-) cells and an unsorted SVF when seeded on beta-tricalcium phosphate. Furthermore, CD34(+) cells also exhibited a much stronger chondrogenic potential than those of CD34(-) cells and an unsorted SVF, with stronger staining of toluidine blue, Safranin-O, and collagen II in a chondrocyte pellet and engineered cartilage. Most importantly, only CD34(+) cells could form a cartilage-like lacunae structure. All these results indicate that CD34(-) may serve as a specific surface marker for enriching ADMSCs in ASCs.																	1609-0985	2199-4757					2014	34	3			SI		230	237		10.5405/jmbe.1581							WOS:000339052700005

Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells for Tissue-Engineered Solutions to Congenital Heart Defects	BIOMARKER INSIGHTS												Synthetic patches and fixed grafts currently used in the repair of congenital heart defects are nonliving, noncontractile, and not electrically responsive, leading to increased risk of complication, reoperation, and sudden cardiac death. Studies suggest that tissue-engineered patches made from living, functional cells could grow with the patient, facilitate healing, and help recover cardiac function. In this paper, we review the research into possible sources of cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cells, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, umbilical cord blood cells, amniotic fluid-derived stem cells, and cardiac progenitor cells. Each cell source has advantages, but also has technical hurdles to overcome, including heterogeneity, functional maturity, immunogenicity, and pathogenicity. Additionally, biomaterials used as patch materials will need to attract and support desired cells and induce minimal immune responses.

Generation of cancer stem-like cells through the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells	ONCOGENE												Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed by pathologists for over a century. PGCCs contribute to solid tumor heterogeneity, but their functions are largely undefined. Little attention has been given to these cells, largely because PGCCs have been generally thought to originate from repeated failure of mitosis/cytokinesis and have no capacity for long-term survival or proliferation. Here we report our successful purification and culture of PGCCs from human ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer. These cells are highly resistant to oxygen deprivation and could form through endoreduplication or cell fusion, generating regular-sized cancer cells quickly through budding or bursting similar to simple organisms like fungi. They express normal and cancer stem cell markers, they divide asymmetrically and they cycle slowly. They can differentiate into adipose, cartilage and bone. A single PGCC formed cancer spheroids in vitro and generated tumors in immunodeficient mice. These PGCC-derived tumors gained a mesenchymal phenotype with increased expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44 and CD133 and become more resistant to treatment with cisplatin. Taken together, our results reveal that PGCCs represent a resistant form of human cancer using an ancient, evolutionarily conserved mechanism in response to hypoxia stress; they can contribute to the generation of cancer stem-like cells, and also play a fundamental role in regulating tumor heterogeneity, tumor growth and chemoresistance in human cancer.																	0950-9232	1476-5594				JAN	2014	33	1					116	128		10.1038/onc.2013.96							WOS:000329212000013	23524583

Embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like clusters started to appear between 15 to 20 days post transduction. Morphology of the colonies resembled that of ESC colonies with defined border and tightly-packed cells. The reprogrammed sarcomas expressed alkaline phosphatase and pluripotency markers, OCT4, SSEA4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, as in ESC up to Passage 15. All reprogrammed sarcomas could form embryoid body-like spheres when cultured in suspension in a low attachment dish for up to 10 days. Further testing on the directed differentiation capacity of the reprogrammed sarcomas showed all four reprogrammed sarcoma lines could differentiate into adipocytes while reprogrammed Saos-2-REP, MG-63-REP and G-292-REP could differentiate into osteocytes. Among the 4 osteosarcoma cell lines, U-2 OS reported the highest transduction efficiency but recorded the lowest reprogramming stability under long term culture. Thus, there may be intrinsic differences governing the variable responses of osteosarcoma cell lines towards reprogramming and long term culture effect of the reprogrammed cells. This is a first report to associate intrinsic factors in different osteosarcoma cell lines with variable reprogramming responses and effects on the reprogrammed cells after prolonged culture.

However, the functional heterogeneity of cells derived from different tissues has hampered providing definitive phenotypic markers for these cells. Objective: To characterize and compare the phenotype and cytokines of adipose derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) and tumoral-MSCs (T-MSCs) isolated from mammary tumors of BALB/c mice. Methods: Immunophenotyping and in vitro differentiation tests were used for MSC characterization. Cytokine and enzyme profiles were assessed using ELISA and Real-time PCR, respectively. Results: T-MSCs expressed significantly higher levels of HLADR (p=0.04). Higher levels of PGE2 and COX-2 enzyme were also observed in TMSCs (p=0.07 and p=0.00, respectively). Additionally, T-MSCs expressed higher levels of iNOS and MMP9 (p=0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). T-MSCs were also able to induce higher levels of proliferation and migration of HUVEC endothelial cells in wound scratch assay compared to AD-MSCs (p=0.015). Conclusion: Functional differences showed by the surface markers of MSCs, cytokine and enzyme production indicate the effect of different microenvironments on MSCs phenotype and function.

Isolation of human mesenchymal stromal cells is more efficient by red blood cell lysis	CYTOTHERAPY												Background Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have raised high hopes for tissue engineering and clinical therapy. Their isolation usually involves density fractionation of mononuclear cells (MNC) but this is difficult to standardize, especially under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. MSC represent a heterogeneous mixture of cell types and the composition of subpopulations is affected by the initial steps of cell preparation. Methods This study describes a straightforward method for isolation of human MSC based on red blood cell (RBC) lysis with ammonium chloride. Colony formation was compared directly with Ficoll density fractionation and culture of an untreated whole bone marrow (BM) aspirate. Results After 7 days the number of fibroblastic colony-forming units (CFU-F) per milliliter of BM aspirate was slightly higher upon RBC lysis and the colonies were significantly larger compared with density fractionation, possibly because of maintenance of platelets. In contrast, colony formation was much lower in untreated BM. The heterogeneous composition of subpopulations was reflected by differences between the initial colonies with regard to growth pattern (tight or disperse) and cell morphology (round or elongated). This heterogeneous composition was not affected by the three different isolation methods. Furthermore, enrichment of CD271+ cells resulted in the same morphologic heterogeneity. All cell preparations demonstrated the same immunophenotype using a panel of surface markers and displayed adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. Discussion This study demonstrates that human MSC can be efficiently isolated by RBC lysis. This technique is faster and can be standardized more easily for clinical application of MSC.

Diverse factors seem to be able to influence cell quality and performance, especially factors related to donors' intrinsic characteristics, such as age. Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding this characteristic, and there is conflicting information in the literature. AIM To investigate the growth kinetics and differentiation potential of adipose-derived stem cells isolated from the lipoaspirates of elderly and young donors. METHODS hASCs were harvested from liposuctioned adipose tissue obtained from female donors (aged 20-70 years). Cells were distributed into two groups according to age range: old hASCs (oASCs, >= 55 years, n = 9) and young hASCs (yASCs, <= 35 years, n = 9). For each group, immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry. Population doubling time was assessed over seven days. For adipogenic potential evaluation, lipid deposits were assessed after 7 d, 14 d and 21 d of adipogenic induction. Osteogenic potential was verified by analyzing cell mineralization after 14 d, 21 d and 28 d of osteogenic induction. mRNA expression of PPAR.2, CEBPA and Runx2 were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS hASCs were successfully obtained, cultured, and grouped according to their age: yASCs (26.33 +/- 4.66 years old) and oASCs (64.78 +/- 4.58 years old). After maintenance of the cells in culture, there were no differences in morphology between cells from the young and old donors. Additionally, both groups showed classical immunophenotypic characteristics of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. The average doubling time indicated that yASCs (4.09 +/- 0.94 d) did not significantly differ from oASCs (4.19 +/- 1.29 d). Concerning differentiation potential, after adipogenic and osteogenic induction, yASCs and oASCs were able to differentiate to greater levels than the noninduced control cells. However, no differences were found in the differentiation efficiency of yASCs and oASCs in adipogenesis or osteogenesis. Additionally, the mRNA expression of PPAR gamma 2, CEBPA and Runx2 were similar in yASCs and oASCs. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that age does not seem to significantly affect the cell division or adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation ability of adipose-derived stem cells isolated from lipoaspirates.

Targeting of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells by Cre-Recombinase Transgenes Commonly Used to Target Osteoblast Lineage Cells	JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH												The targeting specificity of tissue-specific Cre-recombinase transgenes is a key to interpreting phenotypes associated with their use. The Ocn-Cre and Dmp1-Cre transgenes are widely used to target osteoblasts and osteocytes, respectively. Here, we used high-resolution microscopy of bone sections and flow cytometry to carefully define the targeting specificity of these transgenes. These transgenes were crossed with Cxcl12(gfp) mice to identify Cxcl12-abundant reticular ( CAR) cells, which are a perivascular mesenchymal stromal population implicated in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell maintenance. We show that in addition to osteoblasts, Ocn-Cre targets a majority of CAR cells and arteriolar pericytes. Surprisingly, Dmp1-Cre also targets a subset of CAR cells, in which expression of osteoblast-lineage genes is enriched. Finally, we introduce a new tissue-specific Cre-recombinase, Tagln-Cre, which efficiently targets osteoblasts, a majority of CAR cells, and both venous sinusoidal and arteriolar pericytes. These data show that Ocn-Cre and Dmp1-Cre target broader stromal cell populations than previously appreciated and may aid in the design of future studies. Moreover, these data highlight the heterogeneity of mesenchymal stromal cells in the bone marrow and provide tools to interrogate this heterogeneity.

The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) has long been recognized for its role in tumourigenesis and growth. The IGF/IGF1R pathway is important in maintaining cell survival. It is reported that IGF1R participates in the occurrence of NB, but the mechanism is still unclear. Methods: Human NB cell lines IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y were recruited in this study. IGF1R was knocked down by transfection with short hairpin RNA. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression was inhibited by Cryptotanshinone treatment. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined by MTT assay, wound healing assay, and cell invasion assay, respectively. The cancer stem cell properties were characterized by tumour sphere formation assay and colony formation assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of related proteins were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Results: The knockdown of IGF1R inhibits NB cell tumourigenesis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NB cells. Additionally, IGF1R was found to stimulate cancer stem cell-like properties in NPC cells. The knockdown of IGF1R significantly reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, and STAT3, indicating that the activation of the AKT and STAT3 pathways was inhibited by IGF1R knockdown. Furthermore, IGF1R was demonstrated to stimulate cancer stem cell-like properties in NB cells via the regulation of the STAT3/AKT axis. Conclusion: IGF1R promotes cancer stem cell properties to facilitate EMT in neuroblastoma via the STAT3/AKT axis.																	1179-1322						2019	11						5459	5472		10.2147/CMAR.S196862							WOS:000471659300001	31354352

However, due to the heterogeneity observed in the EVs isolated from MSCs, it is unclear which population is responsible for the proregenerative effects. We therefore evaluated the effect of various EV populations separated by differential ultracentrifugation (10K population enriched with microvesicles and 100K population enriched with exosomes) on AKI recovery. Only the exosomal-enriched population induced an improvement of renal function and morphology comparable with that of the total EV population. Interestingly, the 100K EVs exerted a proproliferative effect on murine tubular epithelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the molecular content from the different EV populations revealed a distinct profile. The 100K population, for instance, was enriched in specific mRNAs (CCNB1, CDK8, CDC6) reported to influence cell cycle entry and progression; miRNAs involved in regulating proliferative/antiapoptotic pathways and growth factors (hepatocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1) that could explain the effect of renal tubular cell proliferation. On the other hand, the EV population enriched in microvesicles (10K) was unable to induce renal regeneration and had a molecular profile with lower expression of proproliferative molecules. In conclusion, the different molecular composition of exosome- and microvesicle-enriched populations may explain the regenerative effect of EVs observed in AKI.

Single-Cell RNA-Seq of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Reveals Unique Profiles of Lineage Priming	PLOS ONE												The plasticity and immunomodulatory capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have spurred clinical use in recent years. However, clinical outcomes vary and many ascribe inconsistency to the tissue source of MSCs. Yet unconsidered is the extent of heterogeneity of individual MSCs from a given tissue source with respect to differentiation potential and immune regulatory function. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional diversity of murine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. We found genes associated with MSC multipotency were expressed at a high level and with consistency between individual cells. However, genes associated with osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, neurogenic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation were expressed at widely varying levels between individual cells. Further, certain genes associated with immunomodulation were also inconsistent between individual cells. Differences could not be ascribed to cycles of proliferation, culture bias or other cellular process, which might alter transcript expression in a regular or cyclic pattern. These results support and extend the concept of lineage priming of MSCs and emphasize caution for in vivo or clinical use of MSCs, even when immunomodulation is the goal, since multiple mesodermal (and even perhaps ectodermal) outcomes are a possibility. Purification might enable shifting of the probability of a certain outcome, but is unlikely to remove multilineage potential altogether.																	1932-6203					SEP 9	2015	10	9							e0136199	10.1371/journal.pone.0136199							WOS:000360932800030	26352588

Separation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Through a Strategic Centrifugation Protocol	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS												Despite great promise surrounding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), their implementation for tissue engineering strategies remains in the development phases. Many of the concerns regarding the clinical use of MSCs originate from population heterogeneity, during both isolation and differentiation. In this study, we utilize our previously developed centrifugation cell adhesion protocol for the separation of MSCs. Our findings reveal that MSCs can be isolated from whole bone marrow using a 200 g (700 pN) centrifugal force after 24 h of culture on polystyrene with cell surface marker expression equivalent to positive controls. During differentiation, a centrifugation protocol with identical force parameters could be applied 14 days into chondrogenic differentiation to isolate differentiated chondrocytes, which exhibited increased expression of chondrogenic markers compared to controls. In summary, the use of our developed centrifugation cell adhesion protocol has proven to be an effective means to separate MSC populations, decreasing the heterogeneity of subsequent cell therapy products.																	1937-3384	1937-3392				APR 1	2016	22	4					348	359		10.1089/ten.tec.2015.0408							WOS:000373237600006	26797048

Epithelial/mesenchymal heterogeneity of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples correlates with miRNA let-7 levels and predicts tumor growth and metastasis	MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY												Patient-derived samples present an advantage over current cell line models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) that are not always reliable and phenotypically faithful models ofin vivoHGSOC. To improve upon cell line models of HGSOC, we set out to characterize a panel of patient-derived cells and determine their epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. We analyzed RNA and protein expression levels in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HGSOC, and functionally characterized these models using flow cytometry, wound healing assays, invasion assays, and spheroid cultures. Besidesin vitrowork, we also evaluated the growth characteristics of PDXin vivo(orthotopic PDX). We found that all samples had hybrid characteristics, covering a spectrum from an epithelial-to-mesenchymal state. Samples with a stronger epithelial phenotype were more active in self-renewal assays and more tumorigenic in orthotopic xenograft models as compared to samples with a stronger mesenchymal phenotype, which were more migratory and invasive. Additionally, we observed an inverse association between microRNAlet-7(lethal-7) expression and stemness, consistent with the loss oflet-7being an important component of the cancer stem cell phenotype. We observed that lowerlet-7levels were associated with the epithelial state and a lower epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) score, more efficient spheroid and tumor formation, and increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Surprisingly, in these HGSOC cells, stemness could be dissociated from invasiveness: Cells with lowerlet-7levels were more tumorigenic, but less migratory, and with a lower EMT score, than those with higherlet-7levels. We conclude thatlet-7expression and epithelial/mesenchymal state are valuable predictors of HGSOC proliferation,in vitroself-renewal, and tumor burdenin vivo.

However, significant heterogeneity in DPSC expansion and multi-potency capabilities are well-established, attributed to contrasting telomere profiles and susceptibilities to replicative senescence. As DPSCs possess negligible human telomerase (hTERT) expression, we examined whether intrinsic differences in the susceptibilities of DPSC sub-populations to oxidative stress-induced biomolecular damage and premature senescence further contributed to this heterogeneity, via differential enzymic antioxidant capabilities between DPSCs.MethodsDPSCs were isolated from human third molars by differential fibronectin adhesion, and positive mesenchymal (CD73/CD90/CD105) and negative hematopoietic (CD45) stem cell marker expression confirmed. Isolated sub-populations were expanded in H2O2 (0-200 mu M) and established as high or low proliferative DPSCs, based on population doublings (PDs) and senescence (telomere lengths, SA-beta -galactosidase, p53/p16(INK4a)/p21(waf1)/hTERT) marker detection. The impact of DPSC expansion on mesenchymal, embryonic, and neural crest marker expression was assessed, as were the susceptibilities of high and low proliferative DPSCs to oxidative DNA and protein damage by immunocytochemistry. Expression profiles for superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase, and glutathione-related antioxidants were further compared between DPSC sub-populations by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and activity assays.ResultsHigh proliferative DPSCs underwent >80PDs in culture and resisted H(2)O(2-)induced senescence (50-76PDs). In contrast, low proliferative sub-populations exhibited accelerated senescence (4-32PDs), even in untreated controls (11-34PDs). While telomere lengths were largely unaffected, certain stem cell marker expression declined with H2O2 treatment and expansion. Elevated senescence susceptibilities in low proliferative DPSC (2-10PDs) were accompanied by increased oxidative damage, absent in high proliferative DPSCs until 45-60PDs. Increased SOD2/glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) expression and SOD activities were identified in high proliferative DPSCs (10-25PDs), which declined during expansion. Low proliferative DPSCs (2-10PDs) exhibited inferior SOD, catalase and glutathione-related antioxidant expression/activities.ConclusionsSignificant variations exist in the susceptibilities of DPSC sub-populations to oxidative damage and premature senescence, contributed to by differential SOD2 and GSTZ1 profiles which maintain senescence-resistance/stemness properties in high proliferative DPSCs. Identification of superior antioxidant properties in high proliferative DPSCs enhances our understanding of DPSC biology and senescence, which may be exploited for selective sub-population screening/isolation from dental pulp tissues for regenerative medicine-based applications.

Thus, deeper understanding and characterization of GSCs is indispensable to find suitable targets and develop more effective therapies. In the present study, we applied native glioblastoma cells and GSCs sequencing, screened for GSC-specific targets and checked if the signature is related to GBM patient pathological, clinical data as well as molecular subtypes applying TCGA cohort. Data analysis revealed that tumors of proneural and mesenchymal subtypes are branching in separate clusters based on screened gene expression. Samples of the same subtype revealed significantly different patient survival prognosis as well as recurrence chance between the clusters. Recently, different subpopulations of mesenchymal GSC demonstrating different properties were shown, which indicates possible internal heterogeneity of GBM subtypes as well. Current findings also revealed branching of molecular GBM subtypes that were significantly linked to patient outcome and that might be decided by distinct GSC subpopulations.

Spectrum of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Phenotypes in Circulating Tumour Cells from Early Breast Cancer Patients	CANCERS												Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) can provide valuable prognostic information in a number of epithelial cancers. However, their detection is hampered due to their molecular heterogeneity, which can be induced by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Therefore, current knowledge about CTCs from clinical samples is often limited due to an inability to isolate wide spectrum of CTCs phenotypes. In the current work, we aimed at isolation and molecular characterization of CTCs with different EMT status in order to establish their clinical significance in early breast cancer patients. We have obtained CTCs-enriched blood fraction from 83 breast cancer patients in which we have tested the expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and general breast cancer CTCs markers (MGB1/HER2/CK19/CDH1/CDH2/VIM/PLS3), cancer stem cell markers (CD44, NANOG, ALDH1, OCT-4, CD133) and cluster formation gene (plakoglobin). We have shown that in the CTCs-positive patients, epithelial, epithelial-mesenchymal and mesenchymal CTCs markers were detected at a similar rate (in 28%, 24% and 24%, respectively). Mesenchymal CTCs were characterized by the most aggressive phenotype (significantly higher expression of CXCR4, uPAR, CD44, NANOG, p < 0.05 for all), presence of lymph node metastases (p = 0.043), larger tumour size (p = 0.023) and 7.33 higher risk of death in the multivariate analysis (95% CI 1.06-50.41, p = 0.04). Epithelial-mesenchymal subtype, believed to correspond to highly plastic and aggressive state, did not show significant impact on survival. Gene expression profile of samples with epithelial-mesenchymal CTCs group resembled pure epithelial or pure mesenchymal phenotypes, possibly underlining degree of EMT activation in particular patient's sample. Molecular profiling of CTCs EMT phenotype provides more detailed and clinically informative results, proving the role of EMT in malignant cancer progression in early breast cancer.

Their ability to regenerate bone, fat, and cartilage, modulate the immune system, and nurture the growth and function of other bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells have all been evaluated by transplant applications of MSCs. These applications require the isolation and expansion scaled cell production. To investigate biophysical properties of MSCs that can be feasibly utilized as predictors of bioactivity during biomanufacturing, we used a low-density seeding model to drive MSCs into proliferative stress and exhibit the hallmark characteristics of in vitro aging. A low-density seeding method was used to generate MSCs from passages 1-7 to simulate serial expansion of these cells to maximize yield from a single donor. MSCs were subjected to three bioactivity assays in parallel to ascertain whether patterns in MSC age, size, and shape were associated with the outcomes of the potency assays. MSC age was found to be a predictor of adipogenesis, while cell and nuclear shape was strongly associated to hematopoietic-supportive potency. Together, these data evaluate morphological changes associated with cell potency and highlight new strategies for purification or alternatives to assessing MSC quality.

However, the differentiation mechanisms of these cells have not been elucidated due to a lack of appropriate culture methods. Here, we established a culture condition for maintaining multipotent tumor cells from rat breast tumors using 4 small molecules. Cultured tumor cells in this condition retained their intrinsic myoepithelial features, expressing p63 and CK14 and vimentin. In a xenograft model, the p63-expressing cells formed epithelial tumors containing glandular, squamous and sebaceous compartments. Upon withdrawal of the small molecules, p63 and CK14 expression was lost, with concurrent increase in expression of mesenchymal markers. These transited cells acquired drug resistance and invasiveness and showed massive sarco-matoid tumorigenicity. Epithelial features could not be recovered by re-exposure to the small molecules in the transited cells. Here, we have identified multipotent cancer cells within primary mammary tumors and demonstrated that their plasticity is maintained by the small molecules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The advances in molecular biology and other technologies have led to the knowledge that a breast cancer tumor is comprised of multiple cellular entities. Here we review the two theories that have been described, trying to explain the origin of intra-tumor heterogeneity: clonal evolution and cancer stem cells. The first one considers that a single cell gives rise to many subpopulations through the accumulation of multiple aberrations, while the cancer stem cells theory foresees a hierarchical tumor evolution where only a few cells with self-renewal capacity give rise to different subpopulations. We also analyze the genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironment contributions to breast cancer intra-tumor heterogeneity. Finally, the clinical and therapeutic impact of intra-tumor heterogeneity on the outcome of breast cancer patients is discussed.				de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez, Maria/C-4722-2008; ESPARZA-LOPEZ, JOSE/AAQ-7199-2021	de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez, Maria/0000-0003-3623-1903; ESPARZA-LOPEZ, JOSE/0000-0003-3701-6607												0034-8376	2564-8896				MAR-APR	2017	69	2					66	76									WOS:000401309900003	28453505

Derivation of SMCs from different origins will provide valuable in vitro models for the investigation of vascular development and diseases. From the perspective of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, an expandable cell source of SMCs is required for the construction of tissue-engineered blood vessels. In this study, we developed a robust protocol to derive neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). NCSCs derived from ESCs and iPSCs were expandable with similar cell doubling times. NCSCs were capable of differentiating into neural and mesenchymal lineages. TGF-beta 1 induced the expression of SMC markers calponin-1, SM22 alpha, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and resulted in the assembly of smooth muscle alpha-actin, calponin-1, and SM22 alpha into stress fibers. This work provides a basis for using iPSCs to study SMC biology and deriving vascular cells for tissue engineering. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

ANTI-CANCER AGENTS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY												Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process that allows well-differentiated, polarized epithelial cells to undergo a conversion to motile, unpolarized mesenchymal cells. EMT plays crucial roles during implantation, embryogenesis, and organ development (Type 1 EMT), is associated with tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis (Type 2 EMT), and involved in cancer invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance (Type 3 EMT). Since aggressiveness and drug resistance are hallmarks of ductal pancreatic cancer, significant effort has been undertaken in recent years to elucidate molecular EMT mechanisms in this dismal malignancy. This represents a formidable challenge for several reasons: EMT is a dynamic process, both with regard to spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Moreover, EMT is induced and regulated by a complex network of traditional signaling pathways and new players like microRNAs. Interestingly, similar molecular characteristics link EMT-type cells also to the concept of cancer stem cells. This review tries to integrate the current knowledge regarding EMT and pancreatic cancer; furthermore to outline not only the perspective on novel EMT-associated therapeutic targets, but also on overcoming drug resistance by interfering with EMT.																	1871-5206	1875-5992				JUN	2011	11	5					448	454									WOS:000291638700007	21492078

Bone marrow NG2(+)/Nestin(+) mesenchymal stem cells drive DTC dormancy via TGF-beta 2	NATURE CANCER												Aguirre-Ghiso and colleagues report that bone-marrow-resident mesenchymal stem cells promote cancer dormancy through TGF-beta family members. In the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where breast cancer (BC)-disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) can remain dormant for decades, NG2(+)/Nestin(+) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. Here we reveal that periarteriolar BM-resident NG2(+)/Nestin(+) MSCs can also instruct BC DTCs to enter dormancy. NG2(+)/Nestin(+) MSCs produce transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)7 and activate a quiescence pathway dependent on TGFBRIII and BMPRII, which via p38-kinase, results in p27 induction. Genetic depletion of MSCs or conditional knockout of TGF-beta 2 in MSCs using an NG2-Cre(ER) driver led to bone metastatic outgrowth of otherwise dormant p27(+)/Ki67(-) DTCs. Also, patients with estrogen receptor-positive BC without systemic recurrence displayed higher frequency of TGF-beta 2 and BMP7 detection in the BM. Our results provide direct proof that hematopoietic stem cell dormancy niches control BC DTC dormancy and suggest that aging or extrinsic factors that affect the NG2(+)/Nestin(+) MSC niche homeostasis may result in a break from dormancy and BC bone relapse.

Phenotypic characterization of heterogeneous cell subsets in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from fat tissues by flow cytometry was also limited to a combination of few molecules. This study, therefore, developed a polychromatic staining panel for an in-depth characterization of freshly isolated SVF and expanded adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) from the patients. ADSC were found predominant in SVF (similar to 65% of CD45(-)cells) with a homogenous phenotype of CD13(+)CD31(-)CD34(+)CD45(-)CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(-)CD146(-)(similar to 94% of total ADSC). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and pericytes were minor (similar to 18% and similar to 11% of CD45(-)cells, respectively) with large heterogeneity. Downregulation of CD34 and upregulation of CD105 in ADSC were profound at passage 3, showing a phenotype similar to the classical mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow. Results from this study demonstrated that fat tissue collected from patients contains ADSC with a highly homogenous phenotype. Thein vitroculture of these cells maintained their homogeneity with modified CD34 and CD105 expression, suggesting the expansion from a single population of ADSC.

Here we generated RAP1-deficient human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by using CRISPR/Cas9 technique and obtained RAP1-deficient human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and neural stem cells (hNSCs) via directed differentiation. In both hMSCs and hNSCs, RAP1 not only negatively regulated telomere length but also acted as a transcriptional regulator of RELN by tuning the methylation status of its gene promoter. RAP1 deficiency enhanced self-renewal and delayed senescence in hMSCs, but not in hNSCs, suggesting complicated lineage-specific effects of RAP1 in adult stem cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate for the first time that RAP1 plays both telomeric and nontelomeric roles in regulating human stem cell homeostasis.

In this article, we show the feasibility and clinical value of RNA sequencing of CTCs at the single-cell level by exploiting CTC-FIND with SMART-Seq v4 technologies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). CTCs were classified by epithelial, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stem cell-related gene expression. A patient who had EMT gene expressing CTCs showed significantly shorter PFS and OS regardless of epithelial CTCs presence. Therefore, the presence of CTCs expressing EMT-related genes at the single-cell level may be ofprognostic value and a potential biomarker for risk stratification in patients with refractory mCRC who are considered to have highly heterogeneous features.</p> <br></p> Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a prognostic marker in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, little is known about the characterization of CTCs in mCRC at the single-cell level using RNA sequencing. The purpose of this study was to validate the capability to detect and isolate single CTCs for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and to identify clinical significance at a single CTC level. Methods: Single CTCs from 27 mCRC patients were collected by CTC-FIND, which is comprised of filter separation and immunomagnetic depletion to collect ultra-pure CTC samples. To address tumor heterogeneity, CTCs were collected without relying on any traditional CTC markers, such as epithelial and mesenchymal cell antigens, and were undertaken by scRNA-seq using SMART-Seq v4. Results: We identified 59 single CTCs which were classified into four groups by epithelial, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell-related gene expression. Patients receiving second or later-line treatment who had EMT gene expressing CTCs had a significantly shorter PFS and OS. Conclusions: Exploiting CTC-FIND with SMART-Seq v4 showed that scRNA-seq of CTCs may shed new insight into tumor heterogeneity of mCRC and that the presence of CTCs expressing EMT-related genes at the single-cell level could have prognostic value in mCRC patients.</p>																		2072-6694				OCT	2021	13	19							4862	10.3390/cancers13194862							WOS:000717387800001	34638346

Increasing evidence has identified a rare population of cells with stem cell-like properties in breast cancer. These cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation, contribute significantly to tumor progression, recurrence, drug resistance and metastasis. Clarifying the mechanisms regulating breast CSCs has important implications for our understanding of breast cancer progression and therapeutics. A strong connection has been found between breast CSCs and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, recent studies suggest that the maintenance of the breast CSC phenotype is associated with epigenetic and metabolic regulation. In this review, we focus on recent discoveries about the connection between EMT and CSC, and advances made in understanding the roles and mechanisms of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming in controlling breast CSC properties.																	1673-1581	1862-1783				JAN	2015	16	1					10	17		10.1631/jzus.B1400172							WOS:000348342800002	25559951

Gene expression profiling distinguishes proneural glioma stem cells from mesenchymal glioma stem cells	GENOMICS DATA												Tumor heterogeneity of high-grade glioma (HGG) is recognized by four clinically relevant subtypes based on core gene signatures. However, molecular signaling in glioma stem cells (GSCs) in individual HGG subtypes is poorly characterized. Previously we identified and characterized two mutually exclusive GSC subtypes with distinct activated signaling pathways and biological phenotypes. One GSC subtype presented with a gene signature resembling Proneural (PN) HGG, whereas the other was similar to mesenchymal (Mes) HGG. Classical HGG-derived GSCs were sub-classified as either one of these two subtypes. Differential mRNA expression analysis of PN and Mes GSCs identified 5796 differentially expressed genes, revealing a pronounced correlation with the corresponding PN or Mes HGGs. Mes GSCs displayed more aggressive phenotypes in vitro and as intracranial xenografts in mice. Further, Mes GSCs were markedly resistant to radiation compared with PN GSCs. Expression of ALDH1A3 - one of the most up-regulated Mes representative genes and a universal cancer stem cell marker in non-brain cancers - was associated with self-renewal and a multi-potent stem cell population in Mes but not PN samples. Moreover, inhibition of ALDH1A3 attenuated the growth of Mes but not PN GSCs in vitro. Lastly, radiation treatment of PN GSCs up-regulated Mes-associated markers and down-regulated PN-associated markers, whereas inhibition of ALDH1A3 attenuated an irradiation-induced gain of Mes identity in PN GSCs in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that two subtypes of GSCs, harboring distinct metabolic signaling pathways, represent intertumoral glioma heterogeneity and highlight previously unidentified roles of ALDH1A3-associated signaling that promotes aberrant proliferation of Mes HGGs and GSCs. Inhibition of ALDH1A3-mediated pathways therefore might provide a promising therapeutic approach for a subset of HGGs with the Mes signature. Here, we describe the gene expression analysis, including pre-processing methods for the data published by Mao and colleagues in PNAS [1], integration of microarray data from this study with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma data and also with another published study.

In this study, we show that at least two distinct subsets of MSCs with different adherence to plastic surface exist in human adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF); while 69% of total colony forming units in SVF adhere to the surface before 3 hrs of plating, 13-17% of colonogenic cells adhered to the surface at later period of 15 hr to 1 week after plating. Of note, the late adherent MSCs exhibited higher self-renewal of colony forming cells and higher proliferating potential with comparable level of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation potential to the early adherence subsets. Moreover, late adherent cells exhibited distinct pattern of paracrine secretome including higher level secretion of cytokines than the early adherent subsets. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that distinct adherence properties of MSCs can be another parameter of clonal heterogeneity in the subpopulations of adipose tissue MSCs and that it can be an important factor for optimization of MSC preparation for cell therapeutic trials.

Heterogeneity in Studies of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells to Treat or Prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease: A Scoping Review of the Evidence	BIOLOGY OF BLOOD AND MARROW TRANSPLANTATION												Effective treatments are lacking for the treatment of steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have demonstrated promise but there is uncertainty regarding their clinical effectiveness. A systematic scoping review of the literature was performed to characterize the heterogeneity of published studies and identify opportunities for standardization. Thirty studies were identified, including 19 studies (507 patients) addressing the treatment of acute or chronic GVHD and 11 prevention studies (277 patients). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the age and diagnoses of study subjects, intensity and specifics of the conditioning regimens, degree of HLA matching, and source of hematopoietic cells. MSCs were derived from bone marrow (83% of studies), cord blood (13%), or adipose tissue (3%) and were cryopreserved from third-party allogeneic donors in the majority of studies (91% of prevention studies and 63% of treatment studies). Culture conditions and media supplements were highly variable and characterization of MSCs did not conform to all International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria in any study. MSCs were harvested from cell culture at passage 1 to 7 and the dosage of MSCs ranged from 0.3 to 10 x 10(6)/kg, using varying schedules of administration. Treatment response criteria were not standardized and effectiveness in controlled treatment studies (5 studies) was unconvincing. Details of actively recruiting trials suggest heterogeneity still persists with only 53% of registered trials describing the use of standard GVHD response criteria and few detailing methods of MSC manufacturing. Future studies will need to make substantial coordinated efforts to reduce study heterogeneity and clarify the role of MSCs in GVHD.

Nonetheless, progress has been hampered by their enormous phenotypic as well as functional heterogeneity and the lack of uniform standards and guidelines for quality control. In this study, we describe a method to perform cellular phenotyping by high-throughput RNA interference in primary human bone marrow MSCs. We have shown that despite heterogeneity of MSC populations, robust functional assays can be established that are suitable for high-throughput and high-content screening. We profiled primary human MSCs against human fibroblasts. Network analysis showed a kinome fingerprint that differs from human primary fibroblasts as well as fibroblast cell lines. In conclusion, this study shows that high-throughput screening in primary human MSCs can be reliably used for kinome fingerprinting.

Foam morphologies can be controlled by polymerization conditions to result in either open or closed pore structures with different levels of connectivity, consequently enabling the comparison between 2D and 3D matrices using the same substrate with identical surface chemistry conditions. Additionally, here we achieve the control of pore surface topology (i.e. how different ligands are clustered together) using amphiphilic block copolymers as emulsion stabilizers. We demonstrate that adhesion of human mesenchymal progenitor (hES-MP) cells cultured on polyHIPE foams is dependent on foam surface topology and chemistry but is independent of porosity and interconnectivity. We also demonstrate that the interconnectivity, architecture and surface topology of the foams has an effect on the osteogenic differentiation potential of hES-MP cells. Together these data demonstrate that the adhesive heterogeneity of a 3D scaffold could regulate not only mesenchymal stem cell attachment but also cell behavior in the absence of soluble growth factors.

Cardiac myxoma cells exhibit embryonic endocardial stem cell features	JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY												The origin of myxoma, the most frequent tumour of the heart, remains uncertain. Previous phenotypic characterizations have shown heterogeneous results and the most recent hypothesis suggests that cardiac myxoma originates from a primitive pluripotential cardiogenic cell. We investigated the expression of actin isoforms in 30 left atrial myxomas by immunohistochemistry and in eight consecutive tumours by RT-PCR. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein and/or transcripts were detected in all cases, whereas alpha-cardiac actin was observed in few cases and alpha-skeletal actin was always absent. Besides classical features, vessel-like structures were characterized by cells expressing CD34 and, less frequently, alpha-SMA. Confocal microscopy showed focal co-expression of CD34 and alpha-SMA in myxoma cells, suggesting a gradual loss of stem endothelial markers and the acquisition of myocytic antigens. In order to confirm this hypothesis, early cardiac differentiation markers were also investigated. RT-PCR documented the presence of transcripts for Sox9 (100%), Notch1 (87.5%), NFATc1 (37.5%), Smad6, metalloproteinases 1 and 2 alone or in variable combinations and the absence of ErbB3 and WT1. Myxoma cells maintained phenotypic heterogeneity in vitro, including the expression of alpha-SMA and the presence of stress fibres. These findings document in cardiac myxoma cells phenotypic markers of the embryonic endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation that precedes terminal differentiation of endocardial cushions, supporting the hypothesis that cardiac myxonia cells may derive from adult developmental remnants.

Bladder Cancer Stem Cells: Biological and Therapeutic Perspectives	CURRENT STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Bladder cancer stem cell research is rapidly expanding based on the knowledge of cancer stem cells from various cancer types and normal stem cells as models. In various cancer types, cancer stem cells have been implicated in therapeutic resistance and relapse after initial therapy. Understanding how cancer stem cells differ from bulk cancer cells and how cancer stem cells contribute to relapse and resistance are essential to develop novel therapeutics to target cancer stem cells effectively. Here we review the latest information on bladder cancer stem cells, their biological characteristics, including their response to treatment, recurrence, immune context and technical problems encountered in bladder cancer stem cell research.

Onset of heterogeneity in culture-expanded bone marrow stromal cells	STEM CELL RESEARCH												Inconsistencies among in vitro and in vivo experiments using adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) confound development of therapeutic, regenerative medicine applications, and in vitro expansion is typically required to achieve sufficient cell numbers for basic research or clinical trials. Though heterogeneity in both morphology and differentiation capacity of culture-expanded cells is noted, sources and consequences are not well understood. Here, we endeavored to observe the onset of population heterogeneity by conducting long-term continuous in vitro observation of human adult bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) populations, a subset of which has been shown to be stem cells (also known as bone marrow-derived MSCs). Semi-automated identification and tracking of cell division and migration enabled construction of cell lineage maps that incorporated cell morphology. We found that all BMSCs steadily grew larger over time; this growth was interrupted only when a cell divided, producing two equally sized, morphologically similar daughter cells. However, a finite probability existed that one or both of these daughters then continued to increase in size without dividing, apparently exiting the cell cycle. Thus, larger BMSCs are those cells that have exited the normal cell cycle. These results hold important implications for MSC in vitro culture expansion and biophysical sorting strategies.

Here, we show that expression of miR-34a was decreased in a graded manner in glioma and glioma stem cell-lines as compared to normal brain tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-34a in glioma stem cell-lines HNGC-2 and NSG-K16 decreased the proliferative and migratory potential of these cells, induced cell cycle arrest and caused apoptosis. Notably, the miR-34a glioma cells formed significantly smaller xenografts in immuno-deficient mice as compared with control glioma stem cell-lines. Here, using a bioinformatics approach and various biological assays, we identify Rictor, as a novel target for miR-34a in glioma stem cells. Rictor, a defining component of mTORC2 complex, is involved in cell survival signaling. mTORC2 lays downstream of Akt, and thus is a direct activator of Akt. Our earlier studies have elaborated on role of Rictor in glioma invasion (Das et al., 2011). Here, we demonstrate that miR34a over-expression in glioma stem cells profoundly decreased levels of p-AKT (Ser473), increased GSK-3b levels and targeted for degradation beta-catenin, an important mediator of Wnt signaling pathway. This led to diminished levels of the Wnt effectors cyclin D1 and c-myc. Collectively, we show that the tumor suppressive function of miR-34a in glioblastoma is mediated via Rictor, which through its effects on AKT/mTOR pathway and Wnt signaling causes pronounced effects on glioma malignancy.

Also, the application of subpopulations of MSCs in cartilage regeneration remains poorly characterized. CD146(+) MSCs are identified as the natural ancestors of MSCs and the expression of CD146 are indicative of greater pluripotency and self-renewal potential. Here, we sorted a CD146(+) subpopulation from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) for cartilage regeneration. Methods: CD146(+) ADSCs were sorted using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). Cell surface markers, viability, apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated in vitro. The molecular signatures were analyzed by mRNA and protein expression profiling. By intra-articular injections of cells in a rat osteochondral defect model, we assessed the role of the specific subpopulation in cartilage microenvironment. Finally, CD146(+) ADSCs were combined with articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ACECM) scaffold for long term (3, 6 months) cartilage repair. Results: The enriched CD146(+) ADSCs showed a high expression of stem cell and pericyte markers, good viability, and immune characteristics to avoid allogeneic rejection. Gene and protein expression profiles revealed that the CD146(+) ADSCs had different cellular functions especially in regulation inflammation. In a rat model, CD146(+) ADSCs showed a better inflammation-modulating property in the early stage of intra-articular injections. Importantly, CD146(+) ADSCs exhibited good biocompatibility with the ACECM scaffold and the CD146(+) cell-scaffold composites produced less subcutaneous inflammation. The combination of CD146(+) ADSCs with ACECM scaffold can promote better cartilage regeneration in the long term. Conclusion: Our data elucidated the function of the CD146(+) ADSC subpopulation, established their role in promoting cartilage repair, and highlighted the significance of cell subpopulations as a novel therapeutic for cartilage regeneration.

The CSC model assumes that this subpopulation of cells sustains malignant growth, which suggests a hierarchical organization of tumors in which CSCs are on top and responsible for the generation of intratumoral heterogeneity. Effective tumor therapy requires the eradication of CSC as they can support regrowth of the tumor resulting in recurrence. However, eradication of CSC is difficult because they frequently are therapy resistant. Therapy resistance is mediated by the acquisition of dormancy, increased DNA repair and drug efflux capacity, decreased apoptosis as well as the interaction between CSC and their supporting micro-environment, the CSC niche. This review highlights the role of CSC in chemo- and radiotherapy resistance as well as possible ways to overcome CSC mediated therapy resistance.

Tumor cell heterogeneity, the presence of multiple types of cancer cells within a tumor, can increase cell proliferation and invasion through cooperative interactions, increasing the potential for metastasis. We recently found that pro-invasion cancer cells express the protein fibronectin and increase metastasis for pro-growth cancer cells. We investigated this interaction by analyzing these two cell types' migration and survival, both alone and in co-cultures. We find that pro-invasion cells have a protective effect on pro-growth cells, which otherwise die after two days in nutrient-starved conditions. Further, we find that adding soluble fibronectin to pro-growth cells in culture was sufficient to improve survival. However, their survival was higher for co-culturing conditions. These studies highlight the importance of cancer cell heterogeneity and the role of fibronectin in metastasis. Tumor metastasis is connected to epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity (EMH) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the tumor microenvironment. Mesenchymal-like fibronectin (FN) expressing tumor cells enhance metastasis within tumors that have EMH. However, the secondary tumors are primarily composed of the FN null population. Interestingly, during tumor cell dissemination, the invasive front has more mesenchymal-like characteristics, although the outgrowths of metastatic colonies consist of a more epithelial-like population of cells. We hypothesize that soluble FN provided by mesenchymal-like tumor cells plays a role in supporting the survival of the more epithelial-like tumor cells within the metastatic niche in a paracrine manner. Furthermore, due to a lower rate of proliferation, the mesenchymal-like tumor cells become a minority population within the metastatic niche. In this study, we utilized a multi-parametric cell-tracking algorithm and immunoblotting to evaluate the effect of EMH on the growth and invasion of an isogenic cell series within a 3D collagen network using a microfluidic platform. Using the MCF10A progression series, we demonstrated that co-culture with FN-expressing MCF10CA1h cells significantly enhanced the survival of the more epithelial MCF10CA1a cells, with a two-fold increase in the population after 5 days in co-culture, whereas the population of the MCF10CA1a cells began to decrease after 2.5 days when cultured alone (p< 0.001). However, co-culture did not significantly alter the rate of proliferation for the more mesenchymal MCF10CA1h cells. Epithelial tumor cells not only showed prolonged survival, but migrated significantly longer distances (350 mu m compared with 150 mu m, respectively,p< 0.01) and with greater velocity magnitude (4.5 mu m/h compared with 2.1 mu m/h, respectively,p< 0.001) under co-culture conditions and in response to exogenously administered FN. Genetic depletion of FN from the MCF10CA1h cells resulted in a loss of survival and migration capacity of the epithelial and mesenchymal populations. These data suggest that mesenchymal tumor cells may function to support the survival and outgrowth of more epithelial tumor cells within the metastatic niche and that inhibition of FN production may provide a valuable target for treating metastatic disease.				; Shinde, Aparna/AAN-7813-2020; Vlachos, Pavlos P/G-3779-2010	Libring, Sarah/0000-0001-8336-5862; Wendt, Mike/0000-0002-3665-7413; Shinde, Aparna/0000-0002-0822-1313; Guo, Tianqi/0000-0002-1690-5897; Chanda, Monica/0000-0003-1232-7759; Vlachos, Pavlos P/0000-0002-8040-9257													2072-6694				SEP	2020	12	9							2553	10.3390/cancers12092553							WOS:000579950000001	32911713

Human-specific RNA analysis shows uncoupled epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in circulating and disseminated tumour cells from human breast cancer xenografts	CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS												Blood samples, bone marrow, tumours and metastases where possible were collected from SCID mice bearing orthotopic xenografts of the triple-negative MDA-MB-468 cell line or a transplantable ER-positive patient derived xenograft (ED-03), and assessed using human-specific, tandem-nested RT-qPCR for markers relating to detection of circulating (CTCs) and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs), breast cancer clinicopathology, the 'cancer stem cell' phenotype, metabolism, hypoxia and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). Increased levels of SNAI1, ILK, NOTCH1, CK20, and PGR, and a decrease/loss of EPCAM in CTCs/DTCs were observed relative to the primary xenograft across both models. Decreased CD24 and EGFR was restricted to the MDA-MB-468 model, while increased TFF1 was seen in the ED-03 model. The major metabolic regulator PPARGC1A, and several hypoxia-related markers (HIF1A, APLN and BNIP3) were significantly elevated in both models. Increased expression of mesenchymal markers including SNAI1 was seen across both models, however CDH1 did not decrease concordantly, and several other epithelial markers were increased, suggesting an uncoupling of EMP to produce an EMP hybrid or partial-EMT. Single cell analysis of ED-03 CTCs, although limited, indicated uncoupling of the EMP axis in single hybrid cells, rather than distinct pools of epithelial or mesenchymal-enriched cells, however dynamic heterogeneity between CTCs/DTCs cannot be ruled out. Reduced CD24 expression was observed in the MDA-MB-468 CTCs, consistent with the 'breast cancer stem cell' phenotype, and metastatic deposits in this model mostly resembled the primary xenografts, consistent with the mesenchymal-epithelial transition paradigm.

However, their heterogeneity may be a hurdle to the achievement of reproducible and predictable therapeutic outcomes. To get a better knowledge about this heterogeneity, we designed a flow cytometric strategy to analyze the phenotype of DP cells in vivo and upon in vitro expansion with stem cell markers. We focused on the CD31(-) cell population to exclude endothelial and leukocytic cells. Results showed that the in vivo CD31(-) DP cell population contained 1.4% of CD56(+), 1.5% of CD146(+), 2.4% of CD271(+) and 6.3% of MSCA-1(+) cells but very few Stro-1(+) cells (<= 1%). CD56(+), CD146(+), CD271(+), and MSCA-1(+) cell subpopulations expressed various levels of these markers. CD146(+)MSCA-1(+), CD271(+)MSCA-1(+), and CD146(+)CD271(+) cells were the most abundant DP-MSC populations. Analysis of DP-MSCs expanded in vitro with a medicinal manufacturing approach showed that CD146 was expressed by about 50% of CD56(+), CD271(+), MSCA-1(+), and Stro-1(+) cells, and MSCA-1 by 15-30% of CD56(+), CD146(+), CD271(+), and Stro-1(+) cells. These ratios remained stable with passages. CD271 and Stro-1 were expressed by,,1% of the expanded cell populations. Interestingly, the percentage of CD56 (+) cells strongly increased from P1 (25%) to P4 (80%) both in all sub-populations studied. CD146(+)CD56(+), MSCA-1(+)CD56(+), and CD146(+)MSCA-1(+) cells were the most abundant DP MSCs at the end of P4. These results established that DP-MSCs constitute a heterogeneous mixture of cells in pulp tissue in vivo and in culture, and that their phenotype is modified upon in vitro expansion. Further studies are needed to determine whether co expression of specific MSC markers confers DP cells specific properties that could be used for the regeneration of human tissues, including the dental pulp, with standardized cell-based medicinal products.

Functional expression of adrenoreceptors in mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the human adipose tissue	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH												Cultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from different sources represent a heterogeneous population of proliferating non-differentiated cells that contains multipotent stem cells capable of originating a variety of mesenchymal cell lineages. Despite tremendous progress in MSC biology spurred by their therapeutic potential, current knowledge on receptor and signaling systems of MSCs is mediocre. Here we isolated MSCs from the human adipose tissue and assayed their responsivity to GPCR agonists with Ca2+ imaging. As a whole, a MSC population exhibited functional heterogeneity. Although a variety of first messengers was capable of stimulating Ca2+ signaling in MSCs, only a relatively small group of cells was specifically responsive to the particular GPCR agonist, including noradrenaline. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry revealed expression of alpha 1B-, alpha 2A-, and beta 2-adrenoreceptors in MSCs. Their sensitivity to subtype-specific adrenergic agonists/antagonists and certain inhibitors of Ca2+ signaling indicated that largely the alpha 2A-isoform coupled to PLC endowed MSCs with sensitivity to noradrenaline. The all-or-nothing dose-dependence was characteristic of responsivity of robust adrenergic MSCs. Noradrenaline never elicited small or intermediate responses but initiated large and quite similar Ca2+ transients at all concentrations above the threshold. The inhibitory analysis and Ca2+ uncaging implicated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in shaping Ca2+ signals elicited by noradrenaline. Evidence favored IP3 receptors as predominantly responsible for CICR. Based on the overall findings, we inferred that adrenergic transduction in MSCs includes two fundamentally different stages: noradrenaline initially triggers a local and relatively small Ca2+ signal, which next stimulates CICR, thereby being converted into a global Ca2+ signal.

J	Huang, ZJ; Wu, TT; Liu, AY; Ouyang, GL				Huang, Zhengjie; Wu, Tiantian; Liu, Allan Yi; Ouyang, Gaoliang			Differentiation and transdifferentiation potentials of cancer stem cells	ONCOTARGET												Tumor cells actively contribute to constructing their own microenvironment during tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The tumor microenvironment contains multiple types of stromal cells that work together with the extracellular matrix and local and systemic factors to coordinately contribute to tumor initiation and progression. Tumor cells and their stromal compartments acquire many genetic and/or epigenetic alternations to facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept has been widely applied to interpreting tumor initiation, growth, metastasis, dormancy and relapse. CSCs have differentiation abilities to generate the original lineage cells that are similar to their normal stem cell counterparts. Interestingly, recent evidence demonstrates that CSCs also have the potential to transdifferentiate into vascular endothelial cells and pericytes, indicating that CSCs can transdifferentiate into other lineage cells for promoting tumor growth and metastasis in some tissue contexts instead of only recruiting stromal cells from local or distant tissues. Although the transdifferentiation of CSCs into tumor stromal cells provides a new dimension that explains tumor heterogeneity, many aspects of CSC transdifferentiation remain elusive. In this review, we summarize the multi-lineage differentiation and transdifferentiation potentials of CSCs as well as discuss their potential contributions to tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in tumor progression.																		1949-2553				NOV 24	2015	6	37					39550	39563		10.18632/oncotarget.6098							WOS:000366114400019	26474460

However, to reliably identify and directly isolate the in vivo counterpart of these cells is still challenging. Using the epidermal stem cell marker CD49f, we defined a CD49f(high) distinct mesenchymal subpopulation in the dermis. In vitro and in vivo differentiation assays, and transcriptome analysis demonstrated that CD49f(high) cells possess neural crest-like cell characteristics. Our results showed that the formation of hair follicle-like budding structure and the expressions of key genes regulating hair follicle development were induced when hair follicle epithelial cells were co-cultured with CD49f(high) cells. We also found that CD49f(high) cells activated Notch signaling in co-cultured hair follicle epithelial cells, whereas the inhibition of Notch signaling resulted in epidermal cyst-like spheres and loss of maintenance of hair follicle epithelial cell characteristics. Furthermore, we identified Itga7 and CD49f as an efficient biomarker panel for direct selection of CD49f(high) skin MSCs. Our results lead to a deeper understanding of heterogeneity and the function of MSCs in the skin and may facilitate potential translational applications of these cells.

Comparison of the depolarization response of human mesenchymal stem cells from different donors	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Bioelectric signaling is currently being explored as a novel regulator of cell processes in non-excitable cells. In particular, stem cells have demonstrated increasing evidence of electrophysiology-mediated regulation of stemness acquisition, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. However, in light of many reports of primary stem cell heterogeneity, it is important to characterize the variability of stem cell response to biophysical manipulations in order to assess the utility of bioelectric modulation as a universal strategy for stem cell control. In this work, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from five donors were evaluated for their response to membrane potential (V-mem) depolarization. We compared the inter-donor variability of their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential, as well as their ability to maintain a differentiated phenotype after induction. We identified the markers that responded most consistently across donors and found that calcium deposition and gene expression of bone sialoprotein, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid binding protein 4 are the preferred markers for assessing differentiation response to Vmem depolarization. We also note that since there exists variability even among some of these markers, these assays should be performed on any newly acquired hMSC population if their bioelectric properties are to be studied further.

Advanced allogeneic studies on well-established mouse genetic and disease models are hindered by difficulties in isolating murine MSC (mMSC). And mMSC prepared from different laboratories exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, this study aimed to identify and isolate a sub-population of mMSC at an early passage number with high osteogenic potential. Enrichment of mMSC was achieved by 1-hr silica incubation and negative selection. Approximately 96% of these cells synthesized osteocalcin after 28 days of osteogenic induction in vitro, and displayed a complete dynamic alteration of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity with increasing osteogenic maturation and strong mineralization. Moreover, the cells displayed uniform and stable surface molecular profile, long-term survival, fast proliferation in vitro with maintenance of normal karyotype and distinct immunological properties. CD73 was found to be expressed exclusively in osteogenesis but not in adipogenesis. These cells also retained high osteogenic potential upon allogeneic transplantation in an ectopic site by the detection of bone-specific ALP, osteopontin, osteocalcin and local mineralization as early as 12 days after implantation. Hence, these cells may provide a useful source for improving current strategies in bone regenerative therapy, and for characterizing markers defining the putative MSC population.

The first aim of the present study was to identify CD133(high)/CD44(high) DU145 prostate CSCs and compare their profiles with non-CSCs as bulk counterparts of the population. Subsequently, the two populations continued to be three-dimensional multicellular spheroids. Differentiation was then investigated with stem cell-related genomic characteristics. Polymerase chain reaction array analyses of cell cycle regulation, embryonic and mesenchymal cell lineage-related markers, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and Notch signaling were performed. Immunohistochemistry of CD117, Notch1, Jagged1, Delta1, Sox2, c-Myc, Oct4, KLF4, CD90 and SSEA1 were determined in CSC and non-CSC monolayer and spheroid subcultures. Significant gene alterations were observed in the CD133(high)/CD44(high) population when cultured as a monolayer and continued as spheroid. In this group, marked gene upregulation was determined in collagen type 9 a1, Islet1 and cyclin D2. Jagged1, Delta-like 3 and Notch1 were respectively upregulated genes in the Notch signaling pathway. According to immunoreactivity, the staining density of Jagged1, Sox2, Oct4 and Klf-4 increased significantly in CSC spheroids. Isolated CSCs alter their cellular characterization over the course of time and exhibit a differentiation profile while maintaining their former surface antigens at a level of transcription or translation. The current study suggested that this differentiation process may be a mechanism responsible for the malignant process and tumor growth.

Little is known how these cell preparations are influenced by culture media, plating density, or passaging. In this study, we have isolated MSCs from human adipose tissue in culture medium supplemented with either fetal calf serum (FCS) or human platelet lysate (HPL). In addition, culture expansion was simultaneously performed at plating densities of 10 or 10,000 cells/cm(2). The use of FCS resulted in larger cells, whereas HPL significantly enhanced proliferation. Notably, HPL also facilitated expansion for more population doublings than FCS (43 +/- 3 vs. 22 +/- 4 population doubling; p < 0.001), while plating density did not have a significant effect on long-term growth curves. To gain further insight into population dynamics, we conceived a cellular automaton model to simulate expansion of MSCS. It is based on the assumptions that the number of cell divisions is limited and that due to contact inhibition proliferation occurs only at the rim of colonies. The model predicts that low plating densities result in more heterogeneity with regard to cell division history, and favor subpopulations of higher migratory activity. In summary, HPL is a suitable serum supplement for isolation of MSC from adipose tissue and facilitates more population doublings than FCS. Cellular automaton computer simulations provided, additional insights into how complex population dynamics during long-term expansion are affected by plating density and migration.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fates are tightly regulated by humoral factors, cellular interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are complex polysaccharides with structural heterogeneity. During osteogenesis, a temporally controlled expression of particular GAG species is required to interact with specific growth promoting and differentiating factors to regulate their biological activities. As a comparative tool to study natural GAG, we used structurally and functionally related synthetic GAG mimetics. One of these compounds [OTR4120] was previously shown to stimulate bone repair in rat models. Here, we demonstrate that structurally distinct GAG mimetics stimulate differentially clonogenicity, proliferation, migration and osteogenic phenotype of MSC in vitro, according to their specific chemical signature, underlying the role of sulfate and acetyl groups in specific interactions with heparin binding factors (HBF). These effects are dependent on FGF-2 interactions since they are inhibited by a FGF receptor 1 signaling pathway blocker. These data suggest that the in vivo [OTR4120] bone regenerative effect could be due to its ability to induce MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation. To conclude, we provide evidences showing that GAG mimetics may have great interest for bone regeneration therapy and represent an alternative to exogenous growth factor treatments to optimize potential therapeutic properties of MSC.

Capturing Mesenchyrnal Stem Cell Heterogeneity during Osteogenic Differentiation: An Experimental-Modeling Approach	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH												Currently, there is an increasing clinical demand for bone implants for several orthopedic and maxillofacial surgical procedures. Meeting these demands can be achieved with stem cells differentiated in vitro toward the osteogenic lineage to produce cells suitable for implantation in critical size bone defects. Toward this end, we present a population balance model (PBM) of the osteogenic differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. Our experimental-modeling approach describes osteogenesis with a dynamic cell PBM incorporating the expression of key osteogenic genes and the activity of metabolic pathways involved in osteogenesis. In addition to accurately capturing the phenotypic heterogeneity of osteogenic differentiation, the model also predicts a delay for the onset of differentiation when the cells grow faster, thus a trade-off between proliferation and differentiation over the course of in vitro osteoinduction. The mathematical model from this work sets a solid foundation for future model-based culture or reactor optimization.

Current treatment options for OA are focused on pain management and slowing degradation of cartilage. Some modern surgical techniques aimed at encouraging regeneration at defect sites have met with limited long-term success. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been viewed recently as a potential tool in OA repair due to their chondrogenic capacity. Several studies have shown success with regards to reducing patient's OA-related pain and discomfort but have been less successful in inducing chondrocyte regeneration. The heterogeneity of MSCs and their limited proliferation capacity also raises issues when developing an off-theshelf treatment for OA. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which allows for the easy production of cells capable of prolonged self-renewal and producing any somatic cell type, may overcome those limitations. Patient derived iPSCs can also be used to gain new insight into heredity-related OA. Efforts to generate chondrocytes from iPSCs through embryoid bodies or mesenchymal intermediate stages have struggled to produce with optimal functional characteristics. However, iPSCs potential to produce cells for future OA therapies has been supported by iPSC-derived teratomas, which have shown an ability to produce functional, stable articular cartilage. Other iPSCschondrogenic protocols are also improving by incorporating tissue engineering techniques to better mimic developmental conditions.				; Mobasheri, Ali/D-5770-2011; Dinnyes, Andras/D-5131-2013	Kobolak, Julianna/0000-0002-0986-9517; Mobasheri, Ali/0000-0001-6261-1286; Dinnyes, Andras/0000-0003-3791-2583												0065-2598	2214-8019	978-3-319-93867-7; 978-3-319-93866-0				2018	1079						55	68		10.1007/5584_2017_141	10.1007/978-3-319-93867-7						WOS:000457208000005	29270885

To this aim we compared the hBMSC behavior when grafted onto two biomaterials allowing different bone potential in vivo. The cancellous devitalized Tutoplast (R)-processed bone (TPB) and the synthetic hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium-phos phate (HA/beta TCP) which give at 6 weeks 100% and 50% of bone formation respectively. We first showed that hBMSC adhesion is two times favored on TPB in vitro and in vivo compared to HA/beta TCP. Biomaterial structure analysis indicated that the better cell adhesion on TPB is associated to its higher and smooth open pore architecture as well as its content in collagen. Our 6 week time course analysis, showed using qPCR that only adherent cells are able to survive in vivo giving thus an advantage in term of cell number on TPB during the first 4 weeks after graft. We then showed that grafted hBMSC survival is crucial as cells participate directly to bone formation and play a paracrine action via the secretion of hIGF1 and hRANKL which are known to regulate the bone formation and resorption pathways respectively. Altogether our results point out the importance of developing a smooth and open pore scaffold to optimize hBMSC adhesion and ensure cell survival in vivo as it is a prerequisite to potentiate their direct and paracrine functions. Statement of Significance Around 10% of skeletal fractures do not heal correctly causing nonunion. An approach involving mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) associated with biomaterials emerges as an innovative strategy for bone repair. The diversity of scaffolds is a source of heterogeneity for bone formation efficiency. In order to better determine the characteristics of a powerful scaffold it is crucial to understand their relationship with cells after graft. Our results highlight that a biomaterial architecture similar to cancellous bone is important to promote MSC adhesion and ensure cell survival in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrated that the grafted MSC play a direct role coupled to a paracrine effect to enhance bone formation and that both of those roles are governed by the used scaffold.

An In Vitro Comparison of the Neurotrophic and Angiogenic Activity of Human and Canine Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs): Translating MSC-Based Therapies for Spinal Cord Injury	BIOMOLECULES												The majority of research into the effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplants on spinal cord injury (SCI) is performed in rodent models, which may help inform on mechanisms of action, but does not represent the scale and wound heterogeneity seen in human SCI. In contrast, SCI in dogs occurs naturally, is more akin to human SCI, and can be used to help address important aspects of the development of human MSC-based therapies. To enable translation to the clinic and comparison across species, we have examined the paracrine, regenerative capacity of human and canine adipose-derived MSCs in vitro. MSCs were initially phenotyped according to tissue culture plastic adherence, cluster of differentiation (CD) immunoprofiling and tri-lineage differentiation potential. Conditioned medium (CM) from MSC cultures was then assessed for its neurotrophic and angiogenic activity using established cell-based assays. MSC CM significantly increased neuronal cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, and beta III tubulin immunopositivity. In addition, MSC CM significantly increased endothelial cell migration, cell proliferation and the formation of tubule-like structures in Matrigel assays. There were no marked or significant differences in the capacity of human or canine MSC CM to stimulate neuronal cell or endothelial cell activity. Hence, this study supports the use of MSC transplants for canine SCI; furthermore, it increases understanding of how this may subsequently provide useful information and translate to MSC transplants for human SCI.

The need for in vitro propagation to obtain therapeutic quantities of the cells imposes a risk of impaired functionality due to cellular senescence. The aim of the study was to analyze in vitro senescence of previously cryopreserved human ADSCs subjected to serial passages in cell culture. Methods and Results: ADSC cultures from 8 donors were cultivated until proliferation arrest was reached. A gradual decline of ADSC fitness was observed by altered cell morphology, loss of proliferative, clonogenic and differentiation abilities and increased g-galactosidase expression all of which occurred in a donor-specific manner. Relative telomere length (RTL) analysis revealed that only three tested cultures encountered replicative senescence. The presence of two ADSC subsets with significantly different RTL and cell size was discovered. The heterogeneity of ADSC cultures was supported by the intermittent nature of aging seen in tested samples. Conclusions: We conclude that the onset of in vitro senescence of ADSCs is a strongly donor-specific process which is complicated by the intricate dynamics of cell subsets present in ADSC population. This complexity needs to be carefully considered when elaborating protocols for personalized cellular therapy.

However, most studies ascribed the function of PVAT in vascular remodeling to adipokines secreted by the perivascular adipocytes. Whether mesenchymal stem cells exist in PVAT and play a role in vascular regeneration remain unknown. Approach and Results: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allowed direct visualization of the heterogeneous PVAT-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PV-ADSCs) at a high resolution and revealed 2 distinct subpopulations, among which one featured signaling pathways crucial for smooth muscle differentiation. Pseudotime analysis of cultured PV-ADSCs unraveled their smooth muscle differentiation trajectory. Transplantation of cultured PV-ADSCs in mouse vein graft model suggested the contribution of PV-ADSCs to vascular remodeling through smooth muscle differentiation. Mechanistically, treatment with TGF-beta 1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) and transfection of microRNA (miR)-378a-3p mimics induced a similar metabolic reprogramming of PV-ADSCs, including upregulated mitochondrial potential and altered lipid levels, such as increased cholesterol and promoted smooth muscle differentiation. Conclusions: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows direct visualization of PV-ADSC heterogeneity at a single-cell level and uncovers 2 subpopulations with distinct signature genes and signaling pathways. The function of PVAT in vascular regeneration is partly attributed to PV-ADSCs and their differentiation towards smooth muscle lineage. Mechanistic study presents miR-378a-3p which is a potent regulator of metabolic reprogramming as a potential therapeutic target for vascular regeneration.

J	Majore, I; Moretti, P; Hass, R; Kasper, C				Majore, Ingrida; Moretti, Pierre; Hass, Ralf; Kasper, Cornelia			Identification of subpopulations in mesenchymal stem cell-like cultures from human umbilical cord	CELL COMMUNICATION AND SIGNALING												Background: A variety of cell types can be identified in the adherent fraction of bone marrow mononuclear cells including more primitive and embryonic-like stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), lineage-committed progenitors as well as mature cells such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Different methods are described for the isolation of single bone marrow stem cell subpopulations - beginning from ordinary size sieving, long term cultivation under specific conditions to FACS-based approaches. Besides bone marrow-derived subpopulations, also other tissues including human umbilical cord (UC) have been recently suggested to provide a potential source for MSC. Although of clinical importance, these UC-derived MSC populations remain to be characterized. It was thus the aim of the present study to identify possible subpopulations in cultures of MSC-like cells obtained from UC. We used counterflow centrifugal elutriation (CCE) as a novel strategy to successfully address this question. Results: UC-derived primary cells were separated by CCE and revealed differentially-sized populations in the fractions. Thus, a subpopulation with an average diameter of about 11 mu m and a small flat cell body was compared to a large sized subpopulation of about 19 mu m average diameter. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of certain MSC stem cell markers including CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105, respectively, although these markers were expressed at higher levels in the small-sized population. Moreover, this small-sized subpopulation exhibited a higher proliferative capacity as compared to the total UC-derived primary cultures and the large-sized cells and demonstrated a reduced amount of aging cells. Conclusion: Using the CCE technique, we were the first to demonstrate a subpopulation of small-sized UC-derived primary cells carrying MSC-like characteristics according to the presence of various mesenchymal stem cell markers. This is also supported by the high proliferative capacity of these MSC-like cells as compared to whole primary culture or other UC-derived subpopulations. The accumulation of a self-renewing MSC-like subpopulation by CCE with low expression levels of the aging marker senescence-associated beta-galactosidase provides a valuable tool in the regenerative medicine and an alternative to bone-marrow-derived MSC.

In this study, we exposed Luminal-A breast cancer cells in culture to combined "TME Stimulation", representing three typical arms of the breast TME: hormonal (estrogen), inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and growth-promoting (epidermal growth factor). In addition to enriching the tumor cell population with CD44+/beta 1+cells (as we previously published), TME Stimulation selected for CD44+/CD24(low/-) stem-like cells, that were further enriched by doxorubicin treatment and demonstrated high plasticity in vitro and in vivo. Knock-down experiments revealed that CD44 and Zeb1 regulated CD24 and beta 1 expression and controlled differently cell spreading and formation of cellular protrusions. TME-enriched CD44+/CD24(low/-) stem-like cells promoted dissemination to bones and lymph nodes, whereas CD44+/beta 1+ cells had a low metastatic potential. Mixed co-injections of TME-enriched CD44+/CD24(low/-) and CD44+/beta 1+ sub-populations generated metastases populated mostly by CD44+/CD24(low/-)- derived cells. Thus, combined activities of several TME factors select for CD44+/CD24(low/-) stem-like cells that dictate the metastatic phenotype of Luminal-A breast tumor cells, suggesting that therapeutic modalities targeting the TME could be introduced as a potential strategy of inhibiting the detrimental stem-like sub-population in this disease subtype.

However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100-300 mu m) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

J	Wechsler, ME; Hermann, BP; Bizios, R				Wechsler, Marissa E.; Hermann, Brian P.; Bizios, Rena			Adult Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation at the Cell Population and Single-Cell Levels Under Alternating Electric Current	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS												Mesenchymal stem cells, precursors that can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, have tremendous potential for derivation of cells with specific (e.g., osteogenic) phenotypes for tissue engineering and tissue regeneration applications. To date, the predominant strategy to achieve directed differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts was to recapitulate the normal developmental ontogeny of osteoblasts using growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic proteins). In contrast, the effects of biophysical stimuli alone on such outcomes remain, at best, partially understood. This in vitro study examined and optimized the effects of alternating electric current alone on the differentiation of adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) at the cell population and single-cell levels. hMSCs, cultured on flat, indium-tin-oxide-coated glass in the absence of supplemented exogenous growth factors were exposed to alternating electric current (5-40 mu A, 5-10 Hz frequency, sinusoidal waveform), for 1-24 h daily for up to 21 consecutive days. Compared to results obtained from the respective controls, hMSC populations exposed to the alternating electric current alone (in the absence of exogenous growth factors) expressed genes at various stages of differentiation (specifically, TAZ, Runx-2, Osterix, Osteopontin, and Osteocalcin). Optimal osteogenic differentiation was achieved when hMSCs were exposed to a 10 mA, 10 Hz alternating electric current for 6 h daily for up to 21 days. Exclusive osteodifferentiation was observed since genes for the chondrocyte (Collagen Type II) and adipocyte (FABP-4) lineages were not expressed under all conditions of the biophysical stimulus tested. Single cell mRNAs for 45 genes (indicative of hMSC differentiation) were monitored using Fluidigm Systems. Homogeneous expression of the early osteodifferentiation genes (specifically, TAZ and Runx-2) was observed in hMSCs exposed to the alternating electric current at 7 and 21 days. Heterogeneity for all other genes monitored was observed in hMSCs exposed to alternating electric current and in their respective controls. These results provide the first glimpse of gene expression in differentiating hMSCs at the cell population and single-cell levels and represent novel approaches for stem cell differentiation pertinent to new tissue formation.

J	Sadasivam, S; Subramanian, R				Sadasivam, Subhashini; Subramanian, Ramaswamy			A perspective on challenges and opportunities in characterizing oral cancer stem cells	FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK												Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) represent a minority population of cells in a tumor that can self-renew and re-create the heterogeneity of the entire tumor. Cell lines, patient-derived tumor cells, and patient-derived xenografts have all been used to isolate presumptive CSC populations from different tumor types. Because of their purported roles in tumor recurrence and prognosis, numerous efforts have centered around reliably identifying CSCs using cell surface markers, and in using genomics tools to identify molecular features unique to these cells. In this brief review, we will discuss different markers, CD44, ALDH1, CD271 and others that have used for identifying and isolating CSCs from primary head & neck and oral squamous cell carcinomas. In particular, we focus on the challenges associated with these experiments as this will be useful to researchers attempting similar isolations. We also discuss some important molecular features gleaned from studying these CSCs such as the expression of stem cell-related markers, loss of cell adhesion and terminal differentiation markers, and the presence of both epithelial and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features.

Visualizing Intrapopulation Hematopoietic Cell Heterogeneity with Self-Organizing Maps of SIMS Data	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS												Characterization of the heterogeneity within stem cell populations, which affects their differentiation potential, is necessary for the design of artificial cultures for stem cell expansion. In this study, we assessed whether self-organizing maps (SOMs) of single-cell time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) data provide insight into the spectral, and thus the related functional heterogeneity between and within three hematopoietic cell populations. SOMs were created of TOF-SIMS data from individual hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), lineage-committed common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and fully differentiated B cells that had been isolated from murine bone marrow via conventional flow cytometry. The positions of these cells on the SOMs and the spectral variation between adjacent map units, shown on the corresponding unified distance matrix (U-matrix), indicated the CLPs exhibited the highest intrapopulation spectral variation, regardless of the age of the donor mice. SOMs of HSPCs, CLPs, and B cells isolated from young and old mice using the same surface antigen profiles revealed the HSPCs exhibited the most age-related spectral variation, whereas B cells exhibited the least. These results demonstrate that SOMs of single-cell spectra enable characterizing the heterogeneity between and within cell populations that lie along distinct differentiation pathways.																	1937-3384	1937-3392				JUN	2018	24	6					322	330		10.1089/ten.tec.2017.0382		MAY 2018					WOS:000431593100001	29652627

The T-cell suppressive property of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has been considered a major mode of action and basis for their utilization in a number of human clinical trials. However, there is no well-established reproducible assay to measure MSC-mediated T-cell suppression. Methods. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison Production Assistance for Cellular Therapy (PACT) Center, we developed an in vitro quality control T-cell suppression immunopotency assay (IPA) that uses anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to stimulate T-cell proliferation. We measured MSC-induced suppression of CD4+ T-cell proliferation at various effector-to-target cell ratios with the use of defined peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in parallel compared with a reference standard MSC product. We calculated an IPA value for suppression of CD4+ T cells for each MSC product. Results. Eleven MSC products generated at three independent PACT centers were evaluated for cell surface phenotypic markers and T-cell suppressive properties. Flow cytometry results demonstrated typical MSC cell surface marker profiles. There was significant variability in the level of suppression of T-cell proliferation, with immunopotency assay values ranging from 27% to 88%. However, MSC suppression did not correlate with human leukocyte antigen DR expression. Conclusions. We have developed a reproducible immunopotency assay to measure allogeneic MSC-mediated suppression of CD4+ T cells. Additional studies may be warranted to determine how these in vitro assay results may correlate with other immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, in addition to evaluating the ability of this assay to predict in vivo efficacy.																	1465-3249	1477-2566				FEB	2015	17	2					140	151		10.1016/j.jcyt.2014.10.002							WOS:000348270800003	25455739

In vitro generation of Sertoli-like and haploid spermatid-like cells from human umbilical cord perivascular cells	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background: First trimester (FTM) and term human umbilical cord-derived perivascular cells (HUCPVCs), which are rich sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), can give rise to Sertoli cell (SC)-like as well as haploid germ cell (GC)-like cells in vitro using culture conditions that recapitulate the testicular niche. Gamete-like cells have been produced ex vivo using pluripotent stem cells as well as MSCs. However, the production of functional gametes from human stem cells has yet to be achieved. Methods: Three independent lines of FTM and term HUCPVCs were cultured using a novel 5-week step-wise in vitro differentiation protocol recapitulating key physiological signals involved in testicular development. SC- and GC-associated phenotypical properties were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative PCR immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). Functional spermatogonial stem cell-like properties were assessed using a xenotranplantation assay. Results: Within 3 weeks of differentiation, two morphologically distinct cell types emerged including large adherent cells and semi-attached round cells. Both early GC-associated markers (VASA, DAZL, GPR125, GFR1 alpha) and SC-associated markers (FSHR, SOX9, AMH) were upregulated, and 5.7 +/- 1.2% of these cells engrafted near the inner basal membrane in a xenograft assay. After 5 weeks in culture, 10-30% of the cells were haploid, had adopted a spermatid-like morphology, and expressed PRM1, Acrosin, and ODF2. Undifferentiated HUCPVCs secreted key factors known to regulate spermatogenesis (LIF, GDNF, BMP4, bFGF) and 10-20% of HUCPVCs co-expressed SSEA4, CD9, CD90, and CD49f. We hypothesize that the paracrine properties and cellular heterogeneity of HUCPVCs may explain their dual capacity to differentiate to both SC- and GC-like cells. Conclusions: HUCPVCs recapitulate elements of the testicular niche including their ability to differentiate into cells with Sertoli-like and haploid spermatid-like properties in vitro. Our study supports the importance of generating a niche-like environment under ex vivo conditions aiming at creating mature GC, and highlights the plasticity of HUCPVCs. This could have future applications for the treatment of some cases of male infertility.																		1757-6512				FEB 15	2017	8								37	10.1186/s13287-017-0491-8							WOS:000396976800002	28202061

However, the number of endogenous ECs is inadequate for both experimental purposes and clinical applications. Porcine ovarian putative stem cells (poPSCs), although not pluripotent, are characterized by great plasticity. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether poPSCs have the potential to differentiate into cells of endothelial lineage. poPSCs were immunomagnetically isolated from postnatal pig ovaries based on the presence of SSEA-4 protein. Expression of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) markers after pre-culture, both at the level of mRNA: ITGB1, THY, and ENG and corresponding protein: CD29, CD90, and CD105 were significantly higher compared to the control ovarian cortex cells. To differentiate poPSCs into ECs, inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied. After 14 days, poPSC differentiation into ECs was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for vascular endothelial cadherin (VECad) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Semi-quantitative WB analysis of these proteins confirmed their high abundance. Additionally, qRT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of corresponding marker genes: CDH5, KDR was significantly higher compared with undifferentiated poPSCs. Finally, EC functional status was confirmed by the migration test that revealed that they were capable of positive chemotaxis, while tube formation assay demonstrated their ability to develop capillary networks. In conclusion, our results provided evidence that poPSCs may constitute the MSC population in the ovary and confirmed that they might be a potential source of ECs for tissue engineering.

Ex Vivo Human Adipose Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (ASC) Are a Heterogeneous Population That Demonstrate Rapid Culture-Induced Changes	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY												Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) are showing clinical promise for the treatment of a range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions. These lipoaspirate-derived cells are part of the abundant and accessible source of heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction (SVF). They are typically isolated and expanded from the SVF via adherent cell culture for at least 2 weeks and as such represent a relatively undefined population of cells. We isolated ex vivo ASC directly from lipoaspirate using a cocktail of antibodies combined with immunomagnetic bead sorting. This method allowed for the rapid enrichment of a defined and untouched ex vivo ASC population (referred to as MACS-derived ASC) that were then compared to culture-derived ASC. This comparison found that MACS-derived ASC contain a greater proportion of cells with activity in in vitro differentiation assays. There were also significant differences in the secretion levels of some key paracrine molecules. Moreover, when the MACS-derived ASC were subjected to adherent tissue culture, rapid changes in gene expression were observed. This indicates that culturing cells may alter the clinical utility of these cells. Although MACS-derived ASC are more defined compared to culture-derived ASC, further investigations using a comprehensive multicolor flow cytometry panel revealed that this cell population is more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Additional studies are therefore required to more precisely delineate phenotypically distinct ASC subsets with the most therapeutic potential. This research highlights the disparity between ex vivo MACS-derived and culture-derived ASC and the need for further characterization.

Despite responding initially well to chemo- or radiotherapy, SCLC almost invariably relapses and develops resistance to chemotherapy. This is suspected to be related to tumor cell subpopulations with different characteristics resembling stem cells. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is known to play a key role in metastatic processes and in developing drug resistance. This is also true for NSCLC, but there is very little information on EMT processes in SCLC so far. SCLC, in contrast to NSCLC cell lines, grow mainly in floating cell clusters and a minor part as adherent cells. We compared these morphologically different subpopulations of SCLC cell lines for EMT and epigenetic features, detecting significant differences in the adherent subpopulations with high levels of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin and Fibronectin and very low levels of epithelial markers like E-cadherin and Zona Occludens 1. In addition, expression of EMT-related transcription factors such as Snail/Snai1, Slug/Snai2, and Zeb1, DNA methylation patterns of the EMT hallmark genes, functional responses like migration, invasion, matrix metalloproteases secretion, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drug treatment all differed significantly between the sublines. This phenotypic variability might reflect tumor cell heterogeneity and EMT during metastasis in vivo, accompanied by the development of refractory disease in relapse. We propose that epigenetic regulation plays a key role during phenotypical and functional changes in tumor cells and might therefore provide new treatment options for SCLC patients.

However, traditional isolation of BMSCs by adhesion to plastic leads to very heterogeneous cell populations, accounting for high variability of chondrogenic differentiation outcome, both across donors and across clonally derived strains. Identification of putative surface markers able to select BMSC subpopulations with higher chondrogenic capacity (CC) and reduced variance in chondrogenic differentiation could aid the development of BMSC-based cartilage and bone regeneration approaches. With the goal to identify predictive markers for chondrogenic BMSC populations, we assessed the gene expression profile of single cell-derived clones with high and low CC. While a clustering between high and low CC clones was observed for one donor, donor-to-donor variability hampered the possibility to achieve conclusive results when different donors were considered. Nevertheless, increased NCAM1/CD56 expression correlated in clones derived from one donor with higher CC, the same trend was observed for three additional donors (even if no significance was achieved). Enriching multiclonal BMSCs for CD56(+) expression led to an increase in CC, though still highly affected by donor-to-donor variability. Our study finally suggests that definition of predictive marker(s) for BMSCs chondrogenesis is challenged by the large donor heterogeneity of these cells, and by the high complexity and plasticity of the BMSCs system. Multiple pathways and external parameters may be indeed involved in determining the chondrogenic potential of BMSCs, making the identification of putative markers still an open issue.

Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising candidates for cell therapy because of their intriguing properties (high proliferation and differentiation capacity, microenvironmental function and immune modulation). However, MSC are heterogeneous and a better understanding of the heterogeneity of the cells that form the MSC cultures is critical. Methods.Human MSC were generated in standard cultures and stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) for cell division tracking. Gene expression profiling of MSC that were sorted based on functional parameters (i.e. proliferation characteristics) was utilized to characterize potential MSC subpopulations (progenitor content and differentiation capacity) and identify potential MSC subpopulation markers. Results. The majority of MSC had undergone more than two cell divisions (79.72.0%) after 10 days of culture, whereas 3.50.9% of MSC had not divided. MSC were then sorted into rapidly dividing cells (RDC) and slowly/non-dividing cells (SDC/NDC). Colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) frequencies were lowest in NDC and highest in RDC with low forward-/side-scatter properties (RDClolo). Comparative microarray analysis of NDC versus RDC identified 102 differentially expressed genes. Two of these genes (FMOD and VCAM1) corresponded to cell-surface molecules that enabled the prospective identification of a VCAM1+/FMOD+ MSC subpopulation, which increased with passage and showed very low progenitor activity and limited differentiation potential. Conclusions. These data clearly demonstrate functional differences within MSC cultures. Furthermore, this study shows that cell sorting based on proliferation characteristics and gene expression profiling can be utilized to identify surface markers for the characterization of MSC subpopulations.

The use of cell lines to model CSCs is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying and isolating cell populations that possess differences in self-renewal and tumor initiation. To overcome these barriers in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we developed a CSC system using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter for the promoter of the well-established pluripotency gene NANOG. NANOG-GFP+ cells gave rise to both GFP+ and GFP(-) cells, and GFP+ cells possessed increased levels of the embryonic stem cell transcription factors NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 and elevated self-renewal and tumor initiation capacities. GFP+ cells also expressed mesenchymal markers and demonstrated increased invasion. Compared with the well-established CSC markers CD24(-)/CD44(+), CD49f, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, our NANOG-GFP reporter system demonstrated increased enrichment for CSCs. To explore the utility of this system as a screening platform, we performed a flow cytometry screen that confirmed increased CSC marker expression in the GFP+ population and identified new cell surface markers elevated in TNBC CSCs, including junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A). JAM-A was highly expressed in GFP+ cells and patient-derived xenograft ALDH+ CSCs compared with the GFP(-) and ALDH(-) cells, respectively. Depletion of JAM-A compromised self-renewal, whereas JAM-A overexpression induced self-renewal in GFP(-) cells. Our data indicate that we have defined and developed a robust system to monitor differences between CSCs and non-CSCs in TNBC that can be used to identify CSC-specific targets for the development of future therapeutic strategies.

J	Navarro-Betancourt, JR; Hernandez, S				Navarro-Betancourt, Jose R.; Hernandez, Salomon			On the existence of cardiomesenchymal stem cells	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES												The most efficient cells for cardiac regeneration are myocardium-resident cardiac stem cells. However, the limited availability of these cells restricts their utility for cardiac cellular therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into a wide variety of tissues, but it is not simple to accurately direct cell differentiation into a specific lineage, such as cardiac tissue; this renders a low efficiency for cardiac regeneration therapy. Given the heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells, it may be possible to find specific stem cell subpopulations with a definite differentiation capacity toward cardiac lineage. A parameter to assess cardiac differentiation specificity could be surface marker expression; a population with an immunophenotype similar to cardiac stem cells may have a superior therapeutic value than unsorted mesenchymal stem cells. We hypothesize the existence of a cell line that combines the expression of cardiac stem cell surface markers with those of mesenchymal stem cells, a suitable name for this population is cardiomesenchymal stem cells (CMSC); such cells would be ideal for cardiac regeneration.

Functional Heterogeneity within the CD44 High Human Breast Cancer Stem Cell-Like Compartment Reveals a Gene Signature Predictive of Distant Metastasis	MOLECULAR MEDICINE												The CD44(hi) compartment in human breast cancer is enriched in tumor-initiating cells; however, the functional heterogeneity within this subpopulation remains poorly defined. We used a triple-negative breast cancer cell line with a known bilineage phenotype to isolate and clone CD44(hi) single cells that exhibited mesenchymal/basal B and luminal/basal A features, respectively. Herein, we demonstrate in this and other triple-negative breast cancer cell lines that, rather than CD44(hi)/CD24(-) mesenchymal-like basal B cells, the CD44(hi)/CD24(lo) epithelioid basal A cells retained classic cancer stem cell features, such as tumor-initiating capacity in vivo, mammosphere formation and resistance to standard chemotherapy. These results complement previous findings using oncogene-transformed normal mammary cells showing that only cell clones with a mesenchymal phenotype exhibit cancer stem cell features. Further, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic and gene array analyses of these cells and identified potential novel markers of breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating features, such as lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), RAB25, S100A14 and mucin 1 (MUC1), as well as a novel 31-gene signature capable of predicting distant metastasis in cohorts of estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancers. These findings strongly favor functional heterogeneity in the breast cancer cell compartment and hold promise for further refinements of prognostic marker profiling. Our work confirms that, in addition to cancer stem cells with mesenchymal-like morphology, those tumor-initiating cells with epithelial-like morphology should also be the focus of drug development.

Since human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have unique features of tumor-tropism and low immunogenicity, the purpose of this study is to use mesenchymal stem cells as carriers to deliver TYMP to cancer cells and then trigger their death by administrating doxifluridine. First, the TYMP gene sequence and core streptavidin (core SA) were constructed into pET-30a(+) plasmid. After bacterial transformation and colony screening, TYMP-SA fusion protein was expressed by IPTG induction and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and characterized by SDS-PAGE and western blot with a clear band at 75 kDa. The characterized TYMP-SA was further anchored on the cell membrane of biotinylated hMSCs via biotin-streptavidin binding. hMSCs anchored with TYMP-SA were then co-cultured with adenocarcinoma A549 cells (with different ratios) and treated with 100 mu M prodrug doxifluridine over the course of four days. Our results showed that a 2 : 1 ratio led to the eradication of A549 cells at the end of the experiment with less than 5% confluency, in comparison with the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 ratios which still had about 13% and 20% confluency respectively. In conclusion, harnessing hMSCs as cell carriers for the delivery of TYMP enzyme to cancer cells could lead to significant cell death post-treatment of the prodrug doxifluridine.

A quiescent cell population replenishes mesenchymal stem cells to drive accelerated growth in mouse incisors	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The extent to which heterogeneity within mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) populations is related to function is not understood. Using the archetypal MSC in vitro surface marker, CD90/Thy1, here we show that 30% of the MSCs in the continuously growing mouse incisor express CD90/Thy1 and these cells give rise to 30% of the differentiated cell progeny during postnatal development. In adulthood, when growth rate homeostasis is established, the CD90/Thy1(+) MSCs decrease dramatically in number. When adult incisors are cut, the growth rate increases to rapidly re-establish tooth length and homeostasis. This accelerated growth rate correlates with the re-appearance of CD90/Thy(+) MSCs and re-establishment of their contribution to cell differentiation. A population of Celsr1(+) quiescent cells becomes mitotic following clipping and replenishes the CD90/Thy1 population. A sub-population of MSCs thus exists in the mouse incisor, distinguished by expression of CD90/Thy1 that plays a specific role only during periods of increased growth rate.

It is governed by a complex series of events including invasion and intravasation of tumor cells into the stroma and blood, respectively. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotypic change marked by the loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of invasive mesenchymal properties, is implicated in the dissemination of tumor cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), the precursors of metastasis, can be used to interrogate the contribution of EMT in metastasis and therapeutic responses. The analysis of these CTCs and in particular the presence of inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity for markers of EMT has provided new insights into the metastatic process. This review will focus on epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in CTCs and its potential clinical implications.

In Vivo Labeling by CD73 Marks Multipotent Stromal Cells and Highlights Endothelial Heterogeneity in the Bone Marrow Niche	CELL STEM CELL												Despite much work studying ex vivomultipotent stromal cells ( MSCs), the identity and characteristics of MSCs in vivo are not well defined. Here, we generated a CD73-EGFP reporter mouse to address these questions and found EGFP(+) MSCs in various organs. In vivo, EGFP(+) mesenchymal cells were observed in fetal and adult bones at proliferative ossification sites, while in solid organs EGFP(+) cells exhibited a perivascular distribution pattern. EGFP(+) cells from the bone compartment could be clonally expanded ex vivo from single cells and displayed trilineage differentiation potential. Moreover, in the central bone marrow CD73-EGFP(+) specifically labeled sinusoidal endothelial cells, thought to be a critical component of the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Purification and molecular characterization of this CD73-EGFP(+) population revealed an endothelial subtype that also displays a mesenchymal signature, highlighting endothelial cell heterogeneity in the marrow. Thus, the CD73-EGFP mouse is a powerful tool for studying MSCs and sinusoidal endothelium.

Activated fibroblasts are a prevalent component of the stroma, and traditionally, these cells have been considered as a homogenous population derived from pancreatic stellate cells. In this study, we highlight a previously unappreciated heterogeneity of the fibroblast population within the stroma. In particular, a subset of stromal fibroblasts has characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are present in the normal pancreas as well as in the carcinomatous pancreas (CA-MSCs). Here, we determine that CA-MSCs have increased tumor-promoting function compared with MSCs in normal pancreas. This ability to promote tumor growth is associated with CA-MSCs' unique ability to promote alternative macrophage polarization. Thus, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized cell population within the stroma and sheds light on tumor-promoting interactions between different components of the stroma. Significance Targeting the stroma is emerging as a new paradigmin pancreatic cancer; however, efforts to that effect are hampered by our limited understanding of the nature and function of stromal components. Here, we uncover previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the stroma and identify interactions among stromal components that promote tumor growth and could be targeted therapeutically.

The two concepts attempting to explain the origin of intratumor heterogeneity are the cancer stem cell hypothesis and the clonal evolution model. The stochastic model argues that tumors are biologically homogenous and all cancer cells within the tumor have equal ability to propagate the tumor growth depending on continuing mutations and selective pressure. By contrast, the stem cells model suggests that cancer heterogeneity is due to the hierarchy that originates from a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are biologically distinct from the bulk tumor and possesses self-renewal, tumorigenic and multilineage potential. Although these two hypotheses have been discussed for a long time as mutually exclusive explanations of tumor heterogeneity, they are easily reconciled serving as a driving force of cancer evolution and diversity. Recent discovery of the cancer cell plasticity and heterogeneity makes the CSC population a moving target that could be hard to track and eradicate. Understanding the signaling mechanisms regulating CSCs during the course of cancer treatment. can be indispensable for the optimization of current treatment strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Transplanted Dental Pulp Stem/Progenitor Cells (DPSCs) have demonstrated early promise in experimental models of spinal cord injury and stroke, despite limited evidence of neuronal and glial-like differentiation after transplantation. Here, we report, for the first time, on the ability of single cell-derived clonal cultures of murine DPSCs to differentiate in vitro into immature neuronal-like and oligodendrocyte-like cells. Importantly, only DPSC clones with high nestin mRNA expression levels were found to successfully differentiate into Map2 and NF-positive neuronal-like cells. Neuronally differentiated DPSCs possessed a membrane capacitance comparable with primary cultured striatal neurons and small inward voltage-activated K+ but not outward Na+ currents were recorded suggesting a functionally immature phenotype. Similarly, only high nestin-expressing clones demonstrated the ability to adopt Olig1, Olig2, and MBP-positive immature oligodendrocyte-like phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate that appropriate markers may be used to provide an early indication of the suitability of a cell population for purposes where differentiation into a specific lineage may be beneficial and highlight that further understanding of heterogeneity within mixed cellular populations is required.

Atypical Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Responses to Topographic Modifications of Titanium Biomaterials Indicate Cytoskeletal- and Genetic Plasticity-Based Heterogeneity of Cells	STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												Titanium (Ti) is widely used as a biomaterial for endosseous implants due to its relatively inert surface oxide layer that enables implanted devices the ability of assembling tissue reparative components that culminate in osseointegration. Topographic modifications in the form of micro- and nanoscaled structures significantly promote osseointegration and enhance the osteogenic differentiation of adult mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). While the biological mechanisms central to the differential responses of tissues and cells to Ti surface modifications remain unknown, adhesion and morphological adaptation are amongst the earliest events at the cell-biomaterial interface that are highly influenced by surface topography and profoundly impact the regulation of stem cell fate determination. This study correlated the effects of Ti topographic modifications on adhesion and morphological adaptation of human MSCs with phenotypic change. The results showed that modified Ti topographies precluded the adhesion of a subset of MSCs while incurring distinct morphological constraints on adherent cells. These effects anomalously corresponded with a differential expression of stem cell pluripotency and Wnt signalling-associated markers on both modified surfaces while additionally differing between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface modifications-though extent of osteogenic differentiation induced by both modified topographies yielded similarly significant higher levels of cellular mineralisation in contrast to polished Ti. These results suggest that in the absence of deposited proteins and soluble factors, both modified topographies incur the selective adhesion of a subpopulation of progenitors with relatively higher cytoskeletal plasticity. While the presence of deposited proteins and soluble factors does not significantly affect adherence of cells, nanotopographic modifications enhance expression of pluripotency markers in proliferative conditions, which are conversely overridden by both modified topographies in osteogenic inductive conditions. Further deciphering the mechanisms underlying cellular selectivity and Ti topographic responsiveness will improve our understanding of stem cell heterogeneity and advance the potential of MSCs in regenerative medicine.

Materials and Methods: Blood was obtained from 38 pre-treated patients with mBC before a new line of treatment. CTC detection and characterization was performed by triple immunofluorescent staining, while Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) were analyzed by multi-flow cytometry. Results: CTCs were detected in 16 (42.1%) of patients. Based on the co-expression of ALDH1, TWIST and CK, CTCs revealed an important heterogeneity: CTCs with a CSC/partial-EMT, CSC/Epithelial-like, non-CSC/partial-EMT and non-CSC/Epithelial-like phenotype were detected in 7 (18.4%), 7 (18.4%), 1 (1.4%) and 9 (23.7%) of patients, respectively. Immunophenotyping of MDSCs identified 2 monocytic IM-MDSCs; CD14(+) CD15(+)CD11b(+)CD33(+) HLA-DR- Lin(-) (CD14(+)CD15(+)) and CD14(+)CD15(-)CD11b(+) CD33(+) HLA-DR- Lin(-) (CD14(+) CD15(-))] and one granulocytic (G-MDSCs; CD14 CD15(+)CD11b(+) CD33(+) HLA-DR- Lin- (CD14 CD15(+))] subpopulations, expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. Patients with detectable CTCs had a higher frequency of Tregs (CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(high); p=0.022) whereas a positive correlation was found between CTC counts and the percentage of Tregs (p=0.005) and CD14(+) CD15(+) M-MDSCs (p=0.024). Patients with a partial-EMT phenotype had a higher frequency of CD14(+)CD15(+) M-MDSCs (p=0.023). Patients harboring the non-CSC/epithelial-like CTC subpopulation had an increased frequency of CD14-CD15(+) G-MDSCs (p=0.020), along with decreased levels of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(high) FoxP3+ Tregs (p=0.020). Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that CTCs in ER-/HER2(-) mBC patients may be under the control of the immune system and various immune escape mechanisms might be involved during the different stages of their biological evolution.																	0250-7005	1791-7530				FEB	2021	41	2					661	670		10.21873/anticanres.14817							WOS:000629377300011	33517270

Recent studies have revealed involvement of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in regulating CSCs. However, the intracellular molecular mechanisms that determine the regulatory role of CAFs in modulating the plasticity of CSCs remain unknown. Here, we uncovered that intracellular Notch1 signaling in CAFs serves as a molecular switch, which modulates tumor heterogeneity and aggressiveness by inversely controlling stromal regulation of the plasticity and stemness of CSCs. Using mesenchymal stem cell-derived fibroblasts (MSC-DF) harboring reciprocal loss-of-function and gain-of-function Notch1 signaling, we found that MSC-DFNotch1-/- prompted cocultured melanoma cells to form more spheroids and acquire the phenotype (CD271(+) and Nestin(+)) of melanoma stem/initiating cells (MICs), whereas MSC-DFN1IC+/+ suppressed melanoma cell sphere formation and mitigated properties of MICs. MSC-DFNotch1-/- increased stemness of CD271(+) MIC, which resultantly exhibited stronger aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo, by upregulating Sox2/Oct4/Nanog expression. Consistently, when cografted with melanoma cells into NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice, MSC-DFNotch1-/- increased, but MSC-DFN1IC+/+ decreased, the amounts of CD271(+) MIC in melanoma tissue. The amounts of CD271(+) MIC regulated by MSC-DF carrying high or low Notch1 pathway activity is well correlated with capability of melanoma metastasis, supporting that melanoma metastasis is MIC-mediated. Our data demonstrate that intracellular Notch1 signaling in CAFs is a molecular switch dictating the plasticity and stemness of MICs, thereby regulating melanoma aggressiveness, and therefore that targeting the intracellular Notch1 signaling pathway in CAFs may present a new therapeutic strategy for melanoma.

However, the heterogeneity of MSCs impedes their use for regenerative medicine. Further investigation of this phenotype is required to develop cell therapies with improved clinical efficacy. Here, a small-sized population of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCB-MSCs) was isolated using a filter and centrifuge system to analyze its stem cell characteristics. Consequently, this population showed higher cell growth and lower senescence. Additionally, it exhibited diverse stem cell properties including differentiation, stemness, and adhesion, as compared to those of the population before isolation. Using cell surface protein array or sorting analysis, both EGFR and CD49f were identified as markers associated with the small-sized population. Accordingly, suppression of these surface proteins abolished the superior characteristics of this population. Moreover, compared to that with large or nonisolated populations, the small-sized population showed greater therapeutic efficacy by promoting the engraftment potential of infused cells and reducing lung damage in an emphysema mouse model. Therefore, the isolation of this small-sized population of UCB-MSCs could be a simple and effective way to enhance the efficacy of cell therapy.

To develop novel therapeutic strategies that target CSCs, we established osteosarcoma-initiating (OSi) cells by introducing the c-Myc gene into bone marrow stromal cells derived fromInk4a/ArfKO mice. These OSi cells include bipotent committed cells (similar to osteochondral progenitor cells) with a high tumorigenic activity as well as tripotent cells (similar to mesenchymal stem cells) of low tumorigenicity. We recently showed that the tripotent OSi cells are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, and that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in these cells induces their terminal adipocyte differentiation and suppresses their tumorigenicity. We here provide an overview of modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics associated with terminal adipocyte differentiation in osteosarcoma as well as discuss the prospects for new therapeutic strategies that target chemoresistant CSCs by inducing their differentiation.

Notwithstanding their autologous origin and their potential to differentiate towards cells of all three germ layers, iPSC reprogramming is still affected by low efficiency. As dermal fibroblast is the most used human cell for reprogramming, we hypothesize that the variability in reprogramming is, at least partially, because of the skin fibroblasts used. Human dermal fibroblasts harvested from five different anatomical sites (neck, breast, arm, abdomen and thigh) were cultured and their morphology, proliferation, apoptotic rate, ability to migrate, expression of mesenchymal or epithelial markers, differentiation potential and production of growth factors were evaluated in vitro. Additionally, gene expression analysis was performed by real-time PCR including genes typically expressed by mesenchymal cells. Finally, fibroblasts isolated from different anatomic sites were reprogrammed to iPSCs by integration-free method. Intriguingly, while the morphology of fibroblasts derived from different anatomic sites differed only slightly, other features, known to affect cell reprogramming, varied greatly and in accordance with anatomic site of origin. Accordingly, difference also emerged in fibroblasts readiness to respond to reprogramming and ability to form colonies. Therefore, as fibroblasts derived from different anatomic sites preserve positional memory, it is of great importance to accurately evaluate and select dermal fibroblast population prior to induce reprogramming.

ELF3 mediates IL-1 alpha induced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to inflammatory iCAFs	STEM CELLS												Stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment regulate the immune landscape and tumor progression. Yet, the ontogeny and heterogeneity of reactive stromal cells within tumors is not well understood. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts exhibiting an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) have been identified within multiple cancers; however, mechanisms that lead to their recruitment and differentiation also remain undefined. Targeting these mechanisms therapeutically may be important in managing cancer progression. Here, we identify the ELF3 transcription factor as the canonical mediator of IL-1 alpha-induced differentiation of prostate mesenchymal stem cells to an iCAF phenotype, typical of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, IL-1 alpha-induced iCAFs were subsequently refractive to TGF-beta 1 induced trans-differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype (myCAF), another key carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtype typical of reactive stroma in cancer. Restricted trans-differentiation was associated with phosphorylation of the YAP protein, indicating that interplay between ELF3 action and activation of the Hippo pathway are critical for restricting trans-differentiation of iCAFs. Together, these data show that the IL-1 alpha/ELF3/YAP pathways are coordinate for regulating inflammatory carcinoma-associated fibroblast differentiation.

Here, we demonstrate that MSC derived from murine pericardial adipose tissue (pMSC) constitute two cohorts of population distinguished by the level of CD73 expression (termed as CD73(high) and CD73(low) pMSC). Transplantation of two types of cells into mouse hearts after myocardial infarction (MI) revealed that the CD73(high) pMSC preferentially brought about structural and functional repair in comparison to the PBS control and CD73(low) pMSC. Furthermore, the CD73(high) pMSC displayed a pronounced anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating CCR2(+) macrophage infiltration and upregulating several anti-inflammatory genes 5 days after in vivo transplantation and ex vivo cocultivation with peritoneal macrophages. The immunomodulatory effect was not seen in cocultivation experiments with pMSC derived from CD73 knockout mice (CD73(-/-)) but was partially blocked by pretreatment of the A2b receptor antagonist, PSB603. The results highlight a heterogeneity of the CD73 expression that may be related to its catalytic products on the modulation of the local immune response and thus provide a possible explanation to the inconsistency of the regenerative results when different sources of donor cells were used in stem cell-based therapy.

The only available treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation that has still high morbidity and mortality. The goal of the present study was to generate iPSCs from bone marrow-derived MSCs of osteopetrosis patients with three most common mutations by using two different integration-free gene transfer methods and compare their efficiencies. The secondary objective was to select the most appropriate integration-free production method for our institutional iPSC bank using this rare disease as a prototype. Methods: Two different integration-free gene transfer methods (episomal and Sendai viral vectors) were tested and compared on the same set of patient samples exhibiting three different mutations associated with osteopetrosis. Generated iPSCs were characterized by standard assays, including immunophenotyping, immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, embryoid body, and teratoma assays. Karyotype analyses were performed to evaluate genetic stability. Results: iPSC lines exhibiting typical ESC-like colony morphology were shown to express pluripotency markers by immunofluorescence staining. Over 90% of the cells were found positive for SSEA-4 and OCT3/4 and negative/weak positive for CD29 by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical staining of teratoma and spontaneously differentiated embryoid body sections confirmed their trilineage differentiation potential. All iPSC lines expressed pluripotency-related genes. Karyotype analyses were found normal. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA showed that disease-related mutations were retained in the patient-specific iPSCs. Conclusion: Generation of iPSC using SeV and episomal DNA vectors have several advantages over other methods like the ease of production, reliability, high efficiency, and safety, which is required for translational research. Furthermore, owing to the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity, patient-specific iPSCs seem to be ideal cell source for the modeling of a rare genetic bone disease like osteopetrosis to identify osteoclast defects, leading to clinical heterogeneity in osteopetrosis patients, especially among those with different mutations in the same gene.

Interrogation of Phenotypic Plasticity between Epithelial and Mesenchymal States in Breast Cancer	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE												Dynamic interconversions between transitional epithelial and mesenchymal states underpin the epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) seen in some carcinoma cell systems. We have delineated epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations existing within the PMC42-LA breast cancer cell line by their EpCAM expression. These purified but phenotypically plastic states, EpCAM(High) (epithelial) and EpCAM(Low) (mesenchymal), have the ability to regain the phenotypic equilibrium of the parental population (i.e., 80% epithelial and 20% mesenchymal) over time, although the rate of reversion in the mesenchymal direction (epithelial-mesenchymal transition; EMT) is higher than that in the epithelial direction (mesenchymal-epithelial transition; MET). Single-cell clonal propagation was implemented to delineate the molecular and cellular features of this intrinsic heterogeneity with respect to EMP flux. The dynamics of the phenotypic proportions of epithelial and mesenchymal states in single-cell generated clones revealed clonal diversity and intrinsic plasticity. Single cell-derived clonal progenies displayed differences in their functional attributes of proliferation, stemness marker (CD44/CD24), migration, invasion and chemo-sensitivity. Interrogation of genomic copy number variations (CNV) with whole exome sequencing (WES) in the context of chromosome count from metaphase spread indicated that chromosomal instability was not influential in driving intrinsic phenotypic plasticity. Overall, these findings reveal the stochastic nature of both the epithelial and mesenchymal subpopulations, and the single cell-derived clones for differential functional attributes.				; Thompson, Erik Walter/A-1425-2009	monkman, james/0000-0002-7219-8402; Thompson, Erik Walter/0000-0002-9723-4924; Bhatia, Sugandha/0000-0003-3092-8283													2077-0383				JUN	2019	8	6							893	10.3390/jcm8060893							WOS:000475349300137	31234417

Here we show that the transcription factor PATZ1 gene is upregulated in gliomas compared to normal brain and, among GBMs, is particularly enriched in the proneural subtype and co-localize with stemness markers. Accordingly, in GBM-derived glioma-initiating stem cells (GSCs) PATZ1 is overexpressed compared to differentiated tumor cells and its expression significantly correlates with the characteristic stem cell capacity to grow as neurospheres in vitro. Interestingly, survival analysis demonstrated that PATZ1 lower levels informed poor prognosis in GBM and, specifically, in the proneural subgroup, suggesting it may serve a role as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for intra-subtype heterogeneity of proneural GBM. We also show that PATZ1 suppresses the expression of the mesenchyme-inducer CXCR4, and that PATZ1 and CXCR4 are inversely correlated in GSC and proneural GBM. Overall these findings support a central role of PATZ1 in regulating malignancy of GBM.

However, knowledge is limited regarding the expression and characteristics of marker-positive gastric CSCs. Therefore, gastric CSCs from a series of human gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-5, SNU-16, BGC-823, PAMC-82, MKN-45, and NCI-N87) using four putative CSC surface markers (CD44, CD90, CD133, and epithelial-cell adhesion molecule) were investigated the underlying mechanisms regulating such subpopulations. Only SNU-5 and SNU-16 exhibited independent co-expression of CD44(+) and CD90(+), which exhibited spheroid-colony formation in vitro and tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. Functional studies revealed that CD44(+) cells were more invasive compared with CD90(+) cells, whereas CD90(+) cells exhibited higher levels of proliferation than CD44(+) cells. Furthermore, serial xenotransplantation in mice of CD44(+)/CD90(+) cells derived from SNU-5 and SNU-16 revealed rapid growth of CD90(+) cells in subcutaneous lesions and a high metastatic capacity of CD44(+) cells in the lung. Mechanistic analyses revealed that CD44(+) cells underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) following acquisition of mesenchymal features, whereas CD90(+) cells enhanced the activation of retinoblastoma phosphorylation at Ser780 and oncogenic cell cycle regulators. The expression of CD44 and CD90 in gastric cancer tissues was associated with distant metastasis and the differentiation state of tumors. These results demonstrated that CD44 and CD90 are specific biomarkers capable of identifying and isolating metastatic and tumorigenic CSCs through their ability to regulate EMT and the cell cycle in gastric cancer cell lines.																	0300-8177	1573-4919				SEP	2019	459	1-2					35	47		10.1007/s11010-019-03548-1							WOS:000478762700004	31073886

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) raise high hopes in clinical applications. However, the lack of common standards and a precise definition of MSC preparations remains a major obstacle in research and application of MSC. Whereas surface antigen markers have failed to precisely define this population, a combination of proteomic data and microarray data provides a new dimension for the definition of MSC preparations. Methods. In our continuing effort to characterize MSC, we have analyzed the differential transcriptome and proteome expression profiles of MSC preparations isolated from human bone marrow under two different expansion media (BM-MSC-M1 and BM-MSC-M2). Results. In proteomics, 136 protein spots were unambiguously identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and corresponding cDNA spots were selected on our "Human Transcriptome cDNA Microarray." Combination of datasets; revealed a correlation in differential gene expression and protein expression of BM-MSC-M1 vs BM-MSC-M2. Genes involved in metabolism were more highly expressed in BM-MSC-M1, whereas genes involved in development, morphogenesis, extracellular matrix, and differentiation were more highly expressed in BM-MSC-M2. Interchanging culture conditions for 8 days revealed that differential expression was retained in several genes whereas it was altered in others. Conclusion. Our results have provided evidence that homogeneous BM-MSC preparations can reproducibly be isolated under standardized conditions, whereas culture conditions exert a prominent impact on transcriptome, proteome, and cellular organization of BM-MSC.

Although the potential therapeutic use of MSCs is considerable, studies and clinical treatment efficacy are preliminary due to the heterogeneity of MSCs. Herein, based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single cell sequence properties, we demonstrated that B7-H1 plays an important role in the immunosuppressive function of human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) in a collagen-induced arthritis murine model that is dependent on STAT3 signaling. Our data offer convincing evidence that B7-H1 expression by GMSCs helps to identify a new subpopulation of MSCs with a greater immunosuppressive property. The approach provides a unique and additional strategy for stem cells-based therapies of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.																	1525-0016	1525-0024				NOV 4	2020	28	11					2417	2429		10.1016/j.ymthe.2020.07.002							WOS:000588103600012	32707035

Cells in complex organisms can transition between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes during both normal and malignant physiological events. These two phenotypes are not binary, but rather describe a spectrum of cell states along an axis. Mammalian cells can undergo dynamic and heterogenous bidirectional interconversions along the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic (EMP) spectrum, and such transitions are marked by morphological change. Here, we exploit digital holographic cytometry (DHC) to develop a tractable method for monitoring the degree, kinetics, and heterogeneity of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes in adherent mammalian cell populations. First, we demonstrate that the epithelial and mesenchymal states of the same cell line present distinct DHC-derived morphological features. Second, we identify quantitative changes in these features that occur hours after induction of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We apply this approach to achieve label-free tracking of the degree and the rate of EMP transitions. We conclude that DHC is an efficient method to investigate morphological changes during transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from patients with SLE maintain an interferon signature during in vitro culture	CYTOKINE												Background: We have previously shown that SLE BMSC have decreased proliferation, increased ROS, increased DNA damage and repair (DDR), a senescence associated secretory phenotype, and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. We have also shown SLE BMSC produce increased amounts of interferon beta (IFN ss), have increased mRNA for several genes induced by IFN beta, and have a pro-inflammatory feedback loop mediated by a MAVS. To better understand the phenotype of SLE BMSC we conducted mRNA sequencing. Methods: Patients fulfilling SLE classification criteria and age and sex matched healthy controls were recruited under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples were obtained. BMSC were isolated and grown in tissue culture. Early passage BMSC were harvested and mRNA samples were sent for RNAseq. Serum samples were assayed for IFN beta by ELISA. Results: On the basis of top differentially expressed genes between SLE and healthy controls, SLE patients with high levels of serum IFN beta clustered together while SLE patients with low levels of IFN ss clustered with healthy controls. Those genes differentially expressed in SLE patients generally belonged to known IFN pathways, and showed a strong overlap with the set of genes differentially expressed in IFN beta high subjects, per se. Moreover, gene expression changes induced by treating healthy BMSC with exogenous IFN beta were remarkably similar to gene expression differences in SLE IFN beta high vs low BMSC. Conclusions: BMSCs from SLE patients are heterogeneous. A subgroup of SLE BMSC is distinguished from other SLE BMSC and from controls by increased levels of mRNAs induced by type I interferons. This subgroup of SLE patients had increased levels of IFN beta in vivo.

Here, seven hepatobiliary tumor organoids are generated to explore heterogeneity and evolution via single-cell RNA sequencing. HCC272 with high status of epithelia-mesenchymal transition proves broad-spectrum drug resistance. By examining the expression pattern of cancer stem cells markers (e.g., PROM1, CD44, and EPCAM), it is found that CD44 positive population may render drug resistance in HCC272. UMAP and pseudo-time analysis identify the intratumoral heterogeneity and distinct evolutionary trajectories, of which catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) advantage expression clusters are commonly shared across hepatobiliary organoids. CellphoneDB analysis further implies that metabolism advantage organoids with enrichment of hypoxia signal upregulate NEAT1 expression in CD44 subgroup and mediate drug resistance that relies on Jak-STAT pathway. Moreover, metabolism advantage clusters shared in several organoids have similar characteristic genes (GAPDH, NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream regulated 1), ALDOA, and CA9). The combination of GAPDH and NDRG1 is an independent risk factor and predictor for patient survival. This study delineates heterogeneity of hepatobiliary tumor organoids and proposes that the collaboration of intratumoral heterogenic subpopulations renders malignant phenotypes and drug resistance.

These cancer cells, defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) spreading through the blood stream, may develop metastatic lesions or remain dormant. Some emerging clinical evidence supports that some tumor cells may possess metastatic properties already in the earlier stages of tumorigenesis. Because the initiation and progression of vertical growth in human melanoma is fundamental to the notion of tumor virulence and progression, we decided to immune-magnetic collect and molecularly characterize circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) from melanoma patients AJCC staged = pT1b (i.e., transition from radial to vertical phase). CMCs are phenotypically and molecularly heterogeneous, thus we performed a "home-made Liquid-Biopsy," by targeting the melanoma-associated-antigen, MCAM/MUC18/CD146, and/or the melanoma-initiating marker, ABCB5. We assessed a biomarker qualitative expression panel, contemplating the angiogenic-potential, melanoma-initiating and melanoma-differentiation drivers, cell-cell adhesion molecules, matrix-metallo-proteinases, which was performed on three enriched subpopulations from a total of 61 blood-samples from 21 melanoma patients. At first, a significant differential expression of the specific transcripts was documented between and within the CMC fractions enriched with MCAM-, ABCB5-, and both MCAM/ABCB5-coated beads, when analyzing two distinct groups: early AJCC- (stage I-II) and advanced- staged patients (stage II-IV). Moreover, in the early-AJCC staged-group, we could distinguish "endothelial," CD45(-)MCAM(+)enriched-, "stem" S-CMCs, CD45(-)ABCB5(+)enriched- and a third hybrid bi-phenotypic CD45(-)MCAM(+)/ABCB5(+)enriched-fractions, due to three distinct gene-expression profiles. In particular, the endothelial-CMCs were characterized by positive expression of genes involved in migration and invasion, whilst the stem CMC-fraction only expressed stem and differentiation markers. The third subpopulation isolated based on concurrent MCAM and ABCB5 protein expression showed an invasive phenotype. All three distinct CMCs sub-populations, exhibited a primitive, "stem-mesenchymal" profile suggesting a highly aggressive and metastasizing phenotype. This study confirms the phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity observed in melanoma and highlights those putative genes involved in early melanoma spreading and disease progression.

A deeper understanding of the heterogeneity and intercellular communication within these heterogeneous subpopulations has significant implications for the potential of MSC-based therapy from the bench to the clinic. Here, we focused on the clonal osteogenic heterogeneity of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and explored how interclonal communication affects the osteogenic differentiation among these heterogeneous single-cell colonies (SCCs), and sought to determine the underlying mechanisms. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red staining identified the presence of SCCs with high (H-SCCs) and low osteogenic ability (L-SCCs). Conditioned medium derived from H-SCCs (H-CM) promoted mineralized nodule formation to a greater extent than that derived from L-SCCs (L-CM), which served as the target cells (TCs). However, treatment with the exosome biogenesis/release inhibitor GW4869 reduced the H-CM- and L-CM-related osteogenic differentiation-promoting potential. We further found that exosomes secreted by H-SCCs (H-Exo) were superior to those secreted by L-SCCs (L-Exo) in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of TCs. Mechanistically, TCs stimulated with H-CM and H-Exo exhibited higher levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, while gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy was positively associated with SCC osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, PINK1 knock-down in H-Exo- and L-Exo-stimulated TCs inhibited their osteogenic differentiation through inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism that an exosome-mediated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy regulates interclonal communication among SCCs with osteogenic heterogeneity.</p>																	2296-634X					SEP 17	2021	9								687258	10.3389/fcell.2021.687258							WOS:000717286700001	34604210

The major obstacle lies in the lack of generic biomarkers for different cancer types and the requirement of complicated immuno-labeling procedures. The purpose of this study is to establish a label-free platform for CSLC isolation using pH-responsive chitosan. Based on the adhesive heterogeneity, 15.7 +/- 1.9 % of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 detached from the chitosan substrate following medium pH elevation from 6.99 to 7.65 within 1 h. As a result, this subpopulation of cells with low adhesiveness exhibited superior CSLC hallmarks, including self-renewal, invasive and metastatic potential, therapeutic-resistance, colony formation in vitro, as well as nude mice xenograft in vivo for tumorigenesis, in comparison with their high-adhesive counterpart. Furthermore, integrin beta 4 is decisive in controlling CSLC detachment of NSCLC. Conclusively, this pH-dependent isolation provides new insights into biomaterial-based CSLC isolation.				; Cheng, Naichen/H-7596-2013	Yen, Chia-Hsiang/0000-0003-1554-7482; Ji, You-Ren/0000-0001-6394-041X; Cheng, Naichen/0000-0003-4071-5628												0144-8617	1879-1344				JUL 1	2020	239								116168	10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116168							WOS:000533507300019	32414450

Morphological landscapes from high content imaging reveal cytokine priming strategies that enhance mesenchymal stromal cell immunosuppression	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING												Successful clinical translation of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) products has not been achieved in the United States and may be in large part due to MSC functional heterogeneity. Efforts have been made to identify "priming" conditions that produce MSCs with consistent immunomodulatory function; however, challenges remain with predicting and understanding how priming impacts MSC behavior. The purpose of this study was to develop a high throughput, image-based approach to assess MSC morphology in response to combinatorial priming treatments and establish morphological profiling as an effective approach to screen the effect of manufacturing changes (i.e., priming) on MSC immunomodulation. We characterized the morphological response of multiple MSC lines/passages to an array of Interferongamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) priming conditions, as well as the effects of priming on MSC modulation of activated T cells and MSC secretome. Although considerable functional heterogeneity, in terms of T-cell suppression, was observed between different MSC lines and at different passages, this heterogeneity was significantly reduced with combined IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha priming. The magnitude of this change correlated strongly with multiple morphological features and was also reflected by MSC secretion of immunomodulatory factors, for example, PGE2, ICAM-1, and CXCL16. Overall, this study further demonstrates the ability of priming to enhance MSC function, as well as the ability of morphology to better understand MSC heterogeneity and predict changes in function due to manufacturing.

Profiling intratumor heterogeneity can reveal the molecular mechanism of bladder cancer recurrence. Experimental Design: Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on tumors from 13 patients with low recurrence risk, high recurrence risk, and recurrent bladder cancer. Results: Our study generated a comprehensive cancer-cell atlas consisting of 54,971 single cells and identified distinct cell subpopulations. We found that the cancer stem-cell subpopulation is enriched during bladder cancer recurrence with elevated expression of EZH2. We further defined a subpopulation-specific molecular mechanism whereby EZH2 maintains H3K27me3-mediated repression of the NCAM1 gene, thereby inactivating the cell invasive and stemness transcriptional program. Furthermore, taking advantage of this large single-cell dataset, we elucidated the spectrum of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in clinical samples and revealed distinct EMT features associated with bladder cancer subtypes. We identified that TCF7 promotes EMT in corroboration with single-cell ATAC with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis. Additionally, we constructed regulatory networks specific to recurrent bladder cancer. Conclusions: Our study and analytic approaches herein provide a rich resource for the further study of cancer stem cells and EMT in the bladder cancer research field.																	1078-0432	1557-3265				NOV	2021	27	22					6265	6278		10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4796							WOS:000719879400020	34526362

These MSCs are often administered to patients immediately after thawing the cryopreserved product (out-of-thaw), yet little is known about the single-cell transcriptomic landscape and tissue-specific differences of out-of-thaw human MSCs. Methods 13 hMSC samples derived from 10 "healthy" donors were used to assess donor variability and tissue-of-origin differences in single-cell gene expression profiles. hMSCs derived and expanded from the bone marrow (BM) or cord tissue (CT) underwent controlled-rate freezing for 24 h. Cells were then transferred to the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for cryopreservation. hMSCs cryopreserved for at least one week, were characterized immediately after thawing using a droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing method. Data analysis was performed with SC3 and SEURAT pipelines followed by gene ontology analysis. Results scRNA-seq analysis of the hMSCs revealed two major clusters of donor profiles, which differ in immune-signaling, cell surface properties, abundance of cell-cycle related transcripts, and metabolic pathways of interest. Within-sample transcriptomic heterogeneity is low. We identified numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are associated with various cellular functions, such as cytokine signaling, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis, and regulation of apoptosis. Gene-set enrichment analyses indicated different functional pathways in BM vs. CT hMSCs. In addition, MSC-batches showed significant variations in cell cycle status, suggesting different proliferative vs. immunomodulatory potential. Several potential transcript-markers for tissue source differences were identified for further investigation in future studies. In functional assays, both BM and CT MSCs suppressed macrophage TNF alpha secretion upon interferon stimulation. However, differences between donors, tissue-of-origin, and cell cycle are evident in both TNF suppression and cytokine secretion. Conclusions This study shows that donor differences in hMSC transcriptome are minor relative to the intrinsic differences in tissue-of-origin. hMSCs with different transcriptomic profiles showed potential differences in functional characteristics. These findings contribute to our understanding of tissue origin-based differences in out-of-thaw therapeutic hMSC products and assist in the identification of cells with immune-regulatory or survival potential from a heterogeneous MSC population. Our results form the basis of future studies in correlating single-cell transcriptomic markers with immunomodulatory functions.																		1757-6512				NOV 4	2021	12	1							565	10.1186/s13287-021-02627-9							WOS:000714603000002	34736534

Human multipotent stromal cells undergo sharp transition from division to development in culture	STEM CELLS												Human mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), are of interest for clinical therapy, in part because of their capacity for proliferation and differentiation. However, results from clinical trials and in vitro models have been variable, possibly because of MSC heterogeneity and a lack of standardization between MSC in vitro expansion protocols. Here we defined changes in MSCs during expansion in vitro. In low-density cultures, MSCs expand through distinct lag, exponential growth, and stationary phases. We assayed cultures of passage 2 human MSCs from three donors at low density ( 50 cells per cm(2)) at approximately 5% confluence on day 2 and after the cultures had expanded to approximately 70% confluence on day 7. On day 2, genes involved in cell division were upregulated. On day 7, genes for cell development were upregulated. The variations among three donors were less than the variation within the expansion of MSCs from a single donor. The microarray data for selected genes were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and FACScan analysis. Approximately 50% of cells at day 2 were in S-phase compared with 10% at day 7. The results demonstrated major differences in early and late stage cultures of MSCs that should be considered in using the cells in experiments and clinical applications.

K. Alfred			APOBEC3G acts as a therapeutic target in mesenchymal gliomas by sensitizing cells to radiation-induced cell death	ONCOTARGET												Genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses of brain tumors reveal that subtypes differ in their pathway activity, progression, and response to therapy. We performed an expression profiling of Glioma Initiating Cells (GICs) and comparative analysis between different groups of GICs indicates major variations in gene expression. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed groups of GICs reflecting their heterogeneity, and among some of the genes as major regulators of mesenchymal phenotype, we identified ABOBEC3G as one of the most discriminating genes in mesenchymal group. ABOBEC3G revealed a strong correlation with overall survival in TCGA GBM patient cohorts. APOBEC3G regulates cell invasion and silencing of this gene in GICs inhibits cell invasion and also glioma sphere initiation. APOBEC3G controls invasion through TGF beta/Smad2 pathway by regulating Smad2 target genes Thrombospondin 1, matrix metallopeptidase 2 and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1. We also show that targeting APOBEC3G can sensitize cancer cells to radiation induced cell death by attenuating activation of the DNA repair pathway. This response is mainly shown by decreased pChk2 expression in knockdown APOBEC3G cells. Taken together, we show that APOBEC3G gene is a mesenchymal enriched gene that controls invasion and knockdown of APOBEC3G sensitizes cells to radiation induced cell death, suggesting that APOBEC3G can be considered for use in stratifying patients with GBM for prognostic considerations.

Mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from adipose tissue (AD-MSCs) represent a viable source for the development of cell-based therapies. However, the heterogeneity and variable differentiation ability of AD-MSCs depend on the cellular composition and represent a strong limitation for their use in therapeutic applications. In order to fully understand the cellular composition of MSC preparations, it would be essential to analyze AD-MSCs at single-cell level.MethodRecent advances in single-cell technologies have opened the way for high-dimensional, high-throughput, and high-resolution measurements of biological systems. We made use of the cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) technology to explore the cellular composition of 17 human AD-MSCs, interrogating 31 markers at single-cell level. Subcellular composition of the AD-MSCs was investigated in their naive state as well as during osteogenic commitment, via unsupervised dimensionality reduction as well as supervised representation learning approaches.ResultThis study showed a high heterogeneity and variability in the subcellular composition of AD-MSCs upon isolation and prolonged culture. Algorithm-guided identification of emerging subpopulations during osteogenic differentiation of AD-MSCs allowed the identification of an ALP+/CD73+ subpopulation of cells with enhanced osteogenic differentiation potential. We could demonstrate in vitro that the sorted ALP+/CD73+ subpopulation exhibited enhanced osteogenic potential and is moreover fundamental for osteogenic lineage commitment. We finally showed that this subpopulation was present in freshly isolated human adipose-derived stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) and that could ultimately be used for cell therapies.ConclusionThe data obtained reveal, at single-cell level, the heterogeneity of AD-MSCs from several donors and highlight how cellular composition impacts the osteogenic differentiation capacity. The marker combination (ALP/CD73) can not only be used to assess the differentiation potential of undifferentiated AD-MSC preparations, but also could be employed to prospectively enrich AD-MSCs from the stromal vascular fraction of human adipose tissue for therapeutic applications.

Despite the multiple roles of adipose tissue in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis, adipocytes are thought to be largely homogenous with only 2 major subtypes recognized in humans so far. Here we report the existence and characteristics of 4 distinct human adipocyte subtypes, and of their respective mesenchymal progenitors. The phenotypes of these distinct adipocyte subtypes are differentially associated with key adipose tissue functions, including thermogenesis, lipid storage, and adipokine secretion. The transcriptomic signature of "brite/beige" thermogenic adipocytes reveals mechanisms for iron accumulation and protection from oxidative stress, necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration upon activation. Importantly, this signature is enriched in human supraclavicular adipose tissue, confirming that these cells comprise thermogenic depots in vivo, and explain previous findings of a rate-limiting role of iron in adipose tissue browning. The mesenchymal progenitors that give rise to beige/brite adipocytes express a unique set of cytokines and transcriptional regulators involved in immune cell modulation of adipose tissue browning. Unexpectedly, we also find adipocyte subtypes specialized for high-level expression of the adipokines adiponectin or leptin, associated with distinct transcription factors previously implicated in adipocyte differentiation. The finding of a broad adipocyte repertoire derived from a distinct set of mesenchymal progenitors, and of the transcriptional regulators that can control their development, provides a framework for understanding human adipose tissue function and role in metabolic disease.

Recently, Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been shown to modulate MSC functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of several TLR ligands on the interaction between MSC and natural killer (NK) cells. Our results show that TLR-primed adult bone marrow and embryonic MSC are more resistant than unprimed MSC to IL-2-activated NK-induced killing. Such protection can be explained by the modulation of Natural Killer group 2D ligands major histocompatibility complex class I chain A and ULBP3 and DNAM-1 ligands by TLR-primed MSC. These results indicate that MSCs are able to adapt their immuno-behavior in an inflammatory context, decreasing their susceptibility to NK killing. In addition, TLR3 but not TLR4-primed MSC enhance their suppressive functions against NK cells. However, the efficiency of this response is heterogeneous, even if the phenotypes of different analyzed MSC are rather homogeneous. The consequences could be important in MSC-mediated cell therapy, since the heterogeneity of adult MSC responders may be explored in order to select the more efficient responders.

In this study, using a four-color cytofluorimetric protocol, we demonstrated that cultured MSC derived from the bone marrow of patients with hematologic malignancies showed alterations in the expression of CD105, CD90, CD184, and HLA-DR molecules. The decrease in the percentage of CD105(+) and CD90(+) MSC correlated with an increased bone marrow angiogenesis. This paper provides evidence that multiparametric flow cytometry is essential for the establishment of a standardized protocol to identify various MSCs subsets and aberrant phenotypes.

Cell-cell interactions within the niche are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the niche cells supporting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transitamplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in niche cells. This Runx2-mediated IGF signaling is crucial for regulating the MSC niche and maintaining tissue homeostasis to support continuous growth of the adult mouse incisor, providing a model for analysis of the molecular regulation of the MSC niche.

Study design: MSCs obtained from 30 samples of CV, 30 of AF and 10 placentas (obtained from elective caesarean sections) were compared. MSCs at second confluence cultures were characterized by immunophenotypic analysis with flow cytometry using FACS CANTO II. The expression of the genes Oct-4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4, also known as POU5F1), Sox-2 (SRY box-containing factor 2), Nanog, Rex-1 (Zfp-42) and Pax-6 (Paired Box Protein-6), was analyzed. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by ABI Prism 7700, after RNA isolation and retro-transcription in cDNA. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis (XLSTAT 2011) and confirmed by REST software, to estimate fold changes between samples. Each gene was defined differentially expressed if p-value was <0.05. Results: Cells from all samples were negative for haematopoietic antigens CD45, CD34, CD117 and CD33 and positive for the typical MSCs antigens CD13, CD73 and CD90. Nevertheless, MSCs from AF and placentas showed different fluorescence intensity, reflecting the heterogeneity of these tissues. The gene expression of OCT-4, SOX-2, NANOG was not significantly different among the three groups. In AF, REX-1 and PAX-6 showed a higher expression in comparison to CV. Conclusions: MSCs of different extra-embryonic tissues showed no differences in immunophenotype when collected from second confluence cultures. The expression of OCF-4, NANOG and SOX-2 was not significantly different, demonstrating that all fetal sources are suitable for obtaining MSCs. These results open new possibilities for the clinical use of MSCs derived from easily accessible sources, in order to develop new protocols for clinical and experimental research.

Morphological profiling using machine learning reveals emergent subpopulations of interferon-gamma-stimulated mesenchymal stromal cells that predict immunosuppression	CYTOTHERAPY												Background: Although a preponderance of pre-clinical data demonstrates the immunosuppressive potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), significant heterogeneity and lack of critical quality attributes (CQAs) based on immunosuppressive capacity likely have contributed to inconsistent clinical outcomes. This heterogeneity exists not only between MSC lots derived from different donors, tissues and manufacturing conditions, but also within a given MSC lot in the form of functional subpopulations. We therefore explored the potential of functionally relevant morphological profiling (FRMP) to identify morphological subpopulations predictive of the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs derived from multiple donors, manufacturers and passages. Methods: We profiled the single-cell morphological response of MSCs from different donors and passages to the functionally relevant inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma. We used the machine learning approach visual stochastic neighbor embedding (viSNE) to identify distinct morphological subpopulations that could predict suppression of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in a multiplexed quantitative assay. Results: Multiple IFN-gamma- stimulated subpopulations significantly correlated with the ability of MSCs to inhibit CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation and served as effective CQAs to predict the immunosuppressive capacity of additional manufactured MSC lots. We further characterized the emergence of morphological heterogeneity following IFN-gamma stimulation, which provides a strategy for identifying functional subpopulations for future single-cell characterization and enrichment techniques. Discussion: This work provides a generalizable analytical platform for assessing functional heterogeneity based on single-cell morphological responses that could be used to identify novel CQAs and inform cell manufacturing decisions.

E.			Characterization of extracellular matrix components in the limbal epithelial stem cell compartment	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH												A specialized microenvironment or niche, which regulates maintenance, self-renewal, activation, and proliferation of stem cells by external signals, is one of the key prerequisites for stem cell function. However, the parameters determining the limbal stem cell niche are not yet defined. In order to characterize the role of basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix components in the generation of a microenvironmental niche for limbal stem and progenitor cells, we extensively analyzed the topographical variations of the BM zone of human ocular surface epithelia using immunohistochemistry and a large panel of antibodies to most of the presently described intrinsic and associated BM components. Apart from BM components uniformly expressed throughout all ocular surface epithelia (e.g. type IV collagen alpha 5 and alpha 6 chains, collagen types VII, XV, XVII, and XVIII, laminin-111, laminin-332, laminin chains alpha 3, beta 3,and gamma 2, fibronectin, matrilin-2 and -4, and perlecan), the BM of the limbal epithelium shared many similarities with that of the conjunctival epithelium, including positive labelling for type IV collagen alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains, laminin alpha 5, beta 2, and gamma 1 chains, nidogen-1 and -2, and thrombospondin-4, whereas type IV collagen alpha 3, type V collagen, fibrillin-1 and -2, thrombospondin-1, and endostatin were present in the corneal BM, but lacking or more weakly expressed in the limbal and conjunctival BMs. As compared to both the corneal and conjunctival BMs, the limbal BM showed a markedly increased immunoreactivity for laminin alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 chains, and agrin, and a specific but patchy immunoreactivity for laminin gamma 3 chain, BM40/SPARC, and tenascin-C, which co-localized with ABCG2/p63/K19-positive and K3/Cx43/desmoglein/integrin-alpha 2-negative cell clusters comprising putative stem and early progenitor cells in the basal epithelium of the limbal palisades. Components that were particularly expressed in the corneal-limbal transition zone included type XVI collagen, fibulin-2, tenascin-C/R, vitronectin, bamacan, chondroitin sulfate, and versican, all of which co-localized with vimentin-positive cell clusters comprising putative late progenitor cells in the basal epithelium. This pronounced heterogeneity of the BM in the limbal area, both in the region of limbal palisades and the comeal-limbal transition zone, appears to be involved in providing unique microenviromments for corneal epithelial stem and late progenitor cells. Identification of specific niche parameters might not only help to understand limbal stem cell regulation, but also to improve their selective enrichment and in vitro expansion for therapeutic strategies.

Direct and Progressive Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Into the Chondrogenic Lineage	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY												Treatment of common and debilitating degenerative cartilage diseases particularly osteoarthritis is a clinical challenge because of the limited capacity of the tissue for self-repair. Because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and ability to differentiate into multiple lineages, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potentially powerful tool for repair of cartilage defects. The primary objective of the present study was to develop culture systems and conditions that enable hESCs to directly and uniformly differentiate into the chondrogenic lineage without prior embryoid body (EB) formation, since the inherent cellular heterogeneity of EBs hinders obtaining homogeneous populations of chondrogenic cells that can be used for cartilage repair. To this end, we have subjected undifferentiated pluripotent hESCs to the high density micromass culture conditions we have extensively used to direct the differentiation of embryonic limb bud mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. We report that micromass cultures of pluripotent hESCs undergo direct, rapid, progressive, and substantially uniform chondrogenic differentiation in the presence of BMP2 or a combination of BMP2 and TGF-beta 1, signaling molecules that act in concert to regulate chondrogenesis in the developing limb. The gene expression profiles of hESC-derived cultures harvested at various times during the progression of their differentiation has enabled us to identify cultures comprising cells in different phases of the chondrogenic lineage ranging from cultures just entering the lineage to well differentiated chondrocytes. Thus, we are poised to compare the abilities of hESC-derived progenitors in different phases of the chondrogenic lineage for cartilage repair. J. Cell. Physiol. 224: 664-671, 2010.

Non-coding RNAs repressive role in post-transcriptional processing of RUNX2 during the acquisition of the osteogenic phenotype of periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												Mesenchymal stem cells are candidates for therapeutic strategies in periodontal repair due to their osteogenic potential. In this study, we identified epigenetic markers during osteogenic differentiation, taking advantage of the individual pattern of mesenchymal cells of the periodontal ligament with high (h-PDLCs) and low (1-PDLCs) osteogenic capacity. We found that the involvement of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of the RUNX2 gene is strongly associated with high osteogenic potential. Moreover, we evaluated miRs and genes that encode enzymes to process miRs and their biogenesis. Our data show the high expression of the XPO5 gene, and miRs 7 and 22 observed in the 1-PDLCs might be involved in acquiring osteogenic potential, suppressing RUNX2 gene expression. Further, an inversely proportional correlation between lncRNAs (HOTAIR and HOTTIP) and RUNX2 gene expression was observed in both 1- and h-PDLCs, and it was also related to the distinct osteogenic phenotypes. Thus, our results indicate the low expression of XPO5 in h-PDLC might be the limiting point for blocking the miRs biogenesis, allowing the high gene expression of RUNX2. In accordance, the low expression of miRs, HOTAIR, and HOTTIP could be a prerequisite for increased osteogenic potential in h-PDLCs. These results will help us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of osteogenesis, considering the heterogeneity in the osteogenic potential of PDLCs that might be related to a distinct transcriptional profile of lncRNAs and the biogenesis machinery.

Using single cell RNA sequencing, we here explore the functional and phenotypic heterogeneity of individual transcriptomes of 1167 murine BM mesenchymal stromal cells. These cells exhibit a tremendous heterogeneity of gene expression, which precludes the identification of defined subpopulations. However, according to the expression of 108 genes involved in the communication of stromal cells with hematopoietic cells, we have identified 14 non-overlapping subpopulations, with distinct cytokine or chemokine gene expression signatures. With respect to the maintenance of subsets of immune memory cells by stromal cells, we identified distinct subpopulations expressing Il7, Il15 and Tnfsf13b. Together, this study provides a comprehensive dissection of the BM stromal heterogeneity at the single cell transcriptome level and provides a basis to understand their lifestyle and their role as organizers of niches for the long-term maintenance of immune cells.

DDIT4 regulates mesenchymal stem cell fate by mediating between HIF1 alpha and mTOR signalling	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Stem cell fate decisions to remain quiescent, self-renew or differentiate are largely governed by the interplay between extracellular signals from the niche and the cell intrinsic signal cascades and transcriptional programs. Here we demonstrate that DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) acts as a link between HIF1 alpha and mTOR signalling and regulation of adult stem cell fate. Global gene expression analysis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from single clones and live RNA cell sorting showed a direct correlation between DDIT4 and differentiation potentials of MSC. Loss and gain of function analysis demonstrated that DDIT4 activity is directly linked to regulation of mTOR signalling, expression of pluripotency genes and differentiation. Further we demonstrated that DDIT4 exert these effects down-stream to HIF1 alpha. Our findings provide an insight in regulation of adult stem cells homeostasis by two major pathways with opposing functions to coordinate between states of self-renewal and differentiation.

Despite many setbacks, MSCs have been approved for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease and Crohn disease. However, it is increasingly clear that MSCs exert their therapeutic functions in a paracrine manner through the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) of 50-200 nm in diameter. Unlike living cells that can persist long-term, sEVs are non-living and non-replicative and have a transient presence in the body. Their small size also renders sEV preparations highly amenable to sterilization by filtration. Together, acellular MSC-sEV preparations are potentially safer and easier to translate into the clinic than cellular MSC products. Nevertheless, there are inherent challenges in the development of MSC-sEV drug products. MSC-sEVs are products of living cells, and living cells are sensitive to changes in the external microenvironment. Consequently, quality control metrics to measure key identity and potency features of MSC-sEV preparations have to be specified during development of MSC-sEV therapeutics. The authors have previously described quantifiable assays to define the identity of MSC-sEVs. Here the authors discuss requirements for prospective potency assays to predict the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug substance in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines. Although potency assays should ideally reflect the mechanism of action (MoA), this is challenging because the MoA for the reported efficacy of MSC-sEV preparations against multiple diseases of diverse underlying pathology is likely to be complex and different for each disease and difficult to fully elucidate. Nevertheless, robust potency assays could be developed by identifying the EV attribute most relevant to the intended biological activity in EV-mediated therapy and quantifying the EV attribute. Specifically, the authors highlight challenges and mitigation measures to enhance the manufacture of consistent and reproducibly potent sEV preparations, to identify and select the appropriate EV attribute for potency assays despite a complex "work-in-progress" MoA and to develop assays likely to be compliant with regulatory guidance for assay validation.

Heterogeneous Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Response to Extended Culture in Extracellular Matrices	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) guide differentiation of adult stem cells, but the temporal distribution of differentiation (i.e., heterogeneity) in a given population has not been investigated. We tested the effect of individual ECM proteins on lineage commitment of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) over time. We exposed stem cell populations to ECM proteins representing the primary tissue structures of the body (i.e., collagens type I, III, IV; laminin; and fibronectin) and determined the lineage commitment of the stem cells at 1, 7, and 14 days. We found that collagens that can participate in the formation of fibrils guide differentiation of cardiomyocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts. ECMs of the basement membrane initiate differentiation of cardiomyocytes and osteoblasts but not adipocytes, and small facilitator ECMs (e.g., fibronectin) do not significantly affect stem cell differentiation. Differentiation was ECM-dependent because culture on tissue culture polystyrene, with consistent cell morphology, proliferation, and death, initiated differentiation of osteoblasts only. Thus, we show that ECMs independently trigger differentiation of human adult MSCs and that differentiation in this context can be guided down multiple lineages using the same ECM stimulus. This work highlights the importance of more clearly defining progenitor populations, especially those cultured in the presence of ECMs before transplantation.																	1937-3341	1937-335X				DEC	2009	15	12					3911	3922		10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0603							WOS:000272528400022	19911955

Considerable progress has been made in identification and biological characterisation of cancer stem cells during the past years. Recent biological findings indicate significant inter- and intratumoural and functional heterogeneity of cancer stem cells and lead to more complex models which have potential implications for radiobiology and radiotherapy. Clinical evidence is emerging that biomarkers of cancer stem cells may be prognostic for the outcome of radiotherapy in some tumour entities. Perspectives of cancer stem cell based research for radiotherapy reviewed here include their radioresistance compared to the mass of non-cancer stem cells which form the bulk of all tumour cells, implications for image- and non-image based predictive bio-assays of the outcome of radiotherapy and a combination of novel systemic treatments with radiotherapy.

With this aim, two clones from triple negative breast MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were isolated: One with fibroblast-like appearance (F) and another with semi-epithelial (SE) morphology. Cells of the F clone have a higher migration and tumorigenesis capacity than SE cells, suggesting that these cells are in a more advanced stage of epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. In agreement, F cells have a diminished expression of the tight junction proteins claudins 1 and 4, and an increased content of P-catenin. The latter is due to an augmented activity of the canonical Wnt route and of the EGFR/PI3K/mTORC2/AKT pathway favoring the cytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin and its transcriptional activity. In addition, F cells display increased phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Tyr654 by Src. These changes favor in F cells, the over-expression of Snail that promotes EMT. Finally, we observe that both F and SE cells display markers of cancer stem cells, which are more abundant in the F clone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we show that Small MSCs primed with Hypoxia and Calcium ions (SHC-MSCs) exhibit enhanced stemness and immunomodulatory functions for treating allogeneic conflicts. Compared with naive cultured human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs, SHC-MSCs were resistant to passage-dependent senescence mediated via the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and p53/p21 cascade and secreted large amounts of pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, resulting in suppression of T-cell proliferation. SHC-MSCs showed DNA demethylation in pluripotency, germline, and imprinted genes similarly to very small embryonic-like stem cells, suggesting a potential mutual relationship. Genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses indicated that genes related to immune modulation, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle were up-regulated in SHC-MSCs. Particularly, polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1), zinc-finger protein-143, dehydrogenase/reductase-3, and friend-of-GATA2 play a key role in the beneficial effects of SHC-MSCs. Administration of SHC-MSCs or PLK1-overexpressing MSCs significantly ameliorated symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a humanized mouse model, resulting in significantly improved survival, less weight loss, and reduced histopathologic injuries in GVHD target organs compared with naive MSC-infused mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that SHC-MSCs can improve the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts, including GVHD.

Glioblastoma intra-tumoral heterogeneity and Glioblastoma-Initiating Cells (GICs) challenge the design of effective therapies. We investigated GICs and non-GICs response to RT in a paired in-vitro model and addressed molecular programs activated in GICs after RT. Established GICs heterogeneously expressed several GICs markers and displayed a mesenchymal signature. Upon fractionated RT, GICs reported higher radioresistance compared to non-GICs and showed lower a- and beta-values, according to the Linear Quadratic Model interpretation of the survival curves. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between GICs radiosensitivity and patient disease-free survival. Transcriptome analysis of GICs after acquisition of a radioresistant phenotype reported significant activation of Proneural-to-Mesenchymal transition (PMT) and pro-inflammatory pathways, being STAT3 and IL6 the major players. Our findings support a leading role of mesenchymal GICs in defining patient response to RT and provide the grounds for targeted therapies based on the blockade of inflammatory pathways to overcome GBM radioresistance.				pujana, Miguel Angel/N-3127-2014; Tortosa, Avelina/O-7788-2016; de la Iglesia, Nuria/E-1420-2015	pujana, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-3222-4044; Tortosa, Avelina/0000-0002-9080-2976; de la Iglesia, Nuria/0000-0002-1083-7715													1949-2553				SEP 26	2017	8	43					73640	73653		10.18632/oncotarget.18363							WOS:000411760400025	29088733

BM-MSCs from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been poorly characterized due to disease heterogeneity. We report a functional, genetic, and immunological characterization of BM-MSC cultures from 46 AML patients, stratified by molecular/cytogenetics into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR), and high-risk (HR) subgroups. Stable MSC cultures were successfully established and characterized from 40 of 46 AML patients irrespective of the risk subgroup. AML-derived BM-MSCs never harbored tumor-specific cytogenetic/molecular alterations present in blasts, but displayed higher clonogenic potential than healthy donor (HD)derived BM-MSCs. Although HD-and AML-derived BM-MSCs equally provided chemoprotection to AML cells in vitro, AML-derived BM-MSCs were more immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory, enhanced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Multivariate analysis revealed that the level of interleukin-10 produced by AML-derived BM-MSCs as an independent prognostic factor negatively affected overall survival. Collectively our data show that AML-derived BM-MSCs are not tumor related, but display functional differences contributing to therapy resistance and disease evolution.

However, in actual living tissues, cells should sense cell-scaled heterogeneous elasticity distribution in the extracellular matrix. In this study, to clarify the effect of the cell-scale heterogeneity of matrix-elasticity on durotaxis, we examined the motility of different types of cells on microelastically-striped patterned gels with different cell-sized widths. We found that cells accumulated in stiff regions with specific width on cell-type-dependency, even when a stiffness gradient is too small to induce usual durotaxis with a monotonic stiffness gradient. Fibroblast cells accumulated in a wide stiff region of multicellular size, while mesenchymal stem cells localized in a narrow stiff region of single-cell size. It was revealed that durotactic activity is critically affected not only with the cell type but also with the cell-scale heterogeneity of matrix-elasticity. Based on the shape-fluctuation-based analysis of cell migration, the dynamics of the pseudopodia were found to play a key role in determining the behaviors of general durotaxis.

J	Song, L; Tuan, RS				Song, L; Tuan, RS			Transdifferentiation potential of human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow	FASEB JOURNAL												Transdifferentiation is a process whereby one cell type committed to and progressing along a specific developmental lineage switches into another cell type of a different lineage through genetic reprogramming. Even though this process has been well studied and established in amphibian systems, it is unclear if mammalian cells possess the same potential. Recent in vivo transplantation studies showed that adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were able to differentiate into mesoderm-derived cell types as well as cells with neuroectodermal and endodermal characteristics, suggesting that transdifferentiation occurs in mammalian systems. However, there are concerns over these findings because of the possibility of progenitor cell contamination and cell fusion. In this study, we have developed an in vitro differentiation strategy to assess if human MSCs that have differentiated into a given mesenchyme cell lineage can transdifferentiate into other cell types in response to inductive extracellular cues. Our results showed that fully differentiated cells from hMSCs were capable of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation into cells of another developmental lineage at single cell levels.																	0892-6638					APR	2004	18	6					980	+		10.1096/fj.03-1100fje							WOS:000221108800007	15084518

Using Chromium (TM) technology, scRNA-seq was performed on hUC-MSCs and hSF-MSCs from samples that passed our quality control checks. In order to identify subgroups and activated pathways, several bioinformatics tools were used to analyse the transcriptomic profiles, including clustering, principle components analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), gene set enrichment analysis, as well as Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. scRNA-seq was performed on the two sample sets. In total, there were 104 761 163 reads for the hUC-MSCs and 6 577 715 for the hSF-MSCs, with >60% mapping rate. Based on PCA and t-SNE analyses, we identified 11 subsets within hUC-MSCs and seven subsets within hSF-MSCs. Gene set enrichment analysis determined that there were 533, 57, 32, 44, 10, 319, 731, 1037, 90, 25 and 230 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 11 subsets of hUC-MSCs and 204, 577, 30, 577, 16, 57 and 35 DEGs in the seven subsets of hSF-MSCs. scRNA-seq was not only able to identify subpopulations of hUC-MSCs and hSF-MSCs within the sample sets, but also provided a digital transcript count of hUC-MSCs and hSF-MSCs within a single patient. scRNA-seq analysis may elucidate some of the biological characteristics of MSCs and allow for a better understanding of the multi-directional differentiation, immunomodulatory properties and tissue repair capabilities of MSCs.																	1582-1838	1582-4934				JAN	2020	24	2					1945	1957		10.1111/jcmm.14891		DEC 2019					WOS:000503736600001	31845522

Mouse BMSCs (mBMSCs) are difficult to be cultured and propagated in vitro due to their replicative senescent phenotype, heterogeneity and high contamination with plastic adherent hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs). In this study, we described long-term culture of homogenous population of mBMSCs using simple and highly reproducible approach based on frequent subculturing (FS) at fixed split ratio in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).ResultsCultured mBMSCs using this protocol (mBMSCs-FS) showed long-term survival in culture >70 population doubling (PD) and retained their characteristic surface markers and differentiation capacity into osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. When compared to the clonal bone marrow-derived cell line ST2, mBMSCs-FS displayed more enhanced osteoblast differentiation potential and responsiveness to osteogenic factors including BMPs, IGF-1, PDGF, TGF1,3, FGF, cAMP, Wnt3a and VEGF. In addition, unlike ST2 cells, mBMSCs-FS maintained capacity to form ectopic bone and bone marrow stroma upon in vivo transplantation in immune-compromising mice, even at high PD levels. Interestingly, by applying the same FS+bFGF protocol, we succeeded to obtain long-term cultures of primary neonatal calvarial osteoprogenitor cells (OBs) that were cultured for more than 70 PD and maintained in vitro and in vivo osteoblast differentiation capacities.ConclusionsOur data provide a simple and reliable protocol for generating long-term cultures of mBMSCs and OBs with retained high in vitro and in vivo osteoblast differentiation capacities for use in pre-clinical and molecular mechanism studies.

Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone tumor characterized by biological and molecular heterogeneity, possibly dependent on CSCs. CSC identification in osteosarcoma and their efficient targeting are still open questions. Spontaneous canine osteosarcoma shares clinical and biological features with the human tumors, representing a model for translational studies. We characterized three CSC-enriched canine osteosarcoma cultures. In serum free conditions, these CSC cultures grow as anchorage-independent spheroids, show mesenchymal-like properties and in vivo tumorigenicity, recapitulating the heterogeneity of the original osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma CSCs express stem-related factors (Sox2, Oct4, CD133) and chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR4, CXCL12) involved in tumor proliferation and self-renewal. Standard drugs for osteosarcoma treatment (doxorubicin and cisplatin) affected CSC-enriched and parental primary cultures, showing different efficacy within tumors. Moreover, metformin, a type-2 diabetes drug, significantly inhibits osteosarcoma CSC viability, migration and self-renewal and, in co-treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin, enhances drug cytotoxicity. Collectively, we demonstrate that canine osteosarcoma primary cultures contain CSCs exhibiting distinctive sensitivity to anticancer agents, as a reliable experimental model to assay drug efficacy. We also provide proof-of-principle of metformin efficacy, alone or in combination, as pharmacological strategy to target osteosarcoma CSCs.

PDGF-AB and 5-Azacytidine induce conversion of somatic cells into tissue-regenerative multipotent stem cells	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Current approaches in tissue engineering are geared toward generating tissue-specific stem cells. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of tissues, this approach has its limitations. An alternate approach is to induce terminally differentiated cells to dedifferentiate into multipotent proliferative cells with the capacity to regenerate all components of a damaged tissue, a phenomenon used by salamanders to regenerate limbs. 5-Azacytidine (AZA) is a nucleoside analog that is used to treat preleukemic and leukemic blood disorders. AZA is also known to induce cell plasticity. We hypothesized that AZA-induced cell plasticity occurs via a transient multipotent cell state and that concomitant exposure to a receptive growth factor might result in the expansion of a plastic and proliferative population of cells. To this end, we treated lineage-committed cells with AZA and screened a number of different growth factors with known activity in mesenchyme-derived tissues. Here, we report that transient treatment with AZA in combination with platelet-derived growth factor-AB converts primary somatic cells into tissue-regenerative multipotent stem (iMS) cells. iMS cells possess a distinct transcriptome, are immunosuppressive, and demonstrate long-term self-renewal, serial clonogenicity, and multigerm layer differentiation potential. Importantly, unlike mesenchymal stem cells, iMS cells contribute directly to in vivo tissue regeneration in a context-dependent manner and, unlike embryonic or pluripotent stem cells, do not form teratomas. Taken together, this vector-free method of generating iMS cells from primary terminally differentiated cells has significant scope for application in tissue regeneration.

Integrated Transcriptomic and Glycomic Profiling of Glioma Stem Cell Xenografts	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH												Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have the innate ability to migrate or home toward and engraft in tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM). Because of this unique property of BM-hMSCs, we have explored their use for cell-mediated therapeutic delivery for the advancement of GBM treatment. Extravasation, the process by which blood-borne cells-such as BM-hMSCs-enter the tissue, is a highly complex process but is heavily dependent upon glycosylation for glycan-glycan and glycan-protein adhesion between the cell and endothelium. However, in a translationally significant preclinical glioma stem cell xenograft (GSCX) model of GBM, BM-hMSCs demonstrate unequal tropism toward these tumors. We hypothesized that there may be differences in the glycan compositions between the GSCXs that elicit homing ("attractors") and those that do not ("non-attractors") that facilitate or impede the engraftment of BM-hMSCs in the tumor. In this study, glycotranscriptomic analysis revealed significant heterogeneity within the attractor phenotype and the enrichment of high mannose type N-glycan biosynthesis in the non-attractor phenotype. Orthogonal validation with topical PNGase F deglycosylation on the tumor regions of xenograft tissue, followed by nLC-ESI-MS, confirmed the presence of increased high mannose type N-glycans in the non-attractors. Additional evidence provided by our glycomic study revealed the prevalence of terminal sialic acid-containing N-glycans in non-attractors and terminal galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine N-glycans in attractors. Our results provide the first evidence for differential glycomic profiles in attractor and non-attractor GSCXs and extend the scope of molecular determinates in BM-hMSC homing to glioma.

Quantifying intrinsic and extrinsic control of single-cell fates in cancer and stem/progenitor cell pedigrees with competing risks analysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The molecular control of cell fate and behaviour is a central theme in biology. Inherent heterogeneity within cell populations requires that control of cell fate is studied at the single-cell level. Time-lapse imaging and single-cell tracking are powerful technologies for acquiring cell lifetime data, allowing quantification of how cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors control single-cell fates over time. However, cell lifetime data contain complex features. Competing cell fates, censoring, and the possible interdependence of competing fates, currently present challenges to modelling cell lifetime data. Thus far such features are largely ignored, resulting in loss of data and introducing a source of bias. Here we show that competing risks and concordance statistics, previously applied to clinical data and the study of genetic influences on life events in twins, respectively, can be used to quantify intrinsic and extrinsic control of single-cell fates. Using these statistics we demonstrate that 1) breast cancer cell fate after chemotherapy is dependent on p53 genotype; 2) granulocyte macrophage progenitors and their differentiated progeny have concordant fates; and 3) cytokines promote self-renewal of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells by symmetric divisions. Therefore, competing risks and concordance statistics provide a robust and unbiased approach for evaluating hypotheses at the single-cell level.

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells into fibroblast-like cells in three-dimensional type I collagen gel cultures	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL												Fibroblasts are heterogeneous mesenchymal cells that play important roles in the production and maintenance of extracellular matrix. Although their heterogeneity is recognized, progenitor progeny relationships among fibroblasts and the factors that control fibroblast differentiation are poorly defined. The current study was designed to develop a reliable method that would permit in vitro differentiation of fibroblast-like cells from human and murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Undifferentiated ESCs were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) with differentiation media. EBs were then cast into type I collagen gels and cultured for 21 d with basal media. The spindle-shaped cells that subsequently grew from the EBs were released from the gels and subsequently cultured as monolayers in basal media supplemented with serum. Differentiated cells showed a characteristic spindle-shaped morphology and had ultrastructural features consistent with fibroblasts. Immunocytochemistry showed positive staining for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin but was negative for stage-specific embryonic antigens and cytokeratins. Assays of fibroblast function, including proliferation, chemotaxis, and contraction of collagen gels demonstrated that the differentiated cells, derived from both human and murine ESCs, responded to transforming growth factor-beta 1 and prostaglandin E-2 as would be expected of fibroblasts, functions not expected of endothelial or epithelial cells. The current study demonstrates that cells with the morphologic and functional features of fibroblasts can be reliably derived from human and murine ESCs. This methodology provides a means to investigate and define the mechanisms that regulate fibroblast differentiation.																	1071-2690	1543-706X				FEB	2011	47	2					114	124		10.1007/s11626-010-9367-2							WOS:000287511500005	21107747

Platelet-rich plasma and mesenchymel stem cell therapy offer the potential to modify the natural course of knee osteoarthritis using cell-based technology.

However, cells that are isolated and defined as MSCs comprise a heterogeneous population of progenitors. This heterogeneity can produce variations in the performance of MSCs, especially in applications that require differentiation potential in vivo, such as the treatment of osteoporosis. Here, we aimed to identify genetic markers in tonsil-derived MSCs (T-MSCs) that can predict osteogenic potential. Using a single-cell cloning method, we isolated and established several lines of nondifferentiating (ND) or osteoblast-prone (OP) clones. Next, we performed transcriptome sequencing of three ND and three OP clones that maintained the characteristics of MSCs and determined the top six genes that were upregulated in OP clones. Upregulation of WNT16 and DCLK1 expression was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR, but only WNT16 expression was correlated with the osteogenic differentiation of T-MSCs from 10 different donors. Collectively, our findings suggest that WNT16 is a putative genetic marker that predicts the osteogenic potential of T-MSCs. Thus, examination of WNT16 expression as a selection criterion prior to the clinical application of MSCs may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell therapy for bone-related complications, including osteoporosis.

WAT itself can be divided into subcutaneous and internal fat deposits. All these tissues have been shown to present a great tissue plasticity, and recent data emphasized on the multiple differentiation potentials obtained from subcutaneous WAT. However, no study has compared the heterogeneity of stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) cells and their differentiation potentials according to the localization of the fat pad. This study clearly demonstrates that WAT and BAT present different antigenic features and differentiation potentials. WAT by contrast to BAT contains a large population of hematopoietic cells composed essentially of macrophages and hematopoietic progenitor cells. in WAT, the nonhematopoietic population is mainly composed of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like but contains also a significant proportion of immature cells, whereas in BAT, the stromal cells do not present the same phenotype. Internal and subcutaneous WAT present some discrete differences in the phenotype of their cell populations. WAT derived SVF cells give rise to osteoblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, hematopoietic cells, and cardiomyoblasts only from inguinal cells. By contrast, BAT derived SVF cells display a reduced plasticity. Adipose tissues thus appear as complex tissues composed of different cell subsets according to the location of fat pads. Inguinal WAT appears as the most plastic adipose tissue and represents a potential and suitable source of stem cell, considering its easy sampling as a major advantage for cell therapy.

Hallmarks are extensive intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity and highly invasive growth, which provide great challenges for treatment. Efficient therapy is lacking and the majority of patients survive less than 1 year from diagnosis. GBM progression and recurrence is caused by treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). GSC cultures are considered important models in target identification and drug screening studies. The current state-of-the-art method, to isolate and maintain GSC cultures that faithfully mimic the primary tumor, is to use serum-free (SF) media conditions developed for neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we have investigated the outcome of explanting 218 consecutively collected GBM patient samples under both SF and standard, serum-containing media conditions. The frequency of maintainable SF cultures (SFCs) was most successful, but for a subgroup of GBM specimens, a viable culture could only be established in serum-containing media, called exclusive serum culture (ESC). ESCs expressed nestin and SOX2, and displayed all functional characteristics of a GSC, that is, extended proliferation, sustained self-renewal and orthotopic tumor initiation. Once adapted to the in vitro milieu they were also sustainable in SF media. Molecular analyses showed that ESCs formed a discrete group that was most related to the mesenchymal GBM subtype. This distinct subgroup of GBM that would have evaded modeling in SF conditions only provide unique cell models of GBM inter-tumor heterogeneity.

Transient Canonical Wnt Stimulation Enriches Human Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cell Isolates for Osteoprogenitors	STEM CELLS												Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is an attractive anabolic therapeutic strategy for bone. Emerging data suggest that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway promotes bone mineral accrual in osteoporotic patients. The effect of Wnt stimulation in fracture healing is less clear as Wnt signaling has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on osteogenesis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that transient Wnt stimulation promotes the expansion and osteogenesis of a Wnt-responsive stem cell population present in human bone marrow. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated from patients undergoing hip arthroplasty and exposed to Wnt3A protein. The effect of Wnt pathway stimulation was determined by measuring the frequency of stem cells within the BMMNC populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and colony forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays, before determining their osteogenic capacity in in vitro differentiation experiments. We found that putative skeletal stem cells in BMMNC isolates exhibited elevated Wnt pathway activity compared with the population as whole. Wnt stimulation resulted in an increase in the frequency of skeletal stem cells marked by the STRO-1(bright)/Glycophorin A(-) phenotype. Osteogenesis was elevated in stromal cell populations arising from BMMNCs transiently stimulated by Wnt3A protein, but sustained stimulation inhibited osteogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that Wnt stimulation could be used as a therapeutic approach by transient targeting of stem cell populations during early fracture healing, but that inappropriate stimulation may prevent osteogenesis.				; Newman, Tracey A/I-8884-2012; Oreffo, Richard/A-4615-2011	Evans, Nicholas/0000-0002-3255-4388; Janeczek, Agnieszka/0000-0002-9745-8346; Newman, Tracey A/0000-0002-3727-9258; Scarpa, Edoardo/0000-0002-5886-6929; Tare, Rahul/0000-0001-8274-8837; Oreffo, Richard/0000-0001-5995-6726												1066-5099	1549-4918				FEB	2016	34	2					418	430		10.1002/stem.2241							WOS:000370353200015	26573091

Although several possible explanations have been proposed, including different numbers of injected and engrafted MSCs, heterogeneity in phenotype, and function of tumor cells, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for opposite effects of MSCs in modulation of antitumor immunity are still unknown. Herewith, we used a B16F10 murine melanoma model to investigate whether timing of MSC administration in tumor-bearing mice was crucially important for their effects on antitumor immunity. MSCs, intravenously injected 24 h after melanoma induction (B16F10+MSC1d-treated mice), significantly enhanced natural killer (NK) and T cell-driven antitumor immunity, suppressed tumor growth, and improved survival of melanoma-bearing animals. Significantly higher plasma levels of antitumorigenic cytokines (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma), remarkably lower plasma levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-beta and IL-10), and a significantly higher number of tumor-infiltrating, IFN-gamma-producing, FasL- and granzyme B-expressing NK cells, IL-17-producing CD4+Th17 cells, IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-producing CD4+Th1 cells, and CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were observed in B16F10+MSC1d-treated mice. On the contrary, MSCs, injected 14 days after melanoma induction (B16F10+MSC14d-treated mice), promoted tumor growth by suppressing antigen-presenting properties of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages and by reducing tumoricidal capacity of NK cells and T lymphocytes. Significantly higher plasma levels of TGF-beta and IL-10, remarkably lower plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, and significantly reduced number of tumor-infiltrating, I-A-expressing, and IL-12-producing macrophages, CD80- and I-A-expressing DCs, granzyme B-expressing CTLs and NK cells, IFN-gamma- and IL-17-producing CTLs, CD4+Th1, and Th17 cells were observed in B16F10+MSC14d-treated animals. In summing up, the timing of MSC administration into the tumor microenvironment was crucially important for MSC-dependent modulation of antimelanoma immunity. MSCs transplanted during the initial phase of melanoma growth exerted tumor-suppressive effect, while MSCs injected during the progressive stage of melanoma development suppressed antitumor immunity and enhanced tumor expansion.

However, the extent to which individual, patient-derived BTIC lines reflect the heterogeneity of GBM remains poorly understood. Here we applied a stem cell biology approach and compared self-renewal, marker expression, label retention, and asymmetric cell division in 20 BTIC lines. Through cluster analysis, we identified two subgroups of BTIC lines with distinct precursor states, stem- or progenitor-like, predictive of survival after xenograft. Moreover, stem and progenitor transcriptomic signatures were identified, which showed a strong association with the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, respectively, in the TCGA cohort. This study proposes a different framework for the study and use of BTIC lines and provides precursor biology insights into GBM.

Indeed, mesenchymal (MSCs) and neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) together constitute the bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) that were used as therapeutic options in various models of experimental SCI. However, as clinical approaches remained disappointing, we thought that reducing BMSC heterogeneity should be a potential way to improve treatment efficiency and reproducibility. Methods: We investigated the impact of pure populations of MSCs and NCSCs isolated from adult bone marrow in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. We then analyzed the secretome of both MSCs and NCSCs, and its effect on macrophage migration in vitro. Results: We first observed that both cell types induced motor recovery in mice, and modified the inflammatory reaction in the lesion site. We also demonstrated that NCSCs but especially MSCs were able to secrete chemokines and attract macrophages in vitro. Finally, it appears that MSC injection in the spinal cord enhance early inflammatory events in the blood and spinal cord of SCI mice. Conclusions: Altogether, our results suggest that both cell types have beneficial effects in experimental SCI, and that further investigation should be dedicated to the regulation of the inflammatory reaction following SCI, in the context of stem cell-based therapy but also in the early-phase clinical management of SCI patients.

J	Labriola, NR; Darling, EM				Labriola, Nicholas R.; Darling, Eric M.			Temporal heterogeneity in single-cell gene expression and mechanical properties during adipogenic differentiation	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS												Adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) respond heterogeneously when exposed to lineage-specific induction medium. Variable responses at the single-cell level can be observed in the production of lineage-specific metabolites, expression of mRNA transcripts, and adoption of mechanical phenotypes. Understanding the relationship between the biological and mechanical characteristics for individual ASCs is crucial for interpreting how cellular heterogeneity affects the differentiation process. The goal of the current study was to monitor the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPARG) in adipogenically differentiating ASC populations over two weeks, while also characterizing the expression-associated mechanical properties of individual cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results showed that ASC mechanical properties did not change significantly over time in either adipogenic or control medium; however, cells expressing PPARG exhibited significantly greater compliance and fluidity compared to those lacking expression in both adipogenic and control media environments. The percent of PPARG+ cells in adipogenic samples increased over time but stayed relatively constant in controls. Previous reports of a slow, gradual change in cellular mechanical properties are explained by the increase in the number of positively differentiating cells in a sample rather than being reflective of actual, single-cell mechanical property changes. Cytoskeletal remodeling was more prevalent in adipogenic samples than controls, likely driving the adoption of a more compliant mechanical phenotype and upregulation of PPARG. The combined results reinforce the importance of understanding single-cell characteristics, in the context of heterogeneity, to provide more accurate interpretations of biological phenomena such as stem cell differentiation.

However, the electrophysiological effects of MSC transplantation have not been studied. Although improvement of ventricular function would represent a positive outcome of MSC transplantation, focal application of stem cells has the potential downside of creating inhomogeneities that may predispose the heart to reentrant arrhythmias. In the present study we use an MSC and neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) coculture system to investigate potential proarrhythmic consequences of MSC transplantation into the heart. Methods and Results - Human MSCs were cocultured with NRVMs in ratios of 1: 99, 1: 9, and 1: 4 and optically mapped. We found that conduction velocity was decreased in cocultures compared with controls, but action potential duration (APD(80)) was not affected. Reentrant arrhythmias were induced in 86% of cocultures containing 10% and 20% MSCs (n = 36) but not in controls ( n = 7) or cocultures containing only 1% MSCs ( n = 4). Immunostaining, Western blot, and dye transfer revealed the presence of functional gap junctions involving MSCs. Conclusions - Our results suggest that mixtures of MSCs and NRVMs can produce an arrhythmogenic substrate. The mechanism of reentry is probably increased tissue heterogeneity resulting from electric coupling of inexcitable MSCs with myocytes.																	0009-7322	1524-4539				APR 18	2006	113	15					1832	1841		10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.593038							WOS:000236865100007	16606790

A Purification Technique for Adipose-Derived Stromal Cell Cultures Leads to a More Regenerative Cell Population	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY												It has been demonstrated that adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are a regenerative cell population with potential uses for bone and cartilage regeneration. However, the biomarker expression and heterogeneity of the population has not been thoroughly characterized. By analyzing biomarker expression, we aimed to understand the composition of ASC populations extracted using a common extraction technique in comparison to ASC populations given an additional purification step. Human adipose tissue samples were collected, and ASCs were extracted from these samples using a common, published extraction technique (primary extraction). These cells were cultured and half were given an additional purification. The primarily-extracted and purified cell populations were analyzed for biomarkers that correspond to specific cell types. The addition of the purification technique reduced the number of cells expressing hematopoietic and endothelial biomarkers and did not cause the yield of mesenchymal stem cell biomarker-expressing cells to decrease. Biomarkers corresponding to erythrocytes and lymphocytes were lost during the primary extraction, and biomarkers corresponding to most granulocytes and progenitor cells were lost during the additional purification. Biomarkers identifying dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and pericytes were upregulated in purified cell populations while those identifying fibroblasts and adipocytes were downregulated. Pluripotency biomarkers were more highly expressed in purified cell populations. These results demonstrate that the most commonly utilized adipose tissue recovery and ASC extraction technique leads to a heterogeneous cell population in which further purification of this population, as described in this manuscript, isolates a cell subset that has more regenerative potential.																	0894-1939	1521-0553				JUL 4	2019	32	5					381	392		10.1080/08941939.2017.1423420							WOS:000478887200001	29388858					
J	Zhang, ZZ; Zheng, TY; Zhu, R				Zhang, Zhizhong; Zheng, Tianyang; Zhu, Rong			Microchip with Single-Cell Impedance Measurements for Monitoring Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells under Electrical Stimulation	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Effective induction methods and in situ monitoring are essential for studying the mechanism of biological responses in stem cell differentiation. This article proposes an induction method incorporating electrical stimulation under an inhomogeneous field with single-cell impedance monitoring for studying osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using a microchip. The microchip contains an array of sextupole-electrode units for implementing a combination of controllable electrical stimulation and single-cell impedance measurements. MSCs are inducted to osteogenic differentiation under electrical stimulation using quadrupole electrodes and single-cell impedances are monitored in situ using a pair of microelectrodes at each unit center. The proposed microchip adopts an array design to monitor a number of MSCs in parallel, which improves measurement throughput and facilitates to carry out statistic tests. We perform osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on the microchip with and without electrical stimulation meanwhile monitoring single-cell impedance in real time for 21 days. The recorded impedance results show the detailed characteristic change of MSCs at the single-cell level during osteogenic differentiation, which demonstrates a significant difference between the conditions with and without electrical stimulation. The cell morphology and various staining analyses are also used to validate osteogenesis and correlate with the impedance expression. Correlation analysis of the impedance measurement, cell morphology, and various staining assays proves the great acceleration effect of the proposed electrical stimulation on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The proposed impedance method can monitor the dynamic process of cell development and study heterogeneity of stem cell differentiation at the single-cell level.

However, it is unclear whether the characteristics of MSCs are altered in different disease states. In this study, we obtained and expanded MSCs from bone marrow of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin disease (HD), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Our results showed that MSCs derived from ALL, HD, and NHL were similar to normal adult bone marrow-derived MSCs in morphology, growth properties, surface epitopes, and differentiation ability in vitro. Moreover, MSCs derived from ALL, NHL, and HD had a normal karyotype and ultrastructure. These cells could express hematopoietic cytokines and support hematopoiesis in long-term culture. However, adherent cells isolated from bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed abnormal biological properties, including heterogeneity in morphology, limited proliferation capacity, and impaired differentiation and hematopoiesis support ability. These results indicate that there are differences in the characteristics of adherent cells derived from different disease states, which may be important for reasonable MSC selection in stem cell-based therapy.																	1547-3287	1557-8534				AUG	2007	16	4					637	648		10.1089/scd.2007.0008							WOS:000249266800012	17784837

The Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) theory holds that there is a subset of tumor cells within the tumor that have stem-like characteristics, including the capacity to maintain the tumor and to resist multidrug chemotherapy. Therefore, a better understanding of OS biology and pathogenesis is needed in order to advance the development of targeted therapies to eradicate this particular subset and to reduce morbidity and mortality among patients. Isolating CSCs, establishing cell cultures of CSCs, and studying their biology are important steps to improving our understanding of OS biology and pathogenesis. The establishment of human-derived OS-CSCs from biopsies of OS has been made possible using several methods, including the capacity to create 3-dimensional stem cell cultures under nonadherent conditions. Under these conditions, CSCs are able to create spherical floating colonies formed by daughter stem cells; these colonies are termed "cellular spheres". Here, we describe a method to establish CSC cultures from primary cell cultures of conventional OS obtained from OS biopsies. We clearly describe the several passages required to isolate and characterize CSCs.

J	Iliopoulos, D; Hirsch, HA; Wang, GN; Struhl, K				Iliopoulos, Dimitrios; Hirsch, Heather A.; Wang, Guannan; Struhl, Kevin			Inducible formation of breast cancer stem cells and their dynamic equilibrium with non-stem cancer cells via IL6 secretion	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Tumors are often heterogeneous, being composed of multiple cell types with different phenotypic and molecular properties. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are a highly tumorigenic cell type found in developmentally diverse tumors or cancer cell lines, and they are often resistant to standard chemotherapeutic drugs. The origins of CSCs and their relationships to nonstem cancer cells (NSCCs) are poorly understood. In an inducible breast oncogenesis model, CSCs are generated from nontransformed cells at a specific time during the transformation process, but CSC formation is not required for transformation. MicroRNA profiles indicate that CSCs and NSCCs are related, but different cell types arising from a common nontransformed population. Interestingly, medium from the transformed population stimulates NSCCs to become CSCs, and conversion of NSCCs to CSCs occurs in mouse xenografts. Furthermore, IL6 is sufficient to convert NSCCs to CSCs in genetically different breast cell lines, human breast tumors, and a prostate cell line. Thus, breast and prostate CSCs and NSCCs do not represent distinct epigenetic states, and these CSCs do not behave as or arise from classic stem cells. Instead, tumor heterogeneity involves a dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and NSCCs mediated by IL6 and activation of the inflammatory feedback loop required for oncogenesis. This dynamic equilibrium provides an additional rationale for combining conventional chemotherapy with metformin, which selectively inhibits CSCs.

However, donor-to-donor variability, cell heterogeneity, inconsistent chondrogenic potential, and limited expansion potential can hinder the use of these cells for modeling chondrogenesis, in vitro screening of drugs and treatments for joint diseases, or translational applications for tissue engineered cartilage repair. The goal of this study was to create an immortalized ASC line that showed enhanced and consistent chondrogenic potential for applications in cartilage tissue engineering as well as to provide a platform for investigation of biological and mechanobiological pathways involved in cartilage homeostasis and disease. Starting with the ASC52telo cell line, a hTERT-immortalized ASC line, we used lentivirus to overexpress SOX9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis, and screened several clonal populations of SOX9 overexpressing cells to forma new stable cell line with high chondrogenic potential. One clonal line, named ASC52telo-SOX9, displayed increased GAG and type II collagen synthesis and was found to be responsive to both mechanical and inflammatory stimuli in a manner similar to native chondrocytes. The development of a clonal line such as ASC52telo-SOX9 has the potential to be a powerful tool for studying cartilage homeostasis and disease mechanisms in vitro, and potentially as a platform for in vitro drug screening for diseases that affect articular cartilage. Our findings provide an approach for the development of other immortalized cell lines with improved chondrogenic capabilities in ASCs or other adult stem cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

CTGF directs fibroblast differentiation from human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells and defines connective tissue healing in a rodent injury model	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION												Fibroblasts are ubiquitous cells that demonstrate remarkable diversity. However, their origin and pathways of differentiation remain poorly defined. Here, we show that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; also known as CCN2) is sufficient to induce human bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) to differentiate into fibroblasts. CTGF-stimulated MSCs lost their surface mesenchymal epitopes, expressed broad fibroblastic hallmarks, and increasingly synthesized collagen type I and tenacin-C. After fibroblastic commitment, the ability of MSCs to differentiate into nonfibroblastic lineages - including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes - was diminished. To address inherent heterogeneity in MSC culture, we established 18 single MSC-derived clones by limiting dilution. CTGF-treated MSCs were alpha-SMA(-), differentiating into alpha-SMA(+) myofibroblasts only when stimulated subsequently with TGF-beta 1, suggestive of stepwise processes of fibroblast commitment, fibrogenesis, and pathological fibrosis. In rats, in vivo microencapsulated delivery of CTGF prompted postnatal connective tissue to undergo fibrogenesis rather than ectopic mineralization. The knowledge that fibroblasts have a mesenchymal origin may enrich our understanding of organ fibrosis, cancer stroma, ectopic mineralization, scarring, and regeneration.																	0021-9738	1558-8238				SEP	2010	120	9					3340	3349		10.1172/JCI43230							WOS:000281458800036	20679726

Studies of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are widely employed to investigate the effects of a large variety of substances. We assayed the cAMP pathway in human skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSC) to evaluate donor to donor variations in response to pharmacological manipulations in vitro. Immunophenotyping of S-MSC revealed that, in general, 95% of S-MSCs were positive for CD90, CD73 and CD105 and negative for the expression of haemopoetic markers CD14, CD45 and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR). Nevertheless, fluctuations occurred in basal cAMP levels from 5 pmol/mg to 18 pmol/mg. Total cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) concentrations ranged from 0.8 ng/ml to 1 ng/ml, whereas the proportions of phospho-CREB versus total CREB differed between the cell lines. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated cAMP generation, whereas leukaemia inhibiting factor reduced some of their effects. Forskolin (0.05 and 1 mM) acted in synergy with FGF-2 and EGF; however, it caused pronounced donor to donor differences in the increase of cAMP and phospho-CREB levels. Additionally, dibutyryl-cAMP caused significant donor to donor variations in cell proliferation, possibly indicating a change of cell differentiation status. We speculate that similar donor diversity might be observed after cell stimulation with various G(s)-protein-coupled receptor ligands. Heterogeneity of donor cell responses to stimulation of the cAMP pathway indicates the need for wide safety margins for S-MSC use in drug screening; nevertheless, knowledge of this heterogeneity might be useful for the design of donor-specific cell therapy.

Microfluidic Separation of Canine Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are potential treatments for a variety of veterinary medical conditions. However, clinical trials have often fallen short of expectations, due in part to heterogeneity and lack of characterization of the MSCs. Identification and characterization of subpopulations within MSC cultures may improve those outcomes. Therefore, the functional heterogeneity of different-sized subpopulations of MSCs was evaluated. A high-throughput, biophysical, label-free microfluidic sorting approach was used to separate subpopulations of canine adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSCs) based on size for subsequent characterization, as well as to evaluate the impact of culture conditions on their functional heterogeneity. We found that culture-expanded canine Ad-MSCs comprise distinct subpopulations: larger MSCs (mean diameter of 18.6 +/- 0.2 mu m), smaller MSCs (mean diameter of 15.3 +/- 0.2 mu m), and intermediate MSCs (mean diameter of 16.9 +/- 0.1 mu m). In addition, proliferation characteristics, senescence, and differentiation potential of canine Ad-MSCs are also dependent on cell size. We observed that larger MSCs proliferate more slowly, senesce at earlier passages, and are inclined to differentiate into adipocytes compared with smaller MSCs. Most importantly, these size-dependent functions are also affected by the presence of serum in the culture medium, as well as time in culture. Cell surface staining for MSC-specific CD44 and CD90 antigens showed that all subpopulations of MSCs are indistinguishable, suggesting that this criterion is not relevant to define subpopulations of MSCs. Finally, transcriptome analysis showed differential gene expression between larger and smaller subpopulations of MSCs. Larger MSCs expressed genes involved in cellular senescence such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and smaller MSCs expressed genes that promote cell growth [mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) pathway] and cell proliferation [myelocytomatosis (myc), e2f targets]. These results suggest that different subpopulations of MSCs have specific properties. Impact statement Clinical trials of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from veterinary species have often fallen short of expectations, due in part to heterogeneity and lack of characterization of the MSCs. A high-throughput, biophysical, label-free microfluidic sorting approach was used to separate subpopulations of canine adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSCs) based on size for subsequent characterization. Proliferation characteristics, senescence, and differentiation potential of canine Ad-MSCs are also dependent on cell size. Cell surface staining for MSC-specific cell surface markers showed that all subpopulations of MSCs are indistinguishable, suggesting that this criterion is not relevant to define subpopulations of MSCs.																	1937-3384	1937-3392				AUG 1	2021	27	8					445	461		10.1089/ten.tec.2021.0082							WOS:000686738600001	34155926

Gopalakrishna			Targeting Cancer Stem Cell Plasticity Through Modulation of Epidermal Growth Factor and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor Signaling in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												Emerging data suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist in equilibrium with differentiated cells and that stochastic transitions between these states can account for tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. The aim of this study was to establish an in vitro system that recapitulates stem cell plasticity in head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs) and identify the factors that play a role in the maintenance and repopulation of CSCs. Tumor spheres were established using patient-derived cell lines via anchorage-independent cell culture techniques. These tumor spheres were found to have higher aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD) cell fractions and increased expression of Kruppel-like factor 4, SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2, and Nanog and were resistant to gamma-radiation, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and etoposide treatment compared with monolayer culture cells. Monolayer cultures were subject to single cell cloning to generate clones with high and low ALD fractions. ALD(High) clones showed higher expression of stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers compared with ALD(Low) clones. ALD fractions, representing stem cell fractions, fluctuated with serial passaging, equilibrating at a level specific to each cell line, and could be augmented by the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or insulin. ALD(High) clones showed increased EGF receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) phosphorylation, with increased activation of downstream pathways compared with ALD(Low) clones. Importantly, blocking these pathways using specific inhibitors against EGFR and IGF-1R reduced stem cell fractions drastically. Taken together, these results show that HNSCC CSCs exhibit plasticity, with the maintenance of the stem cell fraction dependent on the EGFR and IGF-1R pathways and potentially amenable to targeted therapeutics.

Checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant success in cancer treatment, but expression of key factors such as PD-L1 in putative cancer stem cell (CSC) populations in squamous cell carcinoma has been inconclusive, suggesting that CSCs may have developed other mechanisms to escape immune surveillance. Here we show that CSCs upregulate the immune checkpoint molecule CD276 (B7-H3) to evade host immune responses. CD276 is highly expressed by CSCs in mouse and human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and can be used to prospectively isolate tumorigenic CSCs. Anti-CD276 antibodies eliminate CSCs in a CD8(+) T cell-dependent manner, inhibiting tumor growth and lymph node metastases in a mouse HNSCC model. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that CD276 blockade remodels SCC heterogeneity and reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results show that CSCs utilize CD276 for immune escape and suggest that targeting CD276 may reduce CSCs in HNSCC.																	1934-5909	1875-9777				SEP 2	2021	28	9					1597	+		10.1016/j.stem.2021.04.011							WOS:000692518000010	33945793

Cell-Surface Expression of Neuron-Glial Antigen 2 (NG2) and Melanoma Cell Adhesion Molecule (CD146) in Heterogeneous Cultures of Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Cellular heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) impedes their use in regenerative medicine. The objective of this research is to identify potential biomarkers for the enrichment of progenitors from heterogeneous MSC cultures. To this end, the present study examines variation in expression of neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (CD146) on the surface of MSCs derived from human bone marrow in response to culture conditions and among cell populations. Multipotent cells isolated from heterogeneous MSC cultures exhibit a greater than three-fold increase in surface expression for NG2 and greater than two-fold increase for CD146 as compared with parental and lineage-committed MSCs. For both antigens, surface expression is downregulated by greater than or equal to six-fold when MSCs become confluent. During serial passage, maximum surface expression of NG2 and CD146 is associated with minimum doubling time. Upregulation of NG2 and CD146 during loss of adipogenic potential at early passage suggests some limits to their utility as potency markers. A potential relationship between proliferation and antigen expression was explored by sorting heterogeneous MSCs into rapidly and slowly dividing groups. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that rapidly dividing MSCs display lower scatter and 50% higher NG2 surface expression than slowly dividing cells, but CD146 expression is comparable in both groups. Heterogeneous MSCs were sorted based on scatter properties and surface expression of NG2 and CD146 into high (HI) and low (LO) groups. Sc(LO)NG2(HI) and Sc(LO)NG2(HI)CD146(HI) MSCs have the highest proliferative potential of the sorted groups, with colony-forming efficiencies that are 1.5-2.2 times the value for the parental controls. The Sc-LO gate enriches for rapidly dividing cells. Addition of the NG2(HI) gate increases cell survival to 1.5 times the parental control. Further addition of the CD146(HI) gate does not significantly improve cell division or survival. The combination of low scatter and high NG2 surface expression is a promising selection criterion to enrich a proliferative phenotype from heterogeneous MSCs during ex vivo expansion, with potentially numerous applications.

J	Lu, SL; Qiao, XH				Lu, Shuanglong; Qiao, Xiaohong			Single-cell profiles of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells after IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha licensing	GENE												Background: Pre-licensing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha can empower their immune fate and induce a more effective immune regulation. However, the cellular heterogeneity of MSCs limits our understanding of this inflammatory licensing. Methods: The publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human bone marrow-derived MSCs with or without IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha licensing were analyzed. Based on the scRNA-seq data and related marker genes, the cell-cycle, stemness, differentiative potencies, and immunomodulate capability of unlicensed and licensed MSCs were compared. Results: After removing low-quality cells and regressing out the ribosomal gene effects, high-quality data reflecting IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha effect on MSCs were chosen for further analysis. Despite the heterogeneity, prelicensing didn't influence the cell-cycle and stemness of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The osteogenesis potencies were decreased, the chondrogenesis potencies were increased while the adipogenesis potencies were stable in licensed MSCs. Licensed MSCs also showed more effective immunomodulate capability including expression of related chemokines, cytokines, surface molecules, and receptors. Conclusion: Collectively, our study showed the expression profiles of human bone marrow-derived unlicensed and licensed MSCs about the cell cycle, stemness, differentiative potencies, and immunomodulate capability at single-cell resolution, which may help the comprehensive understanding about the inflammatory licensing of human bone marrow-derived MSCs and their further clinical application.																	0378-1119	1879-0038				MAR 1	2021	771								145347	10.1016/j.gene.2020.145347							WOS:000609525300004	33333228

Concurrent therapy with surgical removal of primary and metastatic lesions is the main approach for cancer therapy. Currently, therapeutic resistant properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to drive malignant cancer progression, including metastasis. Our study aimed to identify molecular tools dedicated to the detection and treatment of CSCs. We confirmed that microRNA-210-3p (miR-210) was upregulated in colorectal stem-like cancer cells, which targeted stathmin1 (STMN1), to decrease cell elasticity for increasing mobility. We envision that strategies for softening cellular elasticity will reduce the onset of CSC-orientated metastasis. Cell migration is critical for regional dissemination and distal metastasis of cancer cells, which remain the major causes of poor prognosis and death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular deformability contribute to the migration of cancer cells and metastasis, the mechanisms governing the migratory ability of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a nongenetic source of tumor heterogeneity, are unclear. Here, we expanded colorectal CSCs (CRCSCs) as colonospheres and showed that CRCSCs exhibited higher cell motility in transwell migration assays and 3D invasion assays and greater deformability in particle tracking microrheology than did their parental CRC cells. Mechanistically, in CRCSCs, microRNA-210-3p (miR-210) targeted stathmin1 (STMN1), which is known for inducing microtubule destabilization, to decrease cell elasticity in order to facilitate cell motility without affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status. Clinically, the miR-210-STMN1 axis was activated in CRC patients with liver metastasis and correlated with a worse clinical outcome. This study elucidates a miRNA-oriented mechanism regulating the deformability of CRCSCs beyond the EMT process.

Osteogenic differentiation of two distinct subpopulations of human adipose-derived stem cells: an in vitro and in vivo study	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE												The first stem cells considered for the reconstruction of bone were bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Subsequently, cells with similar marker expression panel and differentiation potential were found in new sources of cells, such as adipose tissue. This source of stem cells has a promising future in tissue-engineering applications, considering the abundance of this tissue in the human body, the easy harvesting and the high number of stem cells that are available from such a small amount of tissue. The isolation of the adipose stem cells is generally performed by means of enzymatic digestion of the tissues, followed by a natural selection of the stem cells based on their capacity to adhere to the culture flasks, leading to a quite heterogeneous population. This constitutes a major drawback for the use of these cells, since the heterogeneity of the cell culture obtained can compromise their proliferation and differentiation potential. In the present study we have analysed the in vitro and in vivo behaviour of two selected subpopulations with high osteogenic potential. For this purpose, ASCs(CD29+) and ASCs(STRO-1+) subpopulations were isolated and in vitro cultured onto a biodegradable polymeric scaffold, using osteogenic medium, before implantation in a nude mice model. The biodegradable polymeric scaffold used is a fibre-mesh structure based on a blend of starch and polycaprolatone (SPCL) that has been successfully used in several bone tissue-engineering studies. The implanted ASCsscaffold constructs promoted the formation of new bone tissue in nude mice. However, the results obtained show differences in the behaviour of the two ASCs subpopulations under study, particularly regarding their potential to differentiate into the osteogenic lineage, and allowed the indentification of ASCs(STRO-1+) as the best subpopulation for bone tissue-engineering applications.

Automated microscopy as a quantitative method to measure differences in adipogenic differentiation in preparations of human mesenchymal stromal cells	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Multipotent stromal cells, also called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), are potentially valuable as a cellular therapy because of their differentiation and immunosuppressive properties. As the result of extensive heterogeneity of MSCs, quantitative approaches to measure differentiation capacity between donors and passages on a per-cell basis are needed. Methods. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were expanded to passages P3, P5 and P7 from eight different donors and were analyzed for colony-forming unit capacity (CPU), cell size, surface marker expression and forward/side-scatter analysis by flow cytometry. Adipogenic differentiation potential was quantified with the use of automated microscopy. Percentage of adipogenesis was determined by quantifying nuclei and Nile red positive adipocytes after automated image acquisition. Results. MSCs varied in expansion capacity and increased in average cell diameter with passage. CFU capacity decreased with passage and varied among cell lines within the same passage. The number of adipogenic precursors varied between cell lines, ranging from 0.5% to 13.6% differentiation at P3. Adipogenic capacity decreased significantly with increasing passage. MSC cell surface marker analysis revealed no changes caused by passaging or donor differences. Conclusions. We measured adipogenic differentiation on a per-cell basis with high precision and accuracy with the use of automated fluorescence microscopy. We correlated these findings with other quantitative bioassays to better understand the role of donor variability and passaging on CPU, cell size and adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. These quantitative approaches provide valuable tools to measure MSC quality and measure functional biological differences between donors and cell passages that are not revealed by conventional MSC cell surface marker analysis.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have prominent ability in immunomodulation and have been applicated on treating many immune-related diseases. However, the clinical outcomes can be disparate and sometimes completely counterproductive beyond explanation of cell heterogeneity. The theory of immunomodulation plasticity in MSCs has then emerged to explain that MSCs can be induced into proinflammatory MSC1 or anti-inflammatory MSC2 responding to different immune environment. It would be safer and more efficient if we could induce MSCs into a certain immune phenotype, in most cases MSC2, prior to medical treatment. In this study, we screened and identified a classical FDA-approved drug, chlorzoxazone (CZ). Unlike traditional method induced by IFN-gamma, CZ can induce MSC into MSC2 phenotype and enhance the immunosuppressive capacity without elevation of immunogenicity of MSCs. CZ-treated MSCs can better inhibit T cells activation and proliferation, promote expression of IDO and other immune mediators in vitro, and alleviate inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage in acute kidney injury rat model more effectively. Moreover, we discovered that CZ modulates phosphorylation of transcriptional factor forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) independent of classical AKT or ERK signaling pathways, to promote expression of downstream immune-related genes, therefore contributing to augmentation of MSCs immunosuppressive capacity. Our study established a novel and effective approach to induce MSC2, which is ready for clinical application.																	2041-4889					MAR 2	2020	11	3							158	10.1038/s41419-020-2357-8							WOS:000520938800005	32123161

Cancer cell plasticity has been proposed as being an important mechanism that, along with genetic and epigenetic alterations, promotes cancer cell diversity and contributes to intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity endows cancer cells with the capacity to shift dynamically between a differentiated state, with limited tumorigenic potential, and an undifferentiated or cancer stem-like cell (CSC) state, which is responsible for longterm tumor growth. In addition, it confers the ability to transit into distinct CSC states with different competence to invade, disseminate and seed metastasis. Cancer cell plasticity has been linked to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and relies not only on cell-autonomous mechanisms, but also on signals provided by the tumor microenvironment and/or induced in response to therapy. We provide an overview of the dynamic transition for cancer cell states, the mechanisms governing cell plasticity and their impact on tumor progression, metastasis and therapy response. Understanding the mechanisms involved in cancer cell plasticity will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic interventions.

Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Have a Heterogenic Cytokine Secretion Profile	STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												Mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (ASC) have immune regulatory function, which makes them interesting candidates for cellular therapy. ASC cultures are however heterogeneous in phenotype. It is unclear whether all ASC contribute equally to immunomodulatory processes. ASC are also responsive to cytokine stimulation, which may affect the ratio between more and less potent ASC populations. In the present study, we determined IL-6 receptor (CD126 and CD130 subunits) and IFN-gamma receptor (CD119) expression on ASC by flow cytometry. The production of IL-6 and IFN-gamma was measured by ELISA and the frequency of IL-6 and IFN-gamma secreting cells by ELISPOT. The results showed that ASC did not express CD126, and only 10-20% of ASC expressed CD130 on their surface, whereas 18-31% of ASC expressed CD119. ASC produced high levels of IL-6 and 100% of ASC were capable of secreting IL-6. Stimulation by IFN-gamma or TGF-beta had no effect on IL-6 secretion by ASC. IFN-gamma was produced by only 1.4% of ASC, and TGF-beta significantly increased the frequency to 2.7%. These results demonstrate that ASC cultures are heterogeneous in their cytokine secretion and receptor expression profiles. This knowledge can be employed for selection of potent, cytokine-producing, or responsive ASC subsets for cellular immunotherapy.					van Besouw, Nicole/0000-0003-4574-9288; Baan, Carla/0000-0003-2274-2788												1687-966X	1687-9678					2017	2017								4960831	10.1155/2017/4960831							WOS:000402429800001	28642794

The CIC state; however, is not hierarchically stable and conversion of non-CICs to CICs under microenvironment signals might represent a determinant of tumor aggressiveness. How plasticity is regulated at the cellular level is however poorly understood. To identify determinants of plasticity in lung cancer we exposed eight different cell lines to TGF beta 1 to induce EMT and stimulate modulation of CD133(+) CICs. We show that response to TGF beta 1 treatment is heterogeneous with some cells readily switching to stem cell state (1.5-2 fold CICs increase) and others being unresponsive to stimulation. This response is unrelated to original CICs content or extent of EMT engagement but is tightly dependent on balance between epithelial and mesenchymal features as measured by the ratio of expression of CDH1 (E-cadherin) to SNAI2. Epigenetic modulation of this balance can restore sensitivity of unresponsive models to microenvironmental stimuli, including those elicited by cancer-associated fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, tumors with increased prevalence of cells with features of partial EMT (hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype) are endowed with the highest plasticity and specific patterns of expression of SNAI2 and CDH1 markers identify a subset of tumors with worse prognosis. In conclusion, here we describe a connection between a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype and conversion to stem-cell state in response to external stimuli. These findings have implications for current endeavors to identify tumors with increased plasticity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this study, a particular focus was put on identifying a subpopulation of stem cell-like, slow cycling tumor cells in a pancreas adenocarcinoma cell lines. Using a label retention technique a subpopulation of slow cycling cells (DiI+/SCC) was identified and further evaluated in the BxPC-3 and Panc03.27 cell lines. These slowly cycling cells managed to retain the lipophilic labeling dye DiI, while the bulk of the cells (> 94%) did not. The DiI+/SCC population, showed only a partial overlap with the CSC markers CD24(+)/CD44(+), CD133(+) and ALDH but they survived chemotherapeutic treatment, and were able to recreate the initial heterogeneous tumor cell population. DiI+/SCCs exhibited an increased invasive potential as compared with their non-label retaining, faster cycling cells (DiI-/FCC). They also had increased tumorigenic potential and morphological changes resembling cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Analysis of DiI+/SCC cells by real time PCR revealed a selective up-regulation of tell tale components of the Hedgehog/TGF beta pathways, as well as a down-regulation of EGFR, combined with a shift in crucial components implied in EMT. The presented findings offer an expanded mechanistic understanding that associates tumor initiating potential with cycling speed and EMT in pancreatic cancer cell lines.

The functional differences in tumor progression between CAFs with mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs/MPCs) characteristics and CAFs without MSCs/MPCs characteristics are not clarified. CAFs and vascular adventitial fibroblasts (VAFs, which contain MSCs/MPCs) were isolated from nine primary lung cancers and were cultured in osteogenic or adipogenic medium to assess their multi-lineage differentiation. Next, we established nine single-cell-derived clones from the primary culture of CAFs and examined their differentiation potential. The effects of each single-cell-derived clone on the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549, were analyzed. The nine samples of VAFs and CAFs showed various degrees of osteogenic differentiation. Although the VAFs displayed the ability to undergo adipogenic differentiation, all cases of the CAFs did not. CAFs clones presented varying degrees of osteogenic differentiation. Four clones displayed comparable levels of osteogenic potential with that of the VAFs, and two clones were completely negative. As compared to the CAFs clones that possessed lower osteogenic potential, CAFs clones with higher osteogenic potential did not confer proliferative activity in A549 cells. On the contrary, these clones significantly promoted the migration of A549 cells as compared to the clones with lower osteogenic potential. Our studies clearly indicate that CAFs derived from lung cancer are heterogeneous population that consists of cells with varying osteogenic potentials and that CAFs with higher osteogenic potential have a greater tumor-promoting function through the enhancement of cancer cell migration.

However, it is unclear whether CSLC-derived spheroids are heterogeneous or whether they share common embryonic stemness properties. Understanding these features might lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Ovarian carcinoma is a deadly disease of women. We identified two types of spheroids (SR1 and SR2) from ovarian cancer cell lines and patients' specimens according to their morphology. Both types expressed stemness markers and could self-renew and initiate tumors when a low number of cells were used. Only SR1 could differentiate into multiple-lineage cell types under specific induction conditions. SR1 spheroids could differentiate to SR2 spheroids through epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was highly expressed in SR1 spheroids, decreased in SR2 spheroids, and was absent in differentiated progenies in accordance with the loss of stemness properties. We verified that ALP can be a marker for ovarian CSLCs, and patients with greater ALP expression is related to advanced clinical stages and have a higher risk of recurrence and lower survival rate. The ALP inhibitor, levamisole, disrupted the self-renewal of ovarian CSLCs in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In summary, this research provides a plastic ovarian cancer stem cell model and a new understanding of the cross-link between stem cells and cancers. This results show that ovarian CSLCs can be suppressed by levamisole. Our findings demonstrated that some ovarian CSLCs may restore ALP activity, and this suggests that inhibition of ALP activity may present a new opportunity for treatment of ovarian cancer.

However, there still have significant issues concerning the translational development of ADSC-based therapies, such as its heterogeneity and being prone to aging. We developed a new simple and economical 3D semi-suspended expansion method in which 3D spheroids reside on an ADSC-derived self-feeder cell layer, producing cells with increased population homogeneity and strong stemness and ensuring that the proliferation and differentiation potency of the cells does not become notably reduced after at least ten passages in culture. To check the potential application of the 3D ADSC spheroids, we discovered that the combination of siEID3, which is a small interfering RNA of EP300 inhibitor of differentiation 3 (EID3), and laminin/poly-d-lysine matrix can rapidly result in trans-differentiation of the 3D spheroid cells to neural progenitor-like cells (NPLCs) in approximately 9 days in vitro. This approach provides a multidisciplinary tool for stem cell research and production in mesenchymal stem cell-related fields.																		2073-4409				MAR	2021	10	3							493	10.3390/cells10030493							WOS:000633467700001	33668931

In search for shortcomings of iPSC chondrogenesis, this study investigated whether SOX9 protein was adequately regulated during multiphase chondrogenic differentiation of two human iPSC lines in a comparable manner like during mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) chondrogenesis. Upon generation of intermediate mesenchymal progenitor cells (iMPCs), SOX9 was induced and reached variable protein levels compared to MSCs. Along with an altered condensation behavior, iMPC cartilage formation was less robust compared to MSCs and better in the iMPC line with higher SOX9 protein levels. Despite efficient Smad-2/3 phosphorylation, TGF-beta-driven chondrogenic stimulation downregulated SOX9 protein in iMPCs rather than increasing levels like in MSCs. Chondrogenesis was further improved by cotreatment with TGF-beta + BMP-4, which appeared to shorten the duration of the SOX9 protein decline. However, this was insufficient to overcome heterogenic outcome and came at the expense of undesired hypertrophy. In iMPCs, but not MSCs, high levels of the SOX9-antagonizing hsa-miR-145 correlated with low SOX9 protein quantity. Thus, considerable iMPC heterogeneity with variable SOX9 protein levels, an altered condensation pattern, and low early SOX9 inducibility appeared as critical shortcomings of iPSC chondrogenesis. We suggest consistent quality of intermediate cell populations with high SOX9 protein induction as important indicators to obtain robust cartilage formation from iPSCs. The impact of this study is the identification of a SOX9 protein regulation opposite to MSC chondrogenesis that will now enable a selective adaptation of the currently limited protocols to the specific needs of iPSCs.

Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that efficient tumor treatment requires eradication of the entire CSC population. The potential role of CSCs in tumor initiation and relapse has motivated an investigation of the CSC-specific treatments. However, development of the therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs might be challenged by a high diversity and plasticity of CSC features. Moreover, taking in account that an origin of CSC remains controversial and accumulating experimental evidence suggests a possibility of tumor cell reprogramming, efficient anti-cancer treatment should eradicate both CSCs and tumor bulk as well as prevent tumor dedifferentiation. In this article we discuss new insights into the stem cell concept of tumor development, review the treatment strategies eradicating CSCs that have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies and summarize the strategies to identify new CSC-targeted therapy.

To further investigate the role of CSCs in tumor biology, there is a need to develop an effective culture system to grow, maintain and enrich CSCs. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model has been widely used in tumor research and drug screening. Recently, researchers have begun to utilize 3D models to culture cancer cells for CSCs enrichment. In this study, glioma cell line was cultured with 3D porous chitosan (CS) scaffolds or chitosan-hyaluronic acid (CS-HA) scaffolds to explore the possibility of glioma stem cells (GSCs)-like cells enrichment, to study the morphology, gene expression, and in vivo tumorigenicity of 3D scaffolds cells, and to compare results to 2D controls. Results showed that glioma cells on both CS and CS-HA scaffolds could form tumor cell spheroids and increased the expression of GSCs biomarkers compared to conventional 2D monolayers. Furthermore, cells in CS-HA scaffolds had higher expression levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene. Specifically, the in vivo tumorigenicity capability of CS-HA scaffold cultured cells was greater than 2D cells or CS scaffold cultured cells. It is indicated that the chemical composition of scaffold plays an important role in the enrichment of CSCs. Our results suggest that CS-HA scaffolds have a better capability to enrich GSCs-like cells and can serve as a simple and effective way to cultivate and enrich CSCs in vitro to support the study of CSCs biology and development of novel anti-cancer therapies.

However, the heterogeneity of this cell source may affect their ability in cartilage formation. It is therefore necessary to establish an efficient method for isolating the cells that have chondrogenic potential. To date, no specific markers have been reported to be able to isolate such a cell population from human adipose tissue. In recent studies, endoglin (CD105) has been known as a relatively specific marker for identifying mesenchymal stem cells, but no studies show it is related to chondrogenic potential of human ASCs. In this study, human cells from adipose tissue were isolated, cultured, and sorted according to CD105 expression. The sorted cells were then subjected to adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic induction to confirm their multi-potentiality. In adipogenic conditions, CD105 cells showed stronger Oil Red staining and higher expression of adipose-specific genes compared to CD105+ cells. By contrast, CD105+ cells exhibited better osteogenic potential with stronger Alizarin Red staining and higher expression of osteogenic specific genes than CD105 cells. Noticeably, CD105+ cells also exhibited a much stronger chondrogenic potential than CD105 cells, with stronger collagen II staining and higher gene expression of collagen II and aggrecan. Most importantly, CD105+ cells could form a homogeneous cartilage-like tissue when seeded into a biodegradable scaffold and cultured in chondrogenic media for 8 weeks. These results indicate that sorting of ASC subpopulation with CD105 as a marker may allow better in vitro chondrogenesis and thus provide an important implications for cartilage regeneration and reconstruction using autologous cells from adipose tissue.

Kinins in Glioblastoma Microenvironment	CANCER MICROENVIRONMENT												Tumour progression involves interactions among various cancer cell clones, including the cancer stem cell subpopulation and exogenous cellular components, termed cancer stromal cells. The latter include a plethora of tumour infiltrating immunocompetent cells, among which are also immuno-modulatory mesenchymal stem cells, which by vigorous migration to growing tumours and susequent transdifferentiation into various types of tumour-residing stromal cells, may either inhibit or support tumour progression. In the light of the scarce therapeutic options existing for the most malignant brain tumour glioblastoma, mesenchymal stem cells may represent a promising novel tool for cell therapy, e.g. drug delivery vectors. Here, we review the increasing number of reports on mutual interactions between mesenchymal stem cells and glioblastoma cells in their microenvironment. We particularly point out two novel aspects: the different responses of cancer cells to their microenvironmental cues, and to the signalling by kinin receptors that complement the immuno-modulating cytokine-signalling networks. Inflammatory glioblastoma microenvironment is characterised by increasing expression of kinin receptors during progressive glioma malignancy, thus making kinin signalling and kinins themselves rather important in this context. In general, their role in tumour microenvironment has not been explored so far. In addition, kinins also regulate blood brain barrier-related drug transfer as well as brain tumour angiogenesis. These studies support the on-going research on kinin antagonists as candidates in the development of anti-invasive agents for adjuvant glioblastoma therapy.

Process data of allogeneic ex vivo-expanded ABCB5(+) mesenchymal stromal cells for human use: off-the-shelf GMP-manufactured donor-independent ATMP	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Background Human dermal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) expressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter ABCB5 represent an easily accessible MSC population that, based on preclinical and first-in-human data, holds significant promise to treat a broad spectrum of conditions associated not only with skin-related but also systemic inflammatory and/or degenerative processes. Methods We have developed a validated Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant expansion and manufacturing process by which ABCB5(+) MSCs derived from surgical discard skin tissues are processed to an advanced-therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for clinical use. Enrichment for ABCB5(+) MSCs is achieved in a three-step process involving plastic adherence selection, expansion in a highly efficient MSC-selecting medium, and immunomagnetic isolation of the ABCB5(+) cells from the mixed culture. Results Product Quality Review data covering 324 cell expansions, 728 ABCB5(+) MSC isolations, 66 ABCB5(+) MSC batches, and 85 final drug products reveal high process robustness and reproducible, reliable quality of the manufactured cell therapy product. Conclusion We have successfully established an expansion and manufacturing process that enables the generation of homogenous ABCB5(+) MSC populations of proven biological activity manufactured as a standardized, donor-independent, highly pure, and highly functional off-the-shelf available ATMP, which is currently tested in multiple clinical trials.

Their therapeutic use requires extensive expansion to obtain a sufficiently high number of cells for clinical applications. State-of-the-art expansion systems, that is, primarily culture flask-based systems, are limited regarding scale-up, automation, and reproducibility. To overcome this bottleneck, microcarrier (MC)-based expansion processes have been developed. For the first time, MSCs from the perinatal sources umbilical cord (UC) and amniotic membrane (AM) were expanded on MCs. This study focuses on the comparison of flask-and Cytodex 1 MC-expanded MSCs by evaluating the influence of the expansion process on biological MSC characteristics. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis to obtain more homogeneous MSC preparations by expanding cells on MCs in controlled large-scale bioreactors. MSCs were extensively characterized determining morphology, cell growth, surface marker expression, and functional properties such as differentiation capacity, secretion of paracrine factors, and gene expression. Based on their gene expression profile MSCs from different donors and sources clearly clustered in distinct groups solely depending on the expansion process-MC or flask culture. MC-and flask-expanded MSCs significantly differed from each other regarding surface markers and both paracrine factors and gene expression profiles. Furthermore, based on gene expression analysis, MC cultivation of MSCs in controlled bioreactor systems resulted in less heterogeneity between cells from different donors. In conclusion, MC-based MSC expansion in controlled bioreactors has the potential to reliably produce MSCs with altered characteristics and functions as compared to flask-expanded MSCs. These findings may be useful for the generation of MSCs with tailored properties for clinical applications. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The heterogeneity, etiology, and origin of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma remain unknown. After obtaining the gene expression data of every cell in the tumor tissue by single-cell RNA sequencing, we used the Seurat package in R studio for quality control, analysis, and exploration of the data. All cells are divided into tumor cells and non-tumor cells, and we chose tumor cells by marker genes. Then, we repeated the process to cluster the tumor cells and divided the subgroups by their differentially expressed genes and gene ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Additionally, Monocle 2 was used for pseudo-time analysis to obtain the evolution trajectory of cells in tumor tissues. Tumor cells were divided into 5 subgroups according to their functions, which were characterized by high proliferation, sensing and adaptation to oxygen availability, enhanced epigenetic modification, enhanced nucleoside phosphonic acid metabolism, and ossification. Evolution trajectory of cells in tumor tissues is obtained. We used pseudo-time analysis to distinguish between mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts, proved that embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in the pelvic originated from skeletal muscle progenitor cells, showed the evolutionary trajectory of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and improved the method of evaluating the degree of malignancy of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.																	0025-7974	1536-5964				AUG 6	2021	100	31							e26775	10.1097/MD.0000000000026775							WOS:000680622300035	34397824

A topographical analysis	PLACENTA												Introduction: Human umbilical cord stem cells have inherent differentiation capabilities and potential usefulness in regenerative medicine. However, the epithelial differentiation capability and the heterogeneity of these cells have not been fully explored to the date. Methods: We analyzed the expression of several undifferentiation and epithelial markers in cells located in situ in different zones of the umbilical cord in situ analysis and in primary ex vivo cell cultures of Wharton's jelly stem cells by microarray and immunofluorescence. Results: Our results demonstrated that umbilical cord cells were heterogeneous and had intrinsic capability to express in situ stem cell markers, CD90 and CD105 and the epithelial markers cytokeratins 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 19, desmoplakin and zonula occludens 1 as determined by microarray and immunofluorescence, and most of these markers remained expressed after transferring the cells from the in situ to the ex vivo cell culture conditions. However, important differences were detected among some cell types in the umbilical cord, with subvascular zone cells showing less expression of stem cell markers and cells in Wharton's jelly and the amnioblastic zones showing the highest expression of stem cells and epithelial markers. Conclusions: These results suggest that umbilical cord mesenchymal cells have intrinsic potential to express relevant epithelial markers, and support the idea that they could be used as alternative cell sources for epithelial tissue engineering.

Strategies to Identify Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Minimally Manipulated Human Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate Lack Consensus	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE												Background: There is a need to identify and quantify mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in human bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) source tissues, but current methods to do so were established in cultured cell populations. Given that surface marker and gene expression change in cultured cells, it is doubtful that these strategies are valid to quantify MSCs in fresh BMAC. Purpose: To establish the presence, quantity, and heterogeneity of BMAC-derived MSCs in minimally manipulated BMAC using currently available strategies. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Five published strategies to identify MSCs were compared for suitability and efficiency to quantify clinical-grade BMAC-MSCs and cultured MSCs at the single cell transcriptome level on BMAC samples being used clinically from 15 orthopaedic patients and on 1 cultured MSC sample. Strategies included (1) the guidelines by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), (2) CD271 expression, (3) the Ghazanfari et al transcriptional profile, (4) the Jia et al transcriptional profile, and (5) the Silva et al transcriptional profile. Results: ISCT guidelines did not identify any MSCs in BMAC at the transcriptional level and only 1 in 9 million cells at the protein level. Of 12,850 BMAC cells, 9 expressed the CD271 gene. Only 116 of 396 Ghazanfari genes were detected in BMAC, whereas no cells expressed all of them. No cells expressed all Jia genes, but 25 cells expressed at least 13 of 22. No cells expressed all Silva genes, but 19 cells expressed at least 8 of 23. Most importantly, the liberalized strategies tended to identify different cells and most of them clustered with immune cells. Conclusion: Currently available methods need to be liberalized to identify any MSCs in fresh human BMAC and lack consensus at the single cell transcriptome and protein expression levels. These different cells should be isolated and challenged to establish phenotypic differences.

Cell-mechanics-based microfluidic sorting systems provide efficient and specific platforms for investigation of stem cell-like characteristics on the basis of cell deformability and cell-substrate adhesion properties. In the present study, a microfluidic tandem mechanical sorting system is developed to enrich CSCs with high flexibility and low adhesive capacity. In the integrated microfluidic system, cancer cells are driven by hydrodynamic forces to flow continuously through two featured devices, which are functionalized with sequentially variable microbarriers and surface-coated fluid mixing microchannels, respectively. Collected deformable and low-adhesive cancer cells exhibit enhanced stem cell-like properties with higher stemness and metastasis capacity both in vitro and in vivo, compared with each single device separation. Using these devices, bioactive natural compound screening targeting CSCs is performed and a potent therapeutic compound isoliquiritigenin from licorice is identified to inhibit the lung cancer stem cell phenotype. Taken together, this microfluidic tandem mechanical sorting system can facilitate drug screening targeting CSCs and the analysis of signals regulating CSC function in drug resistance.																	2192-2640	2192-2659				OCT	2021	10	20							2100985	10.1002/adhm.202100985		SEP 2021					WOS:000692617500001	34486235

The major molecular subtypes of PDAC are designated classical/epithelial (E) and quasi-mesenchymal (QM) subtypes, with the latter having the worst prognosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), are involved in regulating invasion/metastasis and stem cell generation in cancer cells but also early pancreatic endocrine differentiation or de-differentiation of adult pancreatic islet cells in vitro, suggesting that pancreatic ductal exocrine and endocrine cells share common EMT programs. Using a panel of PDAC-derived cell lines classified by epithelial/mesenchymal expression as either E or QM, we compared their trans-differentiation (TD) potential to endocrine progenitor or beta cell-like cells since studies with human pancreatic cancer cells for possible future TD therapy in PDAC patients are not available so far. We observed that QM cell lines responded strongly to TD culture using as inducers 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or growth factors/cytokines, while their E counterparts were refractory or showed only a weak response. Moreover, the gain of plasticity was associated with a decrease in proliferative and migratory activities and was directly related to epigenetic changes acquired during selection of a metastatic phenotype as revealed by TD experiments using the paired isogenic COLO 357-L3.6pl model. Our data indicate that a QM phenotype in PDAC coincides with increased plasticity and heightened trans-differentiation potential to activate a pancreatic beta cell-specific transcriptional program. We strongly assume that this specific biological feature has potential to be exploited clinically in TD-based therapy to convert metastatic PDAC cells into less malignant or even benign cells.

Here, we have identified Tenascin C (TNC) to be upregulated and secreted in mesenchymal glioblastoma (MES GBM) subtype with high NF-kappa B signaling activity. Silencing TNC decreases proliferation, migration and suppresses self-renewal of glioma stem cells. Loss of TNC in MES GBM compromises de-differentiation of transformed astrocytes and blocks the ability of glioma stem cells to differentiate into tumor derived endothelial cells (TDEC). Inhibition of NF-kappa B activity or TNC knockdown in tumor cells decreased their tumorigenic potential in vivo. Our results uncover a link between NF-kappa B activation in MES GBM and high levels of TNC in GBM extracellular matrix. We suggest that TNC plays an important role in the autocrine regulation of glioma cell plasticity and hence can be a potential molecular target for MES GBM.

The GBM resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs may be due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The CSCs activate the same molecular pathways as healthy stem cells such as WNT, Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Notch. Mutations or deregulations of those pathways play a key role in the proliferation and differentiation of their surrounding environment, leading to tumorigenesis. Here we investigated the effect of SHH signaling pathway inhibition in human GBM cells by using GANT-61, considering stem cell phenotype, cell proliferation, and cell death. Our results demonstrated that GANT-61 induces apoptosis and autophagy in GBM cells, by increasing the expression of LC3 II and cleaved caspase 3 and 9. Moreover, we observed that SHH signaling plays a crucial role in CSC phenotype maintenance, being also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. We also noted that SHH pathway modulation can regulate cell proliferation as revealed through the analysis of Ki-67 and c-MYC expressions. We concluded that SHH signaling pathway inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach to treat patients suffering from GBM refractory to traditional treatments.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to investigate the regulatory mechanisms for different GBM subsets and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets relevant in the context of GBM-specific niches. The DHHC family of proteins is associated tightly with the malignant development and progression of gliomas. However, the role of these proteins in the plasticity of GBM subsets remains unclear.MethodsThis study utilized human glioma proneural or mesenchymal stem cells as indicated. The effects of DHHC proteins on different GBM subsets were investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays (i.e., colony formation assay, flow cytometry assay, double immunofluorescence, western blot, and xenograft model). Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer-mass spectrometry assays were used to detect the protein complexes of ZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 in various GBM subtypes, and explore the mechanism of DHHC proteins in targeting different subsets of GSCs in specific niches.ResultsZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 could target the glioma stem cells of different GBM subsets in the context of their specific niches and regulate the cellular plasticity of these subtypes. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that ZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 competitively interact with a BMI1 E3 ligase, RNF144A, to regulate the polyubiquitination and accumulation of BMI1. These events contributed to the transition of glioma stem cells in GBM and cell survival under the stressful tumor microenvironment.ConclusionsOur work highlights the role of DHHC proteins in the plasticity of GBM subsets and reveals that BMI1 represents a potential therapeutic target for human gliomas.

However, the impact of different isolation procedures on the functional and regenerative characteristics of MSC populations has not been studied thoroughly. To quantify these differences, we directly compared classically isolated bulk bone marrow-derived MSCs (bulk BM-MSCs) to the subpopulation Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD45(-)-derived MSCs- (SL45-MSCs), isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from bulk BM-cell suspensions. Both populations were analyzed with respect to functional readouts, that are, frequency of fibroblast colony forming units (CFU-f), general morphology, and expression of stem cell markers. The SL45-MSC population is characterized by greater morphological homogeneity, higher CFU-f frequency, and significantly increased nestin expression compared with bulk BM-MSCs. We further quantified the potential of both cell populations to enhance neuronal fiber growth, using an ex vivo model of organotypic brain slice co-cultures of the mesocortical dopaminergic projection system. The MSC populations were cultivated underneath the slice co-cultures without direct contact using a transwell system. After cultivation, the fiber density in the border region between the two brain slices was quantified. While both populations significantly enhanced fiber outgrowth as compared with controls, purified SL45-MSCs stimulated fiber growth to a larger degree. Subsequently, we analyzed the expression of different growth factors in both cell populations. The results show a significantly higher expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor in the SL45-MSCs population. Altogether, we conclude that MSC preparations enriched for primary MSCs promote neuronal regeneration and axonal regrowth, more effectively than bulk BM-MSCs, an effect that may be mediated by a higher BDNF secretion.

MicroRNA regulation of stem cell differentiation and diseases of the bone and adipose tissue: Perspectives on miRNA biogenesis and cellular transcriptome	BIOCHIMIE												MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through targeting and suppression of mRNAs. miRNAs have been under investigation for the past twenty years and there is a large breadth of information on miRNAs in diseases such as cancer and immunology. Only more recently have miRNAs shown promise as a mechanism for intervention with respect to diseases of the bone and adipose tissue. In mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation, alterations in miRNA expression patterns can differentially promote an osteogenic, adipogenic, or myogenic phenotype. This manuscript reviews the current literature with respect to miRNAs in the context of MSC function with a particular focus on novel avenues for the examination of miRNA associated with bone and adipose tissue biology and disease. Specifically we highlight the need for a greater depth of investigation on MSCs with respect to miRNA biogenesis, processing, strand selection, and heterogeneity. We discuss how these mechanisms facilitate both altered miRNA expression and function. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies mostly used limited cell markers and failed to identify cells negative for these markers. Therefore, the cell composition and origin of ADPKD cyst are still unclear, and mechanisms of cystogenesis of different origins await further exploration. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing for the normal kidney tissue and seven cysts derived from superficial or deep layers of the polycystic kidney from an ADPKD patient. Results: Twelve cell types were identified and analyzed. We found that a renal cyst could be derived either from CD or both PT and LOH. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed that epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNFA signaling via the NFKB pathways, and xenobiotic metabolism were significantly activated in PT-derived cyst epithelial cells while robust expression of genes involved in G2M Checkpoint, mTORC1 signaling, E2F Targets, MYC Targets V1, MYC Targets V2 were observed in CD-derived cells. Conclusion: Our results revealed that a single cyst could originate from CD or both PT and LOH, suggesting heterogeneity of polycystic composition and origin. Furthermore, cyst epithelial cells with different origins have different gene set activation.																	1838-7640						2021	11	20					10064	10073		10.7150/thno.57220							WOS:000719124500008	34815804

Because of their immunosuppressive properties, MSCs are commonly used as an allogeneic treatment. However, for the many donors who could potentially be used, it is important to understand the capacity for therapeutic usage with donor-to-donor heterogeneity. In this study, we aimed to investigate MSCs as a promising therapeutic strategy for critical limb ischemia. We evaluated MSCs from two donors (#55 and #64) and analyzed the capacity for angiogenesis through in vivo and in vitro assays to compare the therapeutic effect between different donors. We emphasized the importance of intra-population heterogeneity of MSCs on therapeutic usage by evaluating the effects of hypoxia on activating cellular angiogenesis in MSCs. The precondition of hypoxia in MSCs is known to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Our study suggests that sensitivity to hypoxic conditions is different between cells originating from different donors, and this difference affects the contribution to angiogenesis. The bioinformatics analysis of different donors under hypoxic culture conditions identified intrinsic variability in gene expression patterns and suggests alternative potential genetic factors ANGPTL4, ADM, SLC2A3, and CDON as guaranteed general indicators for further stem cell therapy.

A Novel Invadopodia-Specific Marker for Invasive and Pro-Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells	FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY												Introduction Stem-like cancer cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) may comprise a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous subset of cells, whereas the molecular markers reflecting this CSC hierarchy remain elusive. The glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1) present on the surface of malignant tumor cells has been identified as a metastasis-promoting factor through its function of activating plasminogen. The expression pattern of surface ENO1 (sENO1) concerning cell-to-cell or CSC heterogeneity and its functional roles await further investigation. Methods The cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity of sENO1 was profiled in malignant cells from different types of cancers using flow cytometry. The subcellular localization of sENO1 and its functional roles in the invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasiveness were investigated using a series of imaging, molecular, and in vitro and in vivo functional studies. Results We showed here that ENO1 is specifically localized to the invadopodial surface of a significant subset (11.1%-63.9%) of CSCs in human gastric and prostate adenocarcinomas. sENO1(+) CSCs have stronger mesenchymal properties than their sENO1(-) counterparts. The subsequent functional studies confirmed the remarkable pro-invasive and pro-metastatic capacities of sENO1(+) CSCs. Mechanistically, inhibiting the surface localization of ENO1 by downregulating caveolin-1 expression compromised invadopodia biogenesis, proteolysis, and CSC invasiveness. Conclusions Our study identified the specific expression of ENO1 on the invadopodial surface of a subset of highly invasive and pro-metastatic CSCs. sENO1 may provide a diagnostically and/or therapeutically exploitable target to improve the outcome of patients with aggressive and metastatic cancers.

Omental adipose-derived stromal cells (O-ASCs) are similar to MSCs, which could be recruited to the stroma in endometrial cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate whether O-ASCs can fuse with endometrial cancer cells to influence cancer cells biological characteristics. We isolated O-ASCs from patients with endometrial cancer. O-ASCs and endometrial cancer cells were labeled with different fluorescent tags and directly co-cultured in an Opera high-throughput spinning-disk confocal microscopy system to observe the processes involved in the fusion, division and migration of hybrid cells. Immunofluorescence and high-throughput imaging analyzes were performed to evaluate proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).We found O-ASCs could spontaneously fuse with endometrial cancer cells, including cytomembrane and nuclear fusion. After fusion, endometrial cancer cells assume an elongated and fibroblast-like appearance that exhibit mesenchymal phenotypes. The hybrid cells proliferated through bipolar and multipolar divisions and exhibited more rapid migratory speeds than were observed in the parental cells (P < 0.01), potentially because of their EMT-associated changes, including the down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of Vimentin. Our results collectively suggest that tumorigenic hybrids spontaneously formed between human O-ASCs and endometrial cancer cells, and that the resulting cells enhanced cancer mobility and heterogeneity by accelerated migration and undergoing multipolar divisions. These data provide a new avenue for investigating the roles of O-ASCs in endometrial cancer.																	1538-4101	1551-4005				FEB 1	2019	18	3					320	332		10.1080/15384101.2019.1568743							WOS:000458402300008	30636489

Cancer cells exhibit clonal diversity in phenotypic plasticity	OPEN BIOLOGY												Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancers is associated with invasive progression and drug resistance. This heterogeneity arises in part from the ability of cancer cells to switch between phenotypic states, but the dynamics of this cellular plasticity remain poorly understood. Here we apply DNA barcodes to quantify and track phenotypic plasticity across hundreds of clones in a population of cancer cells exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation phenotypes. We find that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell ratio is highly variable across the different clones in cancer cell populations, but remains stable for many generations within the progeny of any single clone-with a heritability of 0.89. To estimate the effects of combination therapies on phenotypically heterogeneous tumours, we generated quantitative simulations incorporating empirical data from our barcoding experiments. These analyses indicated that combination therapies which alternate between epithelial-and mesenchymal-specific treatments eventually select for clones with increased phenotypic plasticity. However, this selection could be minimized by increasing the frequency of alternation between treatments, identifying designs that may minimize selection for increased phenotypic plasticity. These findings establish new insights into phenotypic plasticity in cancer, and suggest design principles for optimizing the effectiveness of combination therapies for phenotypically heterogeneous tumours.

Morphological features of IFN-gamma-stimulated mesenchymal stromal cells predict overall immunosuppressive capacity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Human mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) lines can vary significantly in their functional characteristics, and the effectiveness of MSC-based therapeutics may be realized by finding predictive features associated with MSC function. To identify features associated with immunosuppressive capacity in MSCs, we developed a robust in vitro assay that uses principal-component analysis to integrate multidimensional flow cytometry data into a single measurement of MSC-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation. We used this assay to correlate single-cell morphological data with overall immunosuppressive capacity in a cohort of MSC lines derived from different donors and manufacturing conditions. MSC morphology after IFN-gamma stimulation significantly correlated with immunosuppressive capacity and accurately predicted the immunosuppressive capacity of MSC lines in a validation cohort. IFN-gamma enhanced the immunosuppressive capacity of all MSC lines, and morphology predicted the magnitude of IFN-gamma-enhanced immunosuppressive activity. Together, these data identify MSC morphology as a predictive feature of MSC immunosuppressive function.

ECs demonstrate functional and phenotypic heterogeneity when located under different microenvironments. Here, we describe a tumor-stimulated mesenchymal phenotype in ECs and investigate its impact on tumor growth, stemness, and invasiveness. Methods: Xenograft tumor assay in NOD/SCID mice and confocal imaging were conducted to show the acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype in tumor-associated ECs in vivo. Immunocytochemistry, qPCR and flow cytometry techniques showed the appearance of mesenchymal traits in ECs after contact with breast tumor cell lines MDA-MB231 or MCF-7. Cell proliferation, cell migration, and sphere formation assays were applied to display the functional advantages of mesenchymal ECs in tumor growth, invasiveness, and enrichment of tumor initiating cells. qPCR and western blotting were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying EC mesenchymal transition. Results: Our results showed that co-injection of ECs and tumor cells in NOD/SCID mice significantly enhanced tumor growth in vivo with tumor-associated ECs expressing mesenchymal markers while maintaining their intrinsic endothelial trait. We also showed that a mesenchymal phenotype is possibly detectable in human neoplastic breast biopsies as well as ECs pre-exposed to tumor cells (ECsMes) in vitro. The ECsMes acquired prolonged survival, increased migratory behavior and enhanced angiogenic properties. In return, ECsMes were capable of enhancing tumor survival and invasiveness. The mesenchymal phenotypes in ECsMes were the result of a contact-dependent transient phenomenon and reversed upon removal of the neoplastic contexture. We showed a synergistic role for TGF beta and notch pathways in this phenotypic change, as simultaneous inhibition of notch and TGF beta down-regulated Smad1/5 phosphorylation and Jag1(KD) tumor cells were unable to initiate the process. Conclusions: Overall, our data proposed a crosstalk mechanism between tumor and microenvironment where tumor-stimulated mesenchymal modulation of ECs enhanced the constitution of a transient mesenchymal/endothelial niche leading to significant increase in tumor proliferation, stemness, and invasiveness. The possible involvement of notch and TGF beta pathways in the initiation of mesenchymal phenotype may propose new stromal targets.

A novel hypoxia-associated subset of FN1(high)MITF(low) melanoma cells: identification, characterization, and prognostic value	MODERN PATHOLOGY												In many human cancers, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition has an important role in the induction of cancer stem-like cells, and hence, in the causation of intratumoral heterogeneity. This process, also referred to as mesenchymal mimicry, is, however, only poorly understood in melanoma and histological correlation is still lacking. In an immunohistochemical analysis of a large prospective series of 220 primary and metastatic melanomas for the well-known epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition marker FN1, we observed melanoma cells with high FN1 expression in metastases with ischemic necrosis, but rarely or not at all in samples lacking evidence of hypoxia. In a blinded, retrospective series of 82 melanoma metastases with 10-year follow-up, the presence of clusters of these FN1(high) melanoma cells correlated significantly with shortened melanoma-specific survival, highlighting the prognostic value of their presence. We describe in detail the unique light- and electron-microscopic features of these FN1(high) melanoma cells, enabling their identification in routinely hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. In addition, by laser microdissection and subsequent gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry, we highlight their distinctive, molecular phenotype that includes expression of various markers of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (eg, ZEB1) and of melanoma stem-like cells (eg, NGFR), and lack of immunoreactivity for the melanocytic marker MITF. This phenotype could be reproduced in vitro by culturing melanoma cells under hypoxic conditions. Functionally, the hypoxic microenvironment was shown to induce a more migratory and invasive cell type. In conclusion, we identified a novel clinically relevant FN1(high)MITF(low) cell type in melanoma associated with ischemic necrosis, and propose that these cells reside at the crossroad of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem-like cell induction, plausibly triggered by the hypoxic environment.

Recent evidence suggests potential roles of LMP1 and LMP2A in Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in NPC. EMT engages in the generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and confers on cancer cells increased tumor-initiating and metastatic potential, and higher resistance to anticancer therapies. However, how LMP1 and LMP2A regulate the EMT process to generate cells with different EMT states and its implications for tumor progression remain unclear. Here we report that LMP1 and LMP2A promote EMT that drives NPC cells from the epithelial-like state (CD104(+), CD44(low)) to epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid (E/M) state (CD104(+), CD44(high)). Furthermore, LMP2A possesses an additional function in stabilizing LMP1 and increasing the level of LMP1 in NPC cells. The elevated LMP1 further forces the EMT to generate extreme-mesenchymal (xM) state cells (CD104(-), CD44(high)). To define the tumorigenic features of cancer stem cells at different states in the EMT spectrum, E, E/M and xM subpopulations were isolated and tested for tumorigenic capability in a tumor xenograft animal model. We found that the cells with E/M phenotypes possess the highest tumor initiating capacity. However, the xM subpopulation exhibits increased vasculogenic mimicry, a hallmark of metastatic cancers. Taken together, coordinated action of LMP1 and LMP2A generates an array of intermediate subpopulations in the EMT spectrum that are responsible for distinct tumorigenic features of NPC such as tumor-initiation, vasculogenesis, and metastasis. Author summary Intratumoral heterogeneity, characterized by the existence of distinct cellular populations within tumor lesions, poses a significant challenge for the treatment of high-grade cancers. Using an EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) model, we sought to elucidate how a virus or its oncoproteins promote the establishment of cancer stem cells that comprises heterogeneous subpopulations. We found that the coordinated action of EBV membrane proteins LMP1 and LMP2A generates heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer stem cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by activating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, the contributions of the different subpopulations to NPC oncogenesis were investigated. Results showed that cells with an epithelial/mesenchymal hybrid state (E/M) possess the highest tumor initiating capacity; and a highly mesenchymal state (xM) subpopulation exhibits increased vasculogenic mimicry. These finding suggest that cancer stem cells residing at various EMT states are responsible for distinct tumorigenic features such as tumor-initiation, vasculogenesis, and metastasis.

Tumor formation, progression, recurrence, and chemo-resistance are associated with the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) that show phenotypic heterogeneity, but how they influence tumor behavior remains poorly understood. We aimed to describe how two CSC phenotypes from an OSCC cell line, CD44(High)ESA(High)(Epi-CSC) and CD44(High)ESA(Low)(EMT-CSC), behave in vitro and in vivo. Methods In vitro behavior of FACS-sorted Epi-CSC and EMT-CSC from OSCC cells was characterized by their ability to form colonies, migrate, proliferate, and to invade a solid matrix. In vivo experiments were conducted in immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice by orthotopic xenografting of FACS-sorted OSCC subpopulations. Results In vitro, the Epi-CSC phenotype was more proliferative and generated more holoclones than the EMT phenotype. On the other hand, EMT-CSC migrate and invaded more than Epi-CSC cells in 3D culture, suggesting the CSC phenotype affects tumor cell behavior. When inoculated orthotopically into the tongues of immunodeficient mice, both subpopulations generated OSCC, but EMT-CSC formed fewer and smaller tumors. Conclusions Our results suggest that while cells in the Epi-CSC form the subpopulation that enables tumor growth, the EMT-CSC are related to migration and invasion. Clinically, this may reflect the importance of Epi-CSC for tumorigenesis and of the EMT-CSC for metastasis and highlights that variation in the proportion of CSC phenotypes from patient to patient may be relevant to the design of individual treatment protocols.

Contextual cues from cancer cells govern cancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity	CELL REPORTS												Cancer cells function as primary architects of the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular features of cancer cells that govern stromal cell phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we show that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) heterogeneity is driven by lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells at either end of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) spectrum. LUAD cells that have high expression of the EMT-activating transcription factor ZEB1 reprogram CAFs through a ZEB1-dependent secretory program and direct CAFs to the tips of invasive projections through a ZEB1-driven CAF repulsion process. The EMT, in turn, sensitizes LUAD cells to pro-metastatic signals from CAFs. Thus, CAFs respond to contextual cues from LUAD cells to promote metastasis.

In recent years, studies have demonstrated different phenotypes among BCSCs. Furthermore, BCSCs of diverse phenotypes are present at different tumour sites and different histological stages. Fibroblasts are involved in the phenotypic transformation of BCSCs. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) participate in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby promoting the acquisition of stem cell characteristics, but little is known about the role of normal fibroblasts (NFs) in the phenotypic transformation of BCSCs or about the effect of CAFs and NFs on BCSC phenotypes. Methods: A total of six pairs of primary CAFs and NFs were isolated from surgical samples of breast cancer patients and subjected to morphological, immunohistochemical, cell invasion and proteomics analyses. After establishing a cell culture system with conditioned medium from CAFs and NFs, we used the mammosphere formation assay to explore the effect of CAFs and NFs on the self-renewal ability of BCSCs. The effect of CAFs and NFs on the phenotypic differentiation of BCSCs was further analysed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: The isolated CAFs and NFs did not show significant differences in cell morphology or alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, but cell invasion and proteomics analyses demonstrated heterogeneity among these fibroblasts. Both CAFs and NFs could promote the generation of BCSCs, but CAFs displayed a greater ability than NFs in promoting mammosphere formation. Conditioned medium from CAFs increased the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 positive (ALDH1(+)) BCSCs, but conditioned medium from NFs was more likely to promote the generation of CD44(+)CD24(-) BCSCs from MCF-7 cells. Discussion: This study validated the heterogeneity among CAFs and NFs and expanded on the conclusion that fibroblasts promote the generation of cancer stem cells. Our results particularly emphasized the effect of NFs on the phenotypic transformation of BCSCs. In addition, this study further highlighted the roles of CAFs and NFs in the induction of different phenotypes in BCSCs.																	2167-8359					MAY 15	2018	6								e4805	10.7717/peerj.4805							WOS:000432628600007	29780673

Patient survival is poor. Aggressive tumors contain populations of rapidly proliferating clonogens that exhibit stem cell properties, cancer stem cells (CSCs). Conceptually, CSCs that evade intensive multimodal therapy dictate tumor progression, relapse/recurrence, and poor clinical outcomes. Herein, we investigated the plasticity and stem-cell related molecular response of aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma cells that fit the CSC model. Methods: Well-characterized clones of metastatic site-derived aggressive cells (MSDACs) from a manifold of metastatic tumors of clinically translatable HR-NB were characterized for their CSC fit by examining epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (E-cadherin, N-Cadherin), survival (NF kappa B P65, p50, I kappa B and pI kappa B) and drug resistance (ABCG2) by immunoblotting; pluripotency maintenance (Nanog, SOX2) by immunofluorescence; and EMT and stemness related transcription of 93 genes by QPCR profiling. Plasticity of MSDACs under sequential alternation of culture conditions with serum and serum-free stem-cell conditions was assessed by clonal expansion (BrdU incorporation), tumorosphere formation (anchorage independent growth), EMT and stemness related transcriptome (QPCR profiling) and validated with MYC, SOX2, EGFR, NOTCH1 and CXCL2 immunoblotting. Results: HR-NB MSDACs maintained in alternated culture conditions, serum-free stem cell medium to growth medium with serum and vice versa identified its flexible revocable plasticity characteristics. We observed signatures of stem cell-related molecular responses consistent with phenotypic conversions. Successive reintroduction to the favorable niche not only regained identical EMT, self-renewal capacity, pluripotency maintenance, and other stem cell-related signaling events, but also instigated additional events depicting aggressive adaptive plasticity. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrated the flexible plasticity of HR-NB MSDACs that typically fit the CSC model, and further identified the intrinsic adaptiveness of the successive phenotype switching that clarifies the heterogeneity of HR-NB. Moreover, the continuous ongoing acquisition of stem cell-related molecular rearrangements may hold the key to the switch from favorable disease to HR-NB.

However, little is known about the dynamics of ITH, owing to the lack of time-series analysis at the single-cell level. Mouse models that recapitulate cancer development are useful for controlled serial time sampling. Results We performed single-cell exome and transcriptome sequencing of 200 cells to investigate how ITH is generated in a mouse colorectal cancer model. In the model, a single normal intestinal cell is grown into organoids that mimic the intestinal crypt structure. Upon RNAi-mediated downregulation of a tumor suppressor gene APC, the transduced organoids were serially transplanted into mice to allow exposure to in vivo microenvironments, which play relevant roles in cancer development. The ITH of the transcriptome increased after the transplantation, while that of the exome decreased. Mutations generated during organoid culture did not greatly change at the bulk-cell level upon the transplantation. The RNA ITH increase was due to the emergence of new transcriptional subpopulations. In contrast to the initial cells expressing mesenchymal-marker genes, new subpopulations repressed these genes after the transplantation. Analyses of colorectal cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed a high proportion of metastatic cases in human subjects with expression patterns similar to the new cell subpopulations in mouse. These results suggest that the birth of transcriptional subpopulations may be a key for adaptation to drastic micro-environmental changes when cancer cells have sufficient genetic alterations at later tumor stages. Conclusions This study revealed an evolutionary dynamics of single-cell RNA and DNA heterogeneity in tumor progression, giving insights into the mesenchymal-epithelial transformation of tumor cells at metastasis in colorectal cancer.																		1741-7007				SEP 21	2021	19	1							207	10.1186/s12915-021-01147-5							WOS:000698424700002	34548081

Molecular profile of clonal strains of human skeletal stem/progenitor cells with different potencies	STEM CELL RESEARCH												Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) are fibroblastic reticular cells, a subset of which is composed of multipotent skeletal stem cells (SSCs). SSCs/BMSCs are able to recreate a bone/marrow organ in vivo. To determine differences between clonogenic multipotent SSCs and similarly clonogenic but non-multipotent BMSCs, we established single colony-derived strains (SCDSs, initiated by individual Colony Forming Unit-Fibroblasts) and determined their differentiation capacity by vivo transplantation. In this series of human SCDSs (N = 24), 20.8% formed fibrous tissue (F), 66.7% formed bone (B), and 12.5% formed a bone/marrow organ, and thus were multipotent (M). RNA isolated from 12 SCDSs just prior to transplantation was analyzed by microarray. Although highly similar, there was variability from one SCDS to another, and SCDSs did not strictly segregate into the three functional groups (F, B or M) by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. We then compared 3 F-SCDSs to 3 M-SCDSs that did segregate. Genes associated with skeletogenesis, osteoblastogeneis, hematopoiesis, and extracellular matrix were over-represented in M-SCDSs compared with F-SCDSs. These results highlight the heterogeneity of SSCs/BMSCs, even between functionally similar SCDSs, but also indicate that differences can be detected that may shed light on the character of the SSC.

They share properties similar to the bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the amount of MSCs per gram of fat tissue is 500x higher. The fat tissue can easily be digested by collagenase, releasing a heterogeneous cell fraction called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) which contains a variable amount of stromal/stem cells. In Europe, cell products like the SVF derived from fat tissue are considered advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMPs). As a consequence, the manufacturing process has to be approved via GMP-compliant process validation. The problem of the process validation for SVF is the heterogeneity of this fraction. Methods: Here, we modified existing purification strategies by adding an additional plastic adherence incubation of maximal 20 hours after SVF isolation. The resulting cell fraction was characterized and compared to SVF as well as cultivated adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) with respect to viability and cell yield, the expression of surface markers, differentiation potential and cytokine expression. Results: Short-term incubation significantly reduced the heterogeneity degrees lithe resulting cell fraction compared to SVF. The cells were able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocres, and osteoblasts. More importantly, they expressed trophic proteins which have been previously associated with the beneficial effects of MSCs. Furthermore, GMP compliance of the production process described herein was acknowledged by the national regulatory agencies (DE_ BB_01_GMR_2017_1018). Conclusion: Addition of a short purification-step after the SVF isolation is a cheap and fast strategy to isolate a homogeneous uncultivated GMP-compliant cell fraction of ASCs.

The curative approach for highly selected patients is the pancreas or the pancreatic islet transplantation. Nevertheless, these options are limited by a growing shortage of donor organs and by the requirement of immunosuppression. Xenotransplantation of porcine islets has been extensively investigated. Nevertheless, the strong xenoimmunity and the risk of transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses, have limited their application in clinic. Generation of beta-like cells from stem cells is one of the most promising strategies in regenerative medicine. Embryonic, and more recently, adult stem cells are currently the most promising cell sources exploited to generate functional beta-cells in vitro. A number of studies demonstrated that stem cells could generate functional pancreatic organoids (POs), able to restore normoglycemia when implanted in different preclinical diabetic models. Nevertheless, a gradual loss of function and cell dead are commonly detected when POs are transplanted in immunocompetent animals. So far, the main issue to be solved is the post-transplanted islet loss, due to the host immune attack. To avoid this hurdle, nanotechnology has provided a number of polymers currently under investigation for islet micro and macro-encapsulation. These new approaches, besides conferring PO immune protection, are able to supply oxygen and nutrients and to preserve PO morphology and long-term viability. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge on bioengineered POs and the stem cell differentiation platforms. We also discuss the in vitro strategies used to generate functional POs, and the protocols currently used to confer immune-protection against the host immune attack (micro- and macro-encapsulation). In addition, the most relevant ongoing clinical trials, and the most relevant hurdles met to move towards clinical application are revised.

In addition, such analyses may reveal new knowledge about the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance and tumour progression in patients with cancer. Methods: Single circulating tumour cells were isolated from patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer with immuno-magnetic depletion and immuno-fluorescence microscopy. mRNA expression was analysed with single-cell multiplex RT-qPCR. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were performed to identify expression patterns. Results: Circulating tumour cells were detected in 33 of 56 (59%) examined blood samples. Single-cell mRNA profiling of intact isolated circulating tumour cells revealed both epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like subpopulations, which were distinct from leucocytes. The profiled circulating tumour cells also expressed elevated levels of stem cell markers, and the extracellular matrix protein, SPARC. The expression of SPARC might correspond to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic circulating tumour cells. Conclusion: The analysis of single pancreatic circulating tumour cells identified distinct subpopulations and revealed elevated expression of transcripts relevant to the dissemination of circulating tumour cells to distant organ sites.

Heterogeneity of chemokine cell-surface receptor expression in triple-negative breast cancer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH												Introduction: Tumor heterogeneity is a well-established concept in cancer research. In this paper, we examine an additional type of tumor cell heterogeneity - tumor cell-surface receptor heterogeneity. Methods: We use flow cytometry to measure the frequency and numbers of cell-surface receptors on triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Results: We find two distinct populations of human triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 when they are grown in culture, one with low surface levels of various chemokine receptors and a second with much higher levels. The population with high surface levels of these receptors is increased in the more metastatic MDA-MB-231-luc-d3h2ln cell line. Conclusion: We hypothesize that this high cell-surface receptor population is involved in metastasis. We find that the receptor high populations can be modulated by tumor conditioned media and IL6 treatment indicating that the tumor microenvironment is important for the maintenance and sizes of these populations.

In this study, we compared the effect of MSCs cultured in different oxygen concentrations on GVHD in mice to elucidate whether hypoxia improves the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs. Hypoxia increased the proliferative activity and the expression of several stemness and chemokine genes, such as KLF4, OCT4, C-MYC, CCL2, and CXCL10. Mice that received MSCs cultured in normoxia or hypoxia showed alleviated symptoms of GVHD and increased survival times. However, there was no significant difference in survival rates between mice that received MSCs cultured in normoxia and hypoxia. These data suggest that hypoxic culture is a useful method for maintaining and obtaining MSCs used for cell therapy and that the therapeutic potential of MSCs cultured in hypoxia warrants further investigation.

However, the cellular hierarchy underlying PDAC cell diversity is unknown. Here we identify the tetraspanin CD9 as a marker of PDAC tumour-initiating cells. CD9(high) cells had increased organoid formation capability, and generated tumour grafts in vivo at limiting dilutions. Tumours initiated from CD9(high) cells recapitulated the cellular heterogeneity of primary PDAC, whereas CD9(low) cells produced only duct-like epithelial progeny. CD9 knockdown decreased the growth of PDAC organoids, and heterozygous CD9 deletion in Pdxl-Cre; LSL-KRas(G)(12)(D); p53(F)(/F) mice prolonged overall survival. Mechanistically, CD9 promoted the plasma membrane localization of the glutamine transporter ASCT2, enhancing glutamine uptake in PDAC cells. Thus, our study identifies a PDAC subpopulation capable of initiating PDAC and giving rise to PDAC heterogeneity, suggesting that the cellular diversity of PDAC is generated by PDAC stem cell differentiation.

Tumor heterogeneity and the existence of distinct cell subpopulations exhibiting different genotypes and biological behaviors raise difficulties to eradicate all tumorigenic cells. Recent evidence indicates that a distinct population of tumor cells, called cancer stem cells (CSC), is involved in tumor initiation and recurrence and is a putative cause of tumor radioresistance. There is an urgent need to identify the intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating the generation and maintenance of resistance to radiotherapy, especially within the CSC subset. The chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, being involved in chemotaxis, stemness and drug resistance. The interaction of CXCR4 with its ligand, the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12), plays an important role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis and CSC niche. Moreover, the therapeutic inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling pathway is sensitizing the malignant cells to conventional anti-cancer therapy. Content : Within this review we are summarizing the role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in the modulation of CSC properties, the regulation of the tumor microenvironment in response to irradiation, therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Conclusion : In light of recent findings, the inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic option to refine radiotherapy.

Recent studies indicate that the transition between epithelial and mesenchymal states is a multi-step and reversible process in which several intermediate phenotypes might coexist. These intermediate states correspond to various forms of stem-like cells in the EMT system, but the function of the multi-step transition or the multiple stem cell phenotypes is unclear. Here, we use mathematical models to show that multiple intermediate phenotypes in the EMT system help to attenuate the overall fluctuations of the cell population in terms of phenotypic compositions, thereby stabilizing a heterogeneous cell population in the EMT spectrum. We found that the ability of the system to attenuate noise on the intermediate states depends on the number of intermediate states, indicating the stem-cell population is more stable when it has more sub-states. Our study reveals a novel advantage of multiple intermediate EMT phenotypes in terms of systems design, and it sheds light on the general design principle of heterogeneous stem cell population.

We have successfully fabricated the cartilage/NRL biocomposites via hMSCs spheroid under hypoxic condition, where the administration of NRL nanoparticles exhibits the suppression of the spheroid contraction due to the cellular proliferation of hMSCs. It has been found that the NRL nanoparticles acted as a main component, which provides surface heterogeneity of the spheroid, leading to the mechanically stable structure with higher modulus in comparison with the control as revealed by atomic force microscopy microindentation. Under hypoxia condition, the effective gene expression of in vitro chondrogenesis of hMSCs with administration of NRL was confirmed as revealed by the chondrogenic gene expression analysis compared with that under normoxia condition.					okamoto, masami/0000-0002-5732-1652												2055-0324	2055-0332					2020	6	4					137	148		10.1080/20550324.2020.1851438		NOV 2020					WOS:000598437500001

E/M cells are not homogenous but, in vitro and in vivo, contain subsets that can be distinguished based on a number of phenotypic features, including the subcellular localization of E-cadherin, and the expression levels of Tie2, CD133, and CD44. A cellular subset (E/M-MP) (membrane E-cadherin(low)/cytoplasmic E-cadherin(high)/CD133(high), CD44(high), Tie2(low)) is highly enriched for tumor-forming cells and displays features which are generally associated with cancer stem cells. Our data suggest that E/M-MP cells are able to differentiate into different lineages under certain conditions, and have the capacity for self-renewal, i.e. to maintain a subset of undifferentiated E/M-MP cells during differentiation. Trans-differentiation of E/M-MP cells into mesenchymal or epithelial cells is associated with a loss of stem cell markers and tumorigenicity. In vivo xenograft tumor growth is driven by E/M-MP cells, which give rise to epithelial ovarian cancer cells. In contrast, in vitro, we found that E/M-MP cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells, in a process that involves pathways associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. We also detected phenotypic plasticity that was dependent on external factors such as stress created by starvation or contact with either epithelial or mesenchymal cells in co-cultures. Our study provides a better understanding of the phenotypic complexity of ovarian cancer and has implications for ovarian cancer therapy.

J	Lee, N; Barthel, SR; Schatton, T				Lee, Nayoung; Barthel, Steven R.; Schatton, Tobias			Melanoma stem cells and metastasis: mimicking hematopoietic cell trafficking?	LABORATORY INVESTIGATION												Malignant melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer that bears responsibility for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Amidst the research efforts to better understand melanoma progression, there has been increasing evidence that hints at a role for a subpopulation of virulent cancer cells, termed malignant melanoma stem or initiating cells (MMICs), in metastasis formation. MMICs are characterized by their preferential ability to initiate and propagate tumor growth and their selective capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into less tumorigenic melanoma cells. The frequency of MMICs has been shown to correlate with poor clinical prognosis in melanoma. In addition, MMICs are enriched among circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients, suggesting that MMICs may be a critical factor in the metastatic cascade. Although these links exist between MMICs and metastatic disease, the mechanisms by which MMICs may advance metastatic progression are only beginning to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown that MMICs express molecules critical for hematopoietic cell maintenance and trafficking, providing a possible explanation for how circulating MMICs could drive melanoma dissemination. We therefore propose that MMICs might fuel melanoma metastasis by exploiting homing mechanisms commonly utilized by hematopoietic cells. Here we review the biological properties of MMICs and the existing literature on their metastatic potential. We will discuss possible mechanisms by which MMICs might initiate metastases in the context of established knowledge of cancer stem cells in other cancers and of hematopoietic homing molecules, with a particular focus on selectins, integrins, chemokines and chemokine receptors known to be expressed by melanoma cells. Biological understanding of how these molecules might be utilized by MMICs to propel the metastatic cascade could critically impact the development of more effective therapies for advanced disease.

Tissue homeostasis requires coordinated actions of epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. However, the extent of heterogeneity within the human oral mucosa and how tissue cell types are affected during the course of disease progression is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling we reveal a striking remodelling of the epithelial and mesenchymal niches with a decrease in functional populations that are linked to the aetiology of the disease. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identify potential intercellular hubs driving the inflammatory component of the disease. Our work establishes a reference map of the human oral mucosa in health and disease, and a framework for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

J	Badve, S; Nakshatri, H				Badve, Sunil; Nakshatri, Harikrishna			Breast-cancer stem cells-beyond semantics	LANCET ONCOLOGY												Intratumoral heterogeneity in breast cancer is well documented. Although the mechanisms leading to this heterogeneity are not understood, a subpopulation of cancer cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), that have some phenotypic similarities with adult tissue stem cells, has been suggested to contribute to tumour heterogeneity. It has been postulated that these CSCs are dormant, and by virtue of their low proliferative activity and ability to exclude intracellular toxins, are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These cells were initially isolated based on the presence of markers such as CD44, CD24, and ALDH1, with further characterisation using mammosphere assay and transplantation into immunodeficient mice. The CSC hypothesis raises several theoretical and practical questions. Does cancer arise in normal mammary stem cells or do some malignant cells acquire a CSC phenotype through clonal evolution? Are CSCs in different molecular (intrinsic) subtypes of breast cancer similar, or do they have distinct properties based on the subtype? Does the CSC phenotype reflect plasticity or the dynamic nature of a few cancer cells? How do these cells acquire invasive behaviour, as they go through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and then revert to epithelial phenotype at sites of metastasis in response to tumour microenvironmental and metastasis site-specific cues? It is increasingly recognised that the methods and assays used for identifying CSCs have substantial limitations; does this negate the entire concept? In this Personal View, we argue that the CSC phenotype represents an aggressive clone that survives in an adverse environment through constant evolution and integration of various hallmarks of cancer. This evolution could involve acquiring mutations that permit asymmetric and symmetric division, converting the host immune attack to its own advantage, and plasticity to adapt to sites of metastasis through reversible change in adhesion molecules. We also argue that the cell-type origin of cancer could affect the rate at which CSCs develop in a tumour, with an eventual effect on disease outcome.

Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapy is emerging as a promising treatment avenue for HIE. However, despite its enormous potential, the clinical application of MSCs is limited by cell heterogeneity, low isolation efficiency and unpredictable effectiveness. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of human pluripotent stem cell-derived ectomesenchymal stromal cells (hPSC-EMSCs) in a rat model of HIE. Methods: hPSC-EMSCs were induced from either human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Stem cells or the conditioned medium (CM) derived from stem cells were delivered intracranially or intranasally to neonatal rats with HIE. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) were used as the therapeutic comparison control and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control. Lesion size, apoptosis, neurogenesis, astrogliosis and microgliosis were evaluated. The rotarod test and Morris water maze were used to determine brain functional recovery. The PC-12 cell line, rat primary cortical neurons and neural progenitor cells were used to evaluate neurite outgrowth and the neuroprotective and neurogenesis effects of hPSC-EMSCs/hUC-MSCs. RNA-seq and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to determine the secretory factors that were differentially expressed between hPSC-EMSCs and hUC-MSCs. The activation and suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were characterised using western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Results: hPSC-EMSCs showed a higher neuroprotective potential than hUC-MSCs, as demonstrated by a more significant reduction in lesion size and apoptosis in the rat brain following hypoxia-ischaemia (HI). Compared with PBS treatment, hPSC-EMSCs promoted endogenous neurogenesis and alleviated astrogliosis and microgliosis. hPSC-EMSCs were more effective than hUC-MSCs. hPSC-EMSCs achieved a greater recovery of brain function than hUC-MSCs and PBS in rats with HIE. CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs had neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in vitro through anti-apoptotic and neurite outgrowth- and neurogenesis-promoting effects. Direct comparisons between hPSC-EMSCs and hUC-MSCs revealed the significant enrichment of a group of secretory factors in hPSC-EMSCs, including nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor-AA and transforming growth factor-beta(2), which are involved in neurogenesis, synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter transport, respectively. Mechanistically, the CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs was found to potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and the neuronal differentiation of NPCs via the ERK/CREB pathway. Suppression of ERK or CREB abolished CM-potentiated neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Finally, intranasal delivery of the CM derived from hPSC-EMSCs significantly reduced brain lesion size, promoted endogenous neurogenesis, mitigated inflammatory responses and improved functional recovery in rats with HIE. Conclusion: hPSC-EMSCs promote functional recovery after HI through multifaceted neuromodulatory activities via paracrine/trophic mechanisms. We propose the use of hPSC-EMSCs for the treatment of HIE, as they offer an excellent unlimited cellular source of MSCs.																	1838-7640						2022	12	1					143	166		10.7150/thno.57234							WOS:000719239800001

Heterogeneity and immunophenotypic plasticity of malignant cells in human liposarcomas	STEM CELL RESEARCH												Liposarcomas are tumors arising in white adipose tissue (WAT) with avidity for local recurrence. Aggressive dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLS) may arise from well-differentiated subtypes (WDLS) upon disease progression, however, this key issue is unresolved due in large part to knowledge gaps about liposarcoma cellular composition. Here, we wished to improve insights into liposarcoma cellular hierarchy. Tumor section analysis indicated that the populations, distinguishable based on the expression of CD34 (a marker of adipocyte progenitors) and CD36 (a marker of adipocyte differentiation), occupy distinct intra-tumoral locations in both WDLS and DDLS. Taking advantage of these markers, we separated cells from a panel of fresh human surgical specimens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Based on chromosome analysis and the culture phenotypes of the composing populations, we demonstrate that malignant cells comprise four mesenchymal populations distinguished by the expression of CD34 and CD36, while vascular (CD31+) and hematopoietic (CD45+) components are non-neoplastic. Finally, we show that mouse xenografts are derivable from both CD36-negative and CD36-positive DDLS cells, and that each population recreates the heterogeneity of CD36 expression in vivo. Combined, our results show that malignant cells in WDLS and DDLS can be classified according to distinct stages of adipogenesis and indicate immunophenotypic plasticity of malignant liposarcoma cells.

The aim of this work was to study possible MSC abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in relationship to the degree of BM fibrosis. MSCs were isolated from BM of 6 healthy donors (HD) and of 23 MPN patients, classified in 3 groups according to the diagnosis and the grade of BM fibrosis: polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia (PV/ET), low fibrosis myelofibrosis (LF-MF), and high fibrosis MF (HF-MF). MSC cultures were established from 21 of 23 MPN patients. MPN-derived MSCs did not exhibit any functional impairment in their adipogenic/osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation potential and displayed a phenotype similar to HD-derived MSCs but with a decreased expression of CD146. All MPN-MSC lines were negative for the patient-specific hematopoietic clone mutations (JAK2, MPL, CALR). MSCs derived from HF-MF patients displayed a reduced clonogenic potential and a lower growth kinetic compared to MSCs from HD, LF-MF, and PV/ET patients. mRNA levels of hematopoiesis regulatory molecules were unaffected in MSCs from HF-MF compared to HD. Finally,in vitroActivinA secretion by MSCs was increased in HF-MF compared to LF-MF patients, in association with a lower hemoglobin value. Increased ActivinA immunolabeling on stromal cells and erythroid precursors was also observed in HF-MF BM biopsies. In conclusion, higher grade of BM fibrosis is associated with functional impairment of MSCs and the increased secretion of ActivinA may represent a suitable target for anemia treatment in MF patients.

They are increasingly recognized as highly heterogeneous, but there is no consensus on subpopulations or discriminative markers for each subtype. We completed scRNA-seq analysis of mesenchymal cells from the embryonic, postnatal, adult and aged fibrotic lungs of mice and humans. We consistently identified and delineated the transcriptome of lipofibroblasts, myofibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, mesothelial cells, and a novel population characterized by Ebf1 expression. Subtype selective transcription factors and putative divergence of the clusters during development were described. Comparative analysis revealed orthologous subpopulations with conserved transcriptomic signatures in murine and human lung mesenchymal cells.

J	Huang, S; Jin, M; Su, N; Chen, L				Huang, Shuo; Jin, Min; Su, Nan; Chen, Lin			New insights on the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Bone possesses a remarkable repair capacity to regenerate completely without scar tissue formation. This unique characteristic, expressed during bone development, maintenance and injury (fracture) healing, is performed by the reparative cells including skeletal stem cells (SSCs) and their descendants. However, the identity and functional roles of SSCs remain controversial due to technological difficulties and the heterogeneity and plasticity of SSCs. Moreover, for many years, there has been a biased view that bone marrow is the main cell source for bone repair. Together, these limitations have greatly hampered our understanding of these important cell populations and their potential applications in the treatment of fractures and skeletal diseases. Here, we reanalyse and summarize current understanding of the reparative cells in bone regeneration and repair and outline recent progress in this area, with a particular emphasis on the temporal and spatial process of fracture healing, the sources of reparative cells, an updated definition of SSCs, and markers of skeletal stem/progenitor cells contributing to the repair of craniofacial and long bones, as well as the debate between SSCs and pericytes. Finally, we also discuss the existing problems, emerging novel technologies and future research directions in this field.

Phenotype plasticity rather than repopulation from CD90/CK14+cancer stem cells leads to cisplatin resistance of urothelial carcinoma cell lines	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH												Background: Tumour heterogeneity and resistance to systemic treatment in urothelial carcinoma (UC) may arise from cancer stem cells (CSC). A recent model describes cellular differentiation states within UC based on corresponding expression of surface markers (CD) and cytokeratins (CK) with CD90 and CK14 positive cells representing the least differentiated and most tumourigenic population. Based on the fact that this population is postulated to constitute CSCs and the origin of cisplatin resistance, we enriched urothelial carcinoma cell lines (UCCs) for CD90 and studied the tumour-initiating potential of these separated cells in vitro. Methods: Magnetic-and fluorescence-activated-cell sorting were used for separation of CD90(+) and CD90(-) UCCs. Distribution of cell surface markers CD90, CD44, and CD49f and cytokeratins CK14, CK5, and CK20 as well as the effects of short- and long-term treatment with cisplatin were assessed in vitro and measured by qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, reporter assay and flow cytometry in 11 UCCs. Results: We observed cell populations with surface markers according to those reported in tumour xenografts. However, expression of cytokeratins did not concord regularly with that of the surface markers. In particular, expression of CD90 and CK14 diverged during enrichment of CD90(+) cells by immunomagnetic sorting or following cisplatin treatment. Enriched CD90(+) cells did not exhibit CSC-like characteristics like enhanced clonogenicity and cisplatin resistance. Moreover, selection of cisplatin-resistant sublines by long-term drug treatment did not result in enrichment of CD90(+) cells. Rather, these sublines displayed significant phenotypic plasticity expressing EMT markers, an altered pattern of CKs, and WNT-pathway target genes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the correspondence between CD surface markers and cytokeratins reported in xenografts is not maintained in commonly used UCCs and that CD90 may not be a stable marker of CSC in UC. Moreover, UCCs cells are capable of substantial phenotypic plasticity that may significantly contribute to the emergence of cisplatin resistance.

Recent insights into the identity of mesenchymal stem cells: Implications for orthopaedic applications	BONE & JOINT JOURNAL												The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate in vitro into chondrocytes, osteocytes and myocytes holds great promise for tissue engineering. Skeletal defects are emerging as key targets for treatment using MSCs due to the high responsiveness of bone to interventions in animal models. Interest in MSCs has further expanded in recognition of their ability to release growth factors and to adjust immune responses. Despite their increasing application in clinical trials, the origin and role of MSCs in the development, repair and regeneration of organs have remained unclear. Until recently, MSCs could only be isolated in a process that requires culture in a laboratory; these cells were being used for tissue engineering without understanding their native location and function. MSCs isolated in this indirect way have been used in clinical trials and remain the reference standard cellular substrate for musculoskeletal engineering. The therapeutic use of autologous MSCs is currently limited by the need for ex vivo expansion and by heterogeneity within MSC preparations. The recent discovery that the walls of blood vessels harbour native precursors of MSCs has led to their prospective identification and isolation. MSCs may therefore now be purified from dispensable tissues such as lipoaspirate and returned for clinical use in sufficient quantity, negating the requirement for ex vivo expansion and a second surgical procedure. In this annotation we provide an update on the recent developments in the understanding of the identity of MSCs within tissues and outline how this may affect their use in orthopaedic surgery in the future.

J	Tien, PC; Quan, MC; Kuang, SH				Tien, Pei-Chieh; Quan, Menchus; Kuang, Shihuan			Sustained activation of notch signaling maintains tumor-initiating cells in a murine model of liposarcoma	CANCER LETTERS												Cells in a tumor are heterogeneous, often including a small number of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and the majority of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. We have previously reported that constitutive activation of Notch signaling in adipocytes of mice leads to dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS), an aggressive liposarcoma (LPS) with no effective treatment. Here, we explored the role of Notch signaling in cellular heterogeneity of LPS. We performed serial transplantations to enrich for TICs, and derived cells exhibiting sustained Notch activation (mLPS1 cells) and cells with normal Notch activity (mLPS2 cells). Both mLPS1 and mLPS2 cells proliferated rapidly, and neither exhibited contact inhibition. However, only the mLPS1 cells exhibited tumorigenicity and gave rise to LPS upon engraftment into mice. The mLPS1 cells also highly expressed markers of cancer stem cells (Cd133), mesenchymal stem cells (Cd73, Cd90, Cd105, Dlk1) and the long non-coding RNA Rian. By contrast, the mLPS2 cells accumulated lipid droplets and expressed mature adipocyte markers when induced to differentiate. Most importantly, CRISPR-mediated disruption of Notch abrogated the tumorigenic properties of mLPS1 cells. These results reveal a key role of Notch signaling in maintaining TICs in LPS.

Diabetes impairs the angiogenic potential of adipose-derived stem cells by selectively depleting cellular subpopulations	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Introduction: Pathophysiologic changes associated with diabetes impair new blood vessel formation and wound healing. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (ASCs) have been used clinically to promote healing, although it remains unclear whether diabetes impairs their functional and therapeutic capacity. Methods: In this study, we examined the impact of diabetes on the murine ASC niche as well as on the potential of isolated cells to promote neovascularization in vitro and in vivo. A novel single-cell analytical approach was used to interrogate ASC heterogeneity and subpopulation dynamics in this pathologic setting. Results: Our results demonstrate that diabetes alters the ASC niche in situ and that diabetic ASCs are compromised in their ability to establish a vascular network both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, these diabetic cells were ineffective in promoting soft tissue neovascularization and wound healing. Single-cell transcriptional analysis identified a subpopulation of cells which was diminished in both type 1 and type 2 models of diabetes. These cells were characterized by the high expression of genes known to be important for new blood vessel growth. Conclusions: Perturbations in specific cellular subpopulations, visible only on a single-cell level, represent a previously unreported mechanism for the dysfunction of diabetic ASCs. These data suggest that the utility of autologous ASCs for cell-based therapies in patients with diabetes may be limited and that interventions to improve cell function before application are warranted.

Stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth: a narrative synthesis of literature	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES												BACKGROUND: Stem Cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth (SHEDs) represent an immature stem cell population, easily accessible without ethical concerns, able to induce pluripotent stem cells and to differentiate in osteoblasts, hepatocytes, adipocytes, neural cells, chondrocytes, myocytes, skin cells and odontoblasts. AIM: The purpose of this review is to present a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge of SHEDs, through the description of their tissue sources, properties, differentiation potential, and comparative assessment of their advantages for tissue engineering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Medscape and Web of Science) from 2003 to 30 September 2013 and scanning references lists of the included publications and of the reviews. No publication date or publication status restrictions were imposed. Only evidence available in English language was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 72 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Clinical heterogeneity didn't allow for meta-analysis but only for a narrative synthesis. The outcomes of the present narrative synthesis are presented separately for methods of isolation and culture, characterization of SHEDs, differentiation in vitro and in vivo, use in animal model, and stem cell banking. CONCLUSIONS: SHEDs display multifactorial potential such as strong and high proliferative capacity, easy accessibility, high viability and multilineage differentiation capacity. Their retrieval is relatively simple and non-invasive, no risks for developing immune reactions or rejection following transplantation exist and no immunosuppressive therapy is needed.

J	Raniszewska, A; Domagala-Kulawik, J				Raniszewska, Agata; Domagala-Kulawik, Joanna			Lung cancer stem cells - the role in pathogenesis and progressive growth of cancer	POSTEPY HIGIENY I MEDYCYNY DOSWIADCZALNEJ												Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer death worldwide. Rapid accurate diagnosis, recognition of risk factors and improvement of treatment efficacy represent the main challenges. An advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, observed in the majority of cases, makes the introduction of radical treatment impossible or ineffective. Immunotherapy was a breakthrough in achieving long-term survival in recent years. The reason for developing this type of treatment is to know the interaction between the host cells and tumor cells. Cancer stem cells theory is increasingly gaining greater significance in the world. The biological heterogeneity of lung cancer may be due to the presence of a small percentage of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are the results of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal stem cells, progenitor cells or differentiated cells. CSCs are functionally defined by their unlimited self-renewal capacity, multiple differentiation and their ability to imitate tumors. It is believed that CSCs determine unrestricted growth of tumors and their different morphology. Their ability to self-renew can be the cause of relapses even after long periods of remission. CSCs reside in niches, where they receive signals for differentiation and proliferation process. The identification of CSCs is based on the presence of specific molecules (CD133, CD44, CD90, ALDH, EpCAM). An important feature of CSCs is their resistance to conventional cancer treatment: radio therapy and chemotherapy. Presumably, CSCs are responsible for the synthesis of immunosuppressive particles, and recruiting other molecules, which have immunosuppressive properties. The paper presents the current state of knowledge on CSCs in lung cancer detailing adenocarcinoma.																	0032-5449	1732-2693				DEC 31	2017	71						1251	1263		10.5604/01.3001.0010.7750							WOS:000419362500005

Basal/HER2 breast carcinomas Integrating molecular taxonomy with cancer stem cell dynamics to predict primary resistance to trastuzumab (Herceptin)	CELL CYCLE												High rates of inherent primary resistance to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) are frequent among HER2 gene-amplified breast carcinomas in both metastatic and adjuvant settings. The clinical efficacy of trastuzumab is highly correlated with its ability to specifically and efficiently target HER2-driven populations of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Intriguingly, many of the possible mechanisms by which cancer cells escape trastuzumab involve many of the same biomarkers that have been implicated in the biology of CS-like tumor-initiating cells. In the traditional, one-way hierarchy of CSCs in which all cancer cells descend from special self-renewing CSCs, HER2-positive CSCs can occur solely by self-renewal. Therefore, by targeting CSC self-renewal and resistance, trastuzumab is expected to induce tumor shrinkage and further reduce breast cancer recurrence rates when used alongside traditional therapies. In a new, alternate model, more differentiated non-stem cancer cells can revert to trastuzumab-refractory, CS-like cells via the activation of intrinsic or microenvironmental paths-to-stemness, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Alternatively, stochastic transitions of trastuzumab-responsive CSCs might also give rise to non-CSC cellular states that lack major attributes of CSCs and, therefore, can remain "hidden" from trastuzumab activity. Here, we hypothesize that a better understanding of the CSC/non-CSC social structure within HER2-overexpressing breast carcinomas is critical for trastuzumab-based treatment decisions in the clinic. First, we decipher the biological significance of CSC features and the EMT on the molecular effects and efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Second, we reinterpret the genetic heterogeneity that differentiates trastuzumab responders from non-responders in terms of CSC cellular states. Finally, we propose that novel predictive approaches aimed at better forecasting early tumor responses to trastuzumab should identify biological determinants that causally underlie the intrinsic flexibility of HER2-positive CSCs to "enter" into or "exit" from trastuzumab-sensitive states. An accurate integration of CSC cellular states and EMT-related biomarkers with the currently available breast cancer molecular taxonomy may significantly improve our ability to make a priori decisions about whether patients belonging to HER2 subtypes differentially enriched with a "mesenchymal transition signature" (e.g., luminal/HER2 vs. basal/HER2) would distinctly benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy ab initio.

The proliferative capacity of MDA-MSC-hyb5 cells was enhanced about 1.8-fold when compared to the parental MDA-MB-231(cherry) breast cancer cells. In contrast to a spontaneous MDA-MB-231(cherry) induced tumor development in vivo within 18.8 days, the MDA-MSC-hyb5 cells initially remained quiescent in a dormancy-like state. At distinct time points after injection, NODscid mice started to develop MDA-MSC-hyb5 cell-induced tumors up to about a half year later. Following tumor initiation, however, tumor growth and formation of metastases in various different organs occurred rapidly within about 10.5 days. Changes in gene expression levels were evaluated by RNA-microarray analysis and revealed certain increase in dormancy-associated transcripts in MDA-MSC-hyb5. Chemotherapeutic responsiveness of MDA-MSC-hyb5 cells was partially enhanced when compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. However, some resistance, e.g., for taxol was detectable in cancer hybrid cells. Moreover, drug response partially changed during the tumor development of MDA-MSC-hyb5 cells; this suggests the presence of unstable in vivo phenotypes of MDA-hyb5 cells with increased tumor heterogeneity.

Precise mechanisms related to cancer invasion and metastasis still remain unknown due to their complexities. Development of tumor microenvironment (TME)-mimicking system could play a key role in understanding cancer environments and in elucidating the relating phenomena and their driving forces. Here we report a facile and novel platform of 3D cancer cell-clusters using human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) within a collagen gel matrix to show cancer invasion in the cell and extracellular matrix (ECM). Both clusters A (hASC only) and AC (hASC and MDA-MB-231) exhibited different behaviors and expressions of migration and invasion, as observed by the relating markers such as fibronectin, alpha-SMA, and CXCR4. hASCs showed a protrusive migration from a cluster center, whereas MDA-MB-231 spread out radially followed by hASC migration. Finally, the effect of matrix was further discussed by varying collagen gel densities. The new biomimetic system of 3D cancer clusters developed here has the potential to be utilized for research on migration and invasion of cancer cells in extracellular matrices.																	1543-8384					JUL	2016	13	7					2204	2213		10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00953							WOS:000379455800009	27163860

Adipose-derived progenitor/stem cells (ASCs) are discussed as a promising candidate for various tissue engineering approaches. However, its applicability for the clinic is still difficult due to intra-and inter-donor heterogeneity and limited life span in vitro, influencing differentiation capacity as a consequence to decreased multipotency. Methods. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment has been proven to be a suitable clinical tool to improve regeneration of a variety of tissues for several decades, whereas the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain widely unknown. Results. In this study we show that human and rat adipose derived stem cells respond strongly to repetitive shock wave treatment in vitro, resulting not only in maintenance and significant elevation of mesenchymal markers (CD73, CD90, CD105), but also in significantly increased differentiation capacity towards the osteogenic and adipogenic lineage as well as toward Schwann-cell like cells even after extended time in vitro, preserving multipotency of ASCs. Conclusions. ESWT might be a promising tool to improve ASC quality for cell therapy in various tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

In this study, we analyzed the amniotic membrane (AM) from the human placenta with the aim of mapping different regions with respect to their morpho-functional features and regenerative potential. AMs were obtained from 24 healthy women, undergoing a caesarean section, and mapped into 4 different regions according to their position in relation to the umbilical cord: the central, intermediate, peripheral, and reflected areas. We carried out a multiparametric analysis focusing our attention on amniotic epithelial cells (AECs). Our results revealed that AECs, isolated from the different areas, are a heterogeneous cell population with different pluripotency and proliferation marker expression (octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [OCT-4], tyrosine-protein kinase KIT [c-KIT], sex determining region Y-box 2 [SOX-2], a-fetoprotein, cyclic AMP response element binding [CREB] protein, and phosphorylated active form of CREB [p-CREB]), proliferative ability, and osteogenic potential.

High Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Activity Identifies a Subset of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells with Vascular Regenerative Potential	STEM CELLS												During culture expansion, multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentially express aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an intracellular detoxification enzyme that protects long-lived cells against oxidative stress. Thus, MSC selection based on ALDH-activity may be used to reduce heterogeneity and distinguish MSC subsets with improved regenerative potency. After expansion of human bone marrow-derived MSCs, cell progeny was purified based on low versus high ALDH-activity (ALDH(hi)) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and each subset was compared for multipotent stromal and provascular regenerative functions. Both ALDH(lo) and ALDH(hi) MSC subsets demonstrated similar expression of stromal cell (>95% CD73(+), CD90(+), CD105(+)) and pericyte (>95% CD146(+)) surface markers and showed multipotent differentiation into bone, cartilage, and adipose cells in vitro. Conditioned media (CDM) generated by ALDH(hi) MSCs demonstrated a potent proliferative and prosurvival effect on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) under serum-free conditions and augmented HMVEC tube-forming capacity in growth factor-reduced matrices. After subcutaneous transplantation within directed in vivo angiogenesis assay implants into immunodeficient mice, ALDH(hi) MSC or CDM produced by ALDH(hi) MSC significantly augmented murine vascular cell recruitment and perfused vessel infiltration compared with ALDH(lo) MSC. Although both subsets demonstrated strikingly similar mRNA expression patterns, quantitative proteomic analyses performed on subset-specific CDM revealed the ALDH(hi) MSC subset uniquely secreted multiple proangiogenic cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor beta, platelet derived growth factor alpha, and angiogenin) and actively produced multiple factors with chemoattractant (transforming growth factor-beta, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1, 2, and 3 (GRO), C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (RANTES), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8) and matrix-modifying functions (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotinase 1 & 2 (TIMP1/2)). Collectively, MSCs selected for ALDH(hi) demonstrated enhanced proangiogenic secretory functions and represent a purified MSC subset amenable for vascular regenerative applications.

The use of a personalized liver organoid derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HuiPSCs) is advancing the use of in vitro disease models for the design of specific, effective therapies for individuals. Collecting patient peripheral blood cells for HuiPSC generation is preferable because it is less invasive; however, the capability of blood cell-derived HuiPSCs for hepatic differentiation and liver organoid formation remains uncertain. Moreover, the currently available methods for liver organoid formation require a multistep process of cell differentiation or a combination of hepatic endodermal, endothelial and mesenchymal cells, which is a major hurdle for the application of personalized liver organoids in high-throughput testing of drug toxicity and safety. To demonstrate the capability of blood cell-derived HuiPSCs for liver organoid formation without support from endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Methods. The peripheral blood-derived HuiPSCs first differentiated into hepatic endoderm (HE) in two-dimensional (2D) culture on Matrigel-coated plates under hypoxia for 10 days. The HE was then collected and cultured in 3D culture using 50% Matrigel under ambient oxygen. The maturation of hepatocytes was further induced by adding hepatocyte growth medium containing HGF and oncostatin M on top of the 3D culture and incubating the culture for an additional 12-17 days. The function of the liver organoids was assessed using expression analysis of hepatocyte-specific gene and proteins. Albumin (ALB) synthesis, glycogen and lipid storage, and metabolism of indocyanine were evaluated. The spatial distribution of albumin was examined using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Results. CD34+ hematopoietic cell-derived HuiPSCs were capable of differentiating into definitive endoderm expressing SOX17 and FOXA2, hepatic endoderm expressing FOXA2, hepatoblasts expressing AFP and hepatocytes expressing ALB. On day 25 of the 2D culture, cells expressed SOX17, FOXA2, AFP and ALB, indicating the presence of cellular heterogeneity. In contrast, the hepatic endoderm spontaneously formed a spherical, hollow structure in a 3D culture of 50% Matrigel, whereas hepatoblasts and hepatocytes could not form. Microscopic observation showed a single layer of polygonal-shaped cells arranged in a 3D structure. The hepatic endoderm-derived organoid synthesis ALB at a higher level than the 2D culture but did not express definitive endoderm-specific SOX17, indicating the greater maturity of the hepatocytes in the liver organoids. Confocal microscopic images and quantitative ELISA confirmed albumin synthesis in the cytoplasm of the liver organoid and its secretion. Overall, 3D culture of the hepatic endoderm is a relatively fast, simple, and less laborious way to generate liver organoids from HuiPSCs that is more physiologically relevant than 2D culture.					, Kasem/0000-0002-6652-9244												2167-8359					OCT 19	2020	8								e9968	10.7717/peerj.9968							WOS:000579332800008	33133779

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY												Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of cells to reversibly alter their phenotypes in response to signals, presents a significant clinical challenge to treating solid tumors. Tumor cells utilize phenotypic plasticity to evade therapies, metastasize, and colonize distant organs. As a result, phenotypic plasticity can accelerate tumor progression. A well-studied example of phenotypic plasticity is the bidirectional conversions among epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype(s). These conversions can alter a repertoire of cellular traits associated with multiple hallmarks of cancer, such as metabolism, immune evasion, invasion, and metastasis. To tackle the complexity and heterogeneity of these transitions, mathematical models have been developed that seek to capture the experimentally verified molecular mechanisms and act as 'hypothesis-generating machines'. Here, we discuss how these quantitative mathematical models have helped us explain existing experimental data, guided further experiments, and provided an improved conceptual framework for understanding how multiple intracellular and extracellular signals can drive E/M plasticity at both the single-cell and population levels. We also discuss the implications of this plasticity in driving multiple aggressive facets of tumor progression.

Yet, how BRCA1 suppresses formation of basal-like breast cancers is still obscure. Deletion of p18(Ink4c) (p18), an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, functionally inactivates the RB pathway, stimulates mammary luminal stem cell (LSC) proliferation, and leads to spontaneous luminal tumor development. Alternately, germline mutation of Brca1 shifts the fate of luminal cells to cause luminal-to-basal mammary tumor transformation. Here, we report that disrupting Brca1 by either germline or epithelium-specific mutation in p18-deficient mice activates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and induces dedifferentiation of LSCs, which associate closely with expansion of basal and cancer stem cells and formation of basal-like tumors. Mechanistically, BRCA1 bound to the TWIST promoter, suppressing its activity and inhibiting EMT in mammary tumor cells. In human luminal cancer cells, BRCA1 silencing was sufficient to activate TWIST and EMT and increase tumor formation. In parallel, TWIST expression and EMT features correlated inversely with BRCA1 expression in human breast cancers. Together, our findings showed that BRCA1 suppressed TWIST and EMT, inhibited LSC dedifferentiation, and repressed expansion of basal stem cells and basal-like tumors. Thus, our work offers the first genetic evidence that Brca1 directly suppresses EMT and LSC dedifferentiation during breast tumorigenesis. (C) 2014 AACR.

However, through comparison of such cells is lacking. This study aimed to compare the transcriptome of mesenchymal cells of the same phenotype isolated from the heart muscle and epicardial fat of the same patient, before and after culture. Methods and results Cells were isolated from biopsies of the right ventricle and epicardial fat collected from five patients (three men and two women, mean age 59.4 +/- 2.6) who underwent heart transplantation due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. In both tissues, immunophenotyping revealed three distinct populations: (i)CD31(-)CD45(-)CD90(+)CD34(+)CD146(-), (ii) CD31(-)CD45(-)CD90(+)CD34(-)CD146(+), and (iii) CD31(-)CD45(-)CD90(-)CD34(-)CD146(+), of which only the first one could be grown after sorting. Material for RNA-seq was collected from these cells before culture (250 cells) and at passage 6 (5000 cells). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that cells of the same phenotype (CD31(-)CD45(-)CD90(+)CD34(+)CD146 (-)) upon isolation preferentially clustered according to the tissue of origin, not to the patient from whom they were isolated. Genes up-regulated in the right ventricle-derived cells were related to muscle physiology while down-regulated genes included those encoding proteins with transmembrane signalling receptor activity. After six passages, heart-derived and fat-derived cells did not acquire similar transcriptome. Cells isolated from the right ventricle in comparison with their epicardial fat-derived counterparts demonstrated higher level of transcripts related, among others, to RNA processing and muscle development. The down-regulated genes were involved in the nucleosome assembly, DNA packaging and replication, and interleukin-7-mediated signalling pathway. Cells from epicardial fat demonstrated higher heterogeneity both before and after culture. Cell culture significantly changed gene expression profile within both tissues. Conclusions This study is an essential indication that mesenchymal cells isolated from different tissues do not demonstrate similar properties. Phenotypic identification and ease of isolation cannot be considered as a criterion in any therapeutic utilization of such cells.

The Basement Membrane of Hair Follicle Stem Cells Is a Muscle Cell Niche	CELL												The hair follicle bulge in the epidermis associates with the arrector pili muscle (APM) that is responsible for piloerection ("goosebumps''). We show that stem cells in the bulge deposit nephronectin into the underlying basement membrane, thus regulating the adhesion of mesenchymal cells expressing the nephronectin receptor, alpha 8 beta 1 integrin, to the bulge. Nephronectin induces alpha 8 integrin-positive mesenchymal cells to upregulate smooth muscle markers. In nephronectin knockout mice, fewer arrector pili muscles form in the skin, and they attach to the follicle above the bulge, where there is compensatory upregulation of the nephronectin family member EGFL6. Deletion of alpha 8 integrin also abolishes selective APM anchorage to the bulge. Nephronectin is a Wnt target; epidermal beta-catenin activation upregulates epidermal nephronectin and dermal alpha 8 integrin expression. Thus, bulge stem cells, via nephronectin expression, create a smooth muscle cell niche and act as tendon cells for the APM. Our results reveal a functional role for basement membrane heterogeneity in tissue patterning.

Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Human Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Identifies a Contractile Cell Subpopulation	STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												The potential for human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) to be used as a therapeutic product is being assessed in multiple clinical trials. However, much is still to be learned about these cells before they can be used with confidence in the clinical setting. An inherent characteristic of hASCs that is not well understood is their heterogeneity. The aim of this exploratory study was to characterize the heterogeneity of freshly isolated hASCs after two population doublings (P2) using single-cell transcriptome analysis. A minimum of two subpopulations were identified at P2. A major subpopulation was identified as contractile cells which, based on gene expression patterns, are likely to be pericytes and/or vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs).

Clonal Composition of Human Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells: Application of Genetic Barcodes in Research	BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW												Clonal composition of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) labeled with lentiviral vectors carrying genetic barcodes was studied. MMSCs were transduced with a cloned library of self-inactivating lentiviral vectors carrying 667 unique barcodes. At each cell culture passage, 120 cells were plated one cell per well in 96-well plates. The efficiency of cloning and labeling of the clonogenic cells was determined. DNA was extracted from the cell-derived colonies, and the barcodes were identified by Sanger sequencing. Also, DNA was extracted from the total MMSC population at each passage to analyze the diversity and representation of barcodes by deep sequencing using the Illumina platform. It was shown that the portion of MMSCs labeled with the lentiviral vectors remained stable in the passaged cells. Because of the high multiplicity of infection, the labeling procedure could decrease the proliferative potential of MMSCs. Identification of barcodes in individual cell clones confirmed the polyclonal character of the MMSC population. Clonal composition of MMSCs changed significantly with the passages due to the depletion of proliferative potential of most cells. Large clones were found at the first passage; at later passages, many small clones with a limited proliferative potential were detected in the population. The results of deep sequencing confirmed changes in the clonal composition of MMSCs. The polyclonal MMSC population contained only a small number of cells with a high proliferative potential, some of which could be stem cells. MMSCs with a high proliferative potential were detected more often in the earliest passages. In this regard, we would rec-ommend to use MMSCs of early passages for regenerative medicine applications based on cell proliferation.

Dysregulation of these two programs leads to the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent evidence suggests that CSCs are relatively resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for metastasis formation. Deciphering these processes will help understand oncogenesis and allow the development of new targeted therapies. Here, we have used a whole genome promoter microarray to establish the DNA methylation portraits of breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) and non-bCSCs. A total of 68 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were more hypomethylated in bCSCs than in non-bCSCs. Using a differentiation assay we demonstrated that DMRs are rapidly hypermethylated within the first 6 hours following induction of CSC differentiation whereas the cells reached the steady-state within 6 days, suggesting that these DMRs are linked to early CSC epigenetic regulation. These DMRs were significantly enriched in genes coding for TGF-beta signaling-related proteins. Interestingly, DMRs hypomethylation was correlated to an overexpression of TGF-beta signaling genes in a series of 109 breast tumors. Moreover, patients with tumors harboring the bCSC DMRs signature had a worse prognosis than those with non-bCSC DMRs signature. Our results show that bCSCs have a distinct DNA methylation landscape with TGF-beta signaling as a key epigenetic regulator of bCSCs differentiation.

However, the clinical applications of the traditional growth factors are limited by their high cost, functional heterogeneity and unpredictable effects, such as cyst formation. It may be advantageous for cartilage regeneration to identify a low-cost substitute with greater chondral specificity and easy accessibility. As a neuropeptide, nerve growth factor (NGF) was involved in cartilage metabolism and NGF is hypothesized to mediate the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. We isolated NGF from Chinese cobra venom using a three-step procedure that we had improved upon from previous studies, and investigated the chondrogenic potential of NGF on bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that NGF greatly upregulated the expression of cartilage-specific markers. When applied to cartilage repair for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, NGF-treated BMSCs have greater therapeutic effect than untreated BMSCs. Although inferior to TGF-beta 1 regarding its chondrogenic potential, NGF showed considerably lower expression of collagen type I, which is a fibrocartilage marker, and RUNX2, which is critical for terminal chondrocyte differentiation than TGF-beta 1, indicating its chondral specificity. Interestingly, NGF rarely induced BMSCs to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype, which may be due to the presence of other chondrogenic supplements. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism revealed that NGF-mediated chondrogenesis may be associated with the activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways via the specific receptor of NGF, TrkA. In addition, NGF is easily accessed because of the abundance and low price of cobra venom, as well as the simplified methods for separation and purification. This study was the first to demonstrate the chondrogenic potential of NGF, which may provide a reference for cartilage regeneration in the clinic.

Heterogeneity of Circulating Tumor Cells in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Breast Cancer	MOLECULES												The biological properties of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and their dynamics during neoadjuvant chemotherapy are important, both for disease progression prediction and therapeutic target determination, with the aim of preventing disease progression. The aim of our study was to estimate of different CTC subsets in breast cancer during the NACT (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). The prospective study includes 27 patients with invasive breast cancer, T2-4N0-3M0, aged 32 to 60 years. Venous heparinized blood samples, taken before and after biopsy, after each courses of chemotherapy (on days 3-7), and before surgical intervention, served as the material for this study. Different subsets of circulating tumor cells were determined on the basis of the expression of EpCAM, CD45, CD44, CD24, and N-Cadherin using flow cytometry. As the result of this study, it has been observed that significant changes in the quantity of the different subsets of circulating tumor cells in patients' blood were observed after carrying out the 3rd course of NACT. NACT causes significant changes in the quantity of six CTC subsets, with various combinations of stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties.

In addition, we knocked down SOX2 in primary spheres obtained from HNSCC tumour tissue and assessed the attenuation of stemness-associated traits in these cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we examined the clinical relevance of SOX2 expression in HNSCC patients. Results: SOX2 is aberrantly expressed in primary tissue of HNSCC patients but not in healthy tissue. SOX2 expression correlated with tumour recurrence and poor prognosis of HNSCC patients. Ectopic expression of SOX2 induced cell proliferation via cyclin B1 expression and stemness-associated features, such as self-renewal and chemoresistance. In addition, a knockdown of SOX2 in HNSCC CSCs attenuated their self-renewal capacity, chemoresistance through ABCG2 suppression), invasion capacity via snail downregulation), and in vivo tumorigenicity. Conclusions: These results suggest that SOX2 may have important roles in the 'stemness' and progression of HNSCC. Targeting SOX2-positive tumour cells CSCs) could be a new therapeutic strategy in HNSCCs.																	0007-0920	1532-1827				NOV 25	2014	111	11					2122	2130		10.1038/bjc.2014.528							WOS:000345597700012	25321191

Hence, articular cartilage regeneration remains a major challenge in orthopedics. Decellularized extracellular matrix- (ECM-) based strategies have recently received particular attention. The structure of native cartilage exhibits complex zonal heterogeneity. Specifically, the development of a tissue-engineered scaffold mimicking the aligned structure of native cartilage would be of great utility in terms of cartilage regeneration. Previously, we fabricated oriented PLGA/ACECM (natural, nanofibrous, articular cartilage ECM) composite scaffolds. In vitro, we found that the scaffolds not only guided seeded cells to proliferate in an aligned manner but also exhibited high biomechanical strength. To detect whether oriented cartilage regeneration was possible in vivo, we used mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)/scaffold constructs to repair cartilage defects. The results showed that cartilage defects could be completely regenerated. Histologically, these became filled with hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone. Moreover, the aligned structure of cartilage was regenerated and was similar to that of native tissue. In conclusion, the MSC/scaffold constructs enhanced the structure-specific regeneration of hyaline cartilage in a rabbit model and may be a promising treatment strategy for the repair of human cartilage defects.																	1687-966X	1687-9678					2018	2018								6542198	10.1155/2018/6542198							WOS:000426186900001	29666653

However, these therapies are often less effective due to heterogeneous MSC differentiation. Kartogenin (KGN), a synthetic small molecule that induces chondrogenesis, has recently been explored to decrease this heterogeneity. KGN has been encapsulated in nanoparticles due to its hydrophobicity. To explore the effect of nanoparticle properties on KGN and MSC interactions, here we fabricated three nanoparticle formulations that vary in hydrophobicity, size, and surface charge using nanoprecipitation: KGN-loaded poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (hydrophobic surface, negative charge, similar to 167 nm), PLGA-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanoparticles (hydrophilic surface, positive charge, similar to 297 nm), and PLGA-PEG-hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticles (hydrophilic surface, negative charge, similar to 507 nm). We observed differences in KGN loading, release, and suspension stability, with the PLGA particles exhibiting similar to 50% drug loading and PLGA-PEG-HA particles releasing the most KGN. All nanoparticles were found to interact with MSCs with evidence of increased uptake in PLGA-PEG and PLGA-PEG-HA compared with surface association of PLGA particles. Over short times (similar to 7 days), MSCs incubated with all KGN-loaded formulations exhibited a similar increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycans, characteristic of chondrogenic differentiation, compared with non-KGN loaded formulations.

Alex			Toward Exosome-Based Therapeutics: Isolation, Heterogeneity, and Fit-for-Purpose Potency	FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE												Exosomes are defined as submicron (30-150 nm), lipid bilayer- enclosed extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically generated by the late endosomal compartment through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Produced by almost all cells, exosomes were originally considered to represent just a mechanism for jettisoning unwanted cellular moieties. Although this may be a major function in most cells, evolution has recruited the endosomal membrane-sorting pathway to duties beyond mere garbage disposal, one of the most notable examples being its cooption by retroviruses for the generation of Trojan virions. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that certain cell types have evolved an exosome subclass active in intracellular communication. We term this EV subclass "signalosomes" and define them as exosomes that are produced by the "signaling" cells upon specific physiological or environmental cues and harbor cargo capable of modulating the programming of recipient cells. Our recent studies have established that signalosomes released by mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) represent the main vector of MSC immunomodulation and therapeutic action in animal models of lung disease. The efficacy of MSC-exosome treatments in a number of preclinical models of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease supports the promise of application of exosome-based therapeutics across a wide range of pathologies within the near future. However, the full realization of exosome therapeutic potential has been hampered by the absence of standardization in EV isolation, and procedures for purification of signalosomes from the main exosome population. This is mainly due to immature methodologies for exosome isolation and characterization and our incomplete understanding of the specific characteristics and molecular composition of signalosomes. In addition, difficulties in defining metrics for potency of exosome preparations and the challenges of industrial scale-up and good manufacturing practice compliance have complicated smooth and timely transition to clinical development. In this manuscript, we focus on cell culture conditions, exosome harvesting, dosage, and exosome potency, providing some empirical guidance and perspectives on the challenges in bringing exosome-based therapies to clinic.

However, given the cellular heterogeneity within cultivation and safety concerns, the development of specific and efficient tools to isolate a pure population and eliminate all residual undifferentiated PSCs from differentiated derivatives is a prerequisite for clinical applications. In this study, we raised a mono-clonal antibody and identified its target antigen as desmoglein-2 (DSG2). DSG2 co-localized with human PSC (hPSC)-specific cell surface markers, and its expression was rapidly downregulated upon differentiation. The depletion of DSG2 markedly decreased hPSC proliferation and pluripotency marker expression. In addition, DSG2-negative population in hPSCs exhibited a notable suppression in embryonic body and teratoma formation. The actions of DSG2 in regulating the self-renewal and pluripotency of hPSCs were predominantly exerted through the regulation of beta-catenin/Slug-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our results demonstrate that DSG2 is a valuable PSC surface marker that is essential for the maintenance of PSC self-renewal.

However, current tools for characterizing substrates' mechanical properties, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), often do not fully recapitulate the length and time scales over which cells 'feel' substrates. Here, we show that an immortalised, clonal line of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) maintains the responsiveness to substrate mechanics observed in primary cells, and can be used as a reporter of stiffness. MSCs were cultured on soft and stiff polyacrylamide hydrogels. In both primary and immortalised MSCs, stiffer substrates promoted increased cell spreading, expression of lamin-A/C and translocation of mechano-sensitive proteins YAP1 and MKL1 to the nucleus. Stiffness was also found to regulate transcriptional markers of lineage. A GFP-YAP/RFP-H2B reporter construct was designed and virally delivered to the immortalised MSCs for in situ detection of substrate stiffness. MSCs with stable expression of the reporter showed GFP-YAP to be colocalised with nuclear RFP-H2B on stiff substrates, enabling development of a cellular reporter of substrate stiffness. This will facilitate mechanical characterisation of new materials developed for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Herein, we report on the possibility of simultaneously isolating three subtypes of cells from one primary culture. Using a stainless steel instrument named a colony poculum, two of the three cell subtypes could be efficiently cultured, and these were further characterized. The results indicated that these two cell subtypes had different morphologies and were characterized by different cell marker expression profiles, including the differential expression of CD105, CD117 and EBAF. Furthermore, their gene expression array data revealed their different gene expression profiles. Although both cell types expressed several embryonic stem cell-specific markers, they were non-tumorigenic in vivo. This paper not only provides new insight into the heterogeneity of human amniotic fluid, it also presents a simple yet efficient cell isolation method. These results will contribute to the thorough investigation of the properties and potential future applications of human amniotic fluid-derived cells.																	1425-8153	1689-1392				SEP	2010	15	3					424	439		10.2478/s11658-010-0017-1							WOS:000278930100005	20499195

However, this fundamental concept has yet to be established for solid tumors including breast cancer. In this communication, we analyzed solid tumor cancer stem cell markers in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens using flow cytometry. The stem/progenitor cell properties of different marker expressing-cell populations were further assessed by in vitro soft agar colony formation assay and the ability to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We found that the expression of stem cell markers varied greatly among breast cancer cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 cells, PROCR and ESA, instead of the widely used breast cancer stem cell markers CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) and ALDH, could be used to highly enrich cancer stem/progenitor cell populations which exhibited the ability to self renew and divide asymmetrically. Furthermore, the PROCR(+)/ESA(+) cells expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. PROCR could also be used to enrich cells with colony forming ability from MB-361 cells. Moreover, consistent with the marker profiling using cell lines, the expression of stem cell markers differed greatly among primary tumors. There was an association between metastasis status and a high prevalence of certain markers including CD44(+)/CD24(-/low), ESA(+), CD133(+), CXCR4(+) and PROCR(+) in primary tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that similar to leukemia, several stem/progenitor cell-like subpopulations can exist in breast cancer.

Berna; Meuwissen, Ralph; Berns, Anton			A Functional Role for Tumor Cell Heterogeneity in a Mouse Model of Small Cell Lung Cancer	CANCER CELL												Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the lung neoplasia with the poorest prognosis, due to its high metastatic potential and chemoresistance upon relapse. Using the previously described mouse model for SCLC, we found that the tumors are often composed of phenotypically different cells with either a neuroendocrine or a mesenchymal marker profile. These cells had a common origin because they shared specific genomic aberrations. The transition from neuroendocrine to mesenchymal phenotype could be achieved by the ectopic expression of oncogenic Ras(V12). Crosstalk between mesenchymal and neuroendocrine cells strongly influenced their behavior. When engrafted as a mixed population, the mesenchymal cells endowed the neuroendocrine cells with metastatic capacity, illustrating the potential relevance of tumor cell heterogeneity in dictating tumor properties.																	1535-6108	1878-3686				FEB 15	2011	19	2					244	256		10.1016/j.ccr.2010.12.021							WOS:000287771500012	21316603

Because they need to be targeted for cancer treatment, they have been isolated from many solid cancers. However, cancer stem cells from primary human gastric cancer tissues have not been isolated as yet. For the isolation, we used two cell surface markers: the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD44. When analyzed by flow cytometry, the EpCAM(+)/CD44(+) population accounts for 4.5% of tumor cells. EpCAM(+)/CD44(+) gastric cancer cells formed tumors in immunocompromised mice; however, EpCAM(-)/CD44(-), EpCAM(+)/CD44(-) and EpCAM(-)/CD44(+) cells failed to do so. Xenografts of EpCAM(+)/CD44(+) gastric cancer cells maintained a differentiated phenotype and reproduced the morphological and phenotypical heterogeneity of the original gastric tumor tissues. The tumorigenic subpopulation was serially passaged for several generations without significant phenotypic alterations. Moreover, EpCAM(+)/CD44(+), but not EpCAM(-)/CD44(-), EpCAM(+)/CD44(-) or EpCAM(-)/CD44(+) cells grew exponentially in vitro as cancer spheres in serum-free medium, maintaining the tumorigenicity. Interestingly, a single cancer stem cell generated a cancer sphere that contained various differentiated cells, supporting multi-potency and self-renewal of a cancer stem cell. EpCAM(+)/CD44(+) cells had greater resistance to anti-cancer drugs than other subpopulation cells. The above in vivo and in vitro results suggest that cancer stem cells, which are enriched in the EpCAM(+)/CD44(+) subpopulation of gastric cancer cells, provide an ideal model system for cancer stem cell research.																	1420-682X	1420-9071				NOV	2011	68	21					3589	3605		10.1007/s00018-011-0672-z							WOS:000296469200012	21448722

The current therapy for GBM consists in concurrent radiation and chemotherapy following removal of the tumor. Although the therapy prolongs patient survival, recurrence often occurs. The major cause of tumor recurrence is thought to be GBM stem cells (GSCs), which aid the development of chemo-radiotherapy resistance, and can self-renew and aberrantly differentiate. Therefore, GSCs should be targeted to eradicate the tumor and prevent recurrence. Transcriptomic analysis has categorized GBM into proneural (PN), mesenchymal and classical subtypes, and the outcome of recurrence and prognosis markedly depends on subtype. To identify specific GSC markers, the present study analyzed public microarray and RNA-seq data and identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 5 (DRP5) as a candidate GSC marker. DRP5 is known to mediate semaphorin 3A signaling and is involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and axon guidance during neuronal development. In the present study, DRP5 was specifically upregulated in the PN-subtype GSCs and served crucial roles in maintaining GSC properties, including tumor sphere formation, stem cell marker expression and xenograft tumor growth. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis revealed that DRP5 expression was positively correlated with signatures of stemness, including Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt/beta -catenin expression, which are also known to be positively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Conversely, DRP5 expression was negatively correlated with NF-kappa B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stemness signatures, which are negatively correlated with PN-subtype gene signatures. Taken together, these findings suggested that DRP5 was specifically expressed in PN-subtype GSCs and may be used as a functional marker of PN-subtype GSCs.																	1792-1074	1792-1082				AUG	2020	20	2					1153	1162		10.3892/ol.2020.11668							WOS:000563832100018	32724355

NEURORESCUE EFFECTS AND STEM PROPERTIES OF CHORIONIC VILLI AND AMNIOTIC PROGENITOR CELLS	NEUROSCIENCE												The capability to integrate into degenerative environment, release neurotrophic cytokines, contrast oxidative stress and an inherent differentiation potential towards siteappropriate phenotypes are considered crucial for the use of stem cells in tissue repair and regeneration. Naive human chorial villi- (hCVCs) and amniotic fluid- (hAFCs) derived cells, whose properties and potentiality have not been extensively investigated, may represent two novel foetal cell sources for stem cell therapy. We previously described that long-term transplantation of hAFCs in the lateral ventricles of wobbler and healthy mice was feasible and safe. In the present study we examine the in vitro intrinsic stem potential of hCVCs and hAFCs for future therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disorders. Presence of stem lineages was evaluated assessing the expression pattern of relevant candidate markers by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immuno-cytochemistry. Release of cytokines that may potentialy sustain endogenous neurogenesis and/or activate neuroprotective pathways was quantified by enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assays (ELISAs). We also performed an in vitro neurorescue assay, wherein a neuroblastoma cell line damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-0HDA) was treated with hCVC/hAFC-derived conditioned medium (CM). Naive hCVCs/hAFCs show a neurogenic/angiogenic predisposition. Both cell types express several specific neural stem/progenitor markers, such as nestin and connexin 43, and release significant amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor. hCVC and hAFC populations comprise several interesting cell lineages, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cells with neural-like phenotypes. Moreover, although CMs obtained from both cell cultures actively sustained metabolic activity in a 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) cell model, only hCVC-derived CMs significantly reduced neurotoxin-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that naive hAFCs and hCVCs may enhance cell-recovery following neuronal damage through multiple rescue mechanisms, and may provide a suitable means of stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders including PD.

Multiple mesenchymal progenitor cell subtypes with distinct functional potential are present within the intimal layer of the hip synovium	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS												BackgroundThe synovial membrane adjacent to the articular cartilage is home to synovial mesenchymal progenitor cell (sMPC) populations that have the ability to undergo chondrogenesis. While it has been hypothesized that multiple subtypes of stem and progenitor cells exist in vivo, there is little evidence supporting this hypothesis in human tissues. Furthermore, in most of the published literature on this topic, the cells are cultured before derivation of clonal populations. This gap in the literature makes it difficult to determine if there are distinct MPC subtypes in human synovial tissues, and if so, if these sMPCs express any markers in vivo/in situ that provide information in regards to the function of specific MPC subtypes (e.g. cells with increased chondrogenic capacity)? Therefore, the current study was undertaken to determine if any of the classical MPC cell surface markers provide insight into the differentiation capacity of sMPCs.MethodsClonal populations of sMPCs were derived from a cohort of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and patients at high risk to develop OA using indexed cell sorting. Tri-differentiation potential and cell surface receptor expression of the resultant clones was determined.ResultsA number of clones with distinct differentiation potential were derived from this cohort, yet the most common cell surface marker profile on MPCs (in situ) that demonstrated chondrogenic potential was determined to be CD90(+)/CD44(+)/CD73(+). A validation cohort was employed to isolate cells with only this cell surface profile. Isolating cells directly from human synovial tissue with these three markers alone, did not enrich for cells with chondrogenic capacity.ConclusionsTherefore, additional markers are required to further discriminate the heterogeneous subtypes of MPCs and identify sMPCs with functional properties that are believed to be advantageous for clinical application.																	1471-2474					MAR 25	2019	20								125	10.1186/s12891-019-2495-2							WOS:000462711800001	30909916

Aging modulates the effects of ischemic injury upon mesenchymal cells within the renal interstitium and microvasculature	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												The renal mesenchyme contains heterogeneous cells, including interstitial fibroblasts and pericytes, with key roles in wound healing. Although healing is impaired in aged kidneys, the effect of age and injury on the mesenchyme remains poorly understood. We characterized renal mesenchymal cell heterogeneity in young vs old animals and after ischemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI) using multiplex immunolabeling and single cell transcriptomics. Expression patterns of perivascular cell markers (alpha-SMA, CD146, NG2, PDGFR-alpha, and PDGFR-beta) correlated with their interstitial location. PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta co-expression labeled renal myofibroblasts more efficiently than the current standard marker alpha-SMA, and CD146 was a superior murine renal pericyte marker. Three renal mesenchymal subtypes; pericytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts, were recapitulated with data from two independently performed single cell transcriptomic analyzes of murine kidneys, the first dataset an aging cohort and the second dataset injured kidneys following IRI. Mesenchymal cells segregated into subtypes with distinct patterns of expression with aging and following injury. Baseline uninjured old kidneys resembled post-ischemic young kidneys, with this phenotype further exaggerated following IRI. These studies demonstrate that age modulates renal perivascular/interstitial cell marker expression and transcriptome at baseline and in response to injury and provide tools for the histological and transcriptomic analysis of renal mesenchymal cells, paving the way for more accurate classification of renal mesenchymal cell heterogeneity and identification of age-specific pathways and targets.

To focus on soluble factor interactions occurring between mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells, a serum-free adhesion-independent culture system was developed that allows manipulation of the growth of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic human BM-derived progenitors and the balance between these compartments. Factorial experiments demonstrated a role for stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin 3 (IL-3) in the concomitant growth of hematopoietic (CD45(+)) and nonhematopoietic (CD45(-)) cells, as well as their derivatives. Kinetic tracking of IL-3 alpha receptor (CD123) and SCF receptor (CD117) expression on a sorted CD45(-) cell population revealed the emergence of CD45(-)CD123(+) cells capable of osteogenesis. Of the total fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-Fs) and osteoblast colony-forming units (CFU-O), approximately 24% of CFU-Fs and about 22% of CFU-Os were recovered from this population. Cell-sorting experiments demonstrated that the CD45(+) cell population secreted soluble factors that positively affect the survival and proliferation of CFU-Fs and CFU-Os generated from the CD45(-) cells. Together, our results provide insight into the intercellular cytokine network between hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells and provide a strategy to mutually culture both mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells in a defined scalable bioprocess.																	0006-4971	1528-0020				NOV 1	2005	106	9					3012	3019		10.1182/blood-2005-01-0433							WOS:000232917400022	16030193

The aim of this randomized controlled animal trial was a comparative analysis regarding the chondroregenerative potency of intra-articular stem/stromal cell therapy. Four weeks after combined mechanical and biochemical osteoarthritis induction in 28 rabbits, therapy was initiated by a single intra-articular injection, randomized into the following groups: Group 1: AB Serum (ABS); Group 2: Hyaluronic acid (HA); Group 3: Mesenchymal stromal cells (STx.); Group 4: Mesenchymal stromal cells in hyaluronic acid (HA + STx.). After another 4 weeks, the animals were euthanized, followed by histological examination of the removed joints. The histological analysis showed a significant increase in cartilage thickness in the stromal cell treated groups (HA + STx. vs. ABS, p = 0.028; HA + ST.x vs. HA, p = 0.042; STx. vs. ABS, p = 0.036). Scanning electron microscopy detected a similar heterogeneity of mineralization and tissue porosity in the subchondral zone in all groups. The single intra-articular injection of a stem cell containing, GMP-compliant advanced therapy medicinal product for the treatment of iatrogen induced osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint shows a chondroregenerative effect.				; Heiland, Max/E-8400-2013	Ahlers, M.

Hypoxia signaling through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) promotes angiogenesis and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on response to therapy as well as EMT and expression of stem cell markers in HNSCC cells. Five HNSCC cell lines (UT-SCC-2, UT-SCC-14, LK0412, LK0827, and LK0923) were selected for this study. The treatment sensitivity for radiation, cisplatin, cetuximab, and dasatinib was assessed by crystal violet assay. Gene expression of EMT and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers as well as protein level of EGFR signaling molecules were analyzed by qPCR and western blotting, respectively. Unlike UT-SCC-14 and LK0827, the LK0412 cell line became significantly more sensitive to cetuximab in hypoxic conditions. This cetuximab sensitivity was efficiently reversed after suppression of HIF-1 alpha with siRNA. Additionally, hypoxia-induced EMT and expression of stem cell markers in HNSCC cells was partially revoked by treatment with cetuximab or knockdown of HIF-1 alpha. In summary, our study shows that hypoxia might have a positive influence on the anti-EGFR therapy effectiveness in HNSCC. However, due to heterogeneity of HNSCC lesions, targeting HIF-1 alpha may not be sufficient to mediate such a response. Further studies identifying a trait of hypoxia-specific response to cetuximab in HNSCC are advisable.

Generated cells were frozen in 209 vials and designated as mesenchymal stromal cell bank. These vials served as a source for generation of clinical grade mesenchymal stromal cell end-products, which exhibited typical mesenchymal stromal cell phenotype, trilineage differentiation potential and at later passages expressed replicative senescence-related markers (p21 and p16). Genetic analysis demonstrated their genomic stability (normal karyotype and a diploid pattern). Importantly, clinical end-products exerted a significantly higher allosuppressive potential than the mean allosuppressive potential of mesenchymal stromal cells generated from the same donors individually. Administration of 81 mesenchymal stromal cell end-products to 26 patients with severe steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease in 7 stem cell transplant centers who were refractory to many lines of treatment, induced a 77% overall response at the primary end point (day 28). Remarkably, although the cohort of patients was highly challenging (96% grade III/IV and only 4% grade II graft-versus-host disease), after treatment with mesenchymal stromal cell end-products the overall survival rate at two years follow up was 71 +/- 11% for the entire patient cohort, compared to 51.4 +/- 9.0% in graft-versus-host disease clinical studies, in which mesenchymal stromal cells were derived from single donors. Mesenchymal stromal cell end-products may, therefore, provide a novel therapeutic tool for the effective treatment of severe acute graft-versus-host disease.

Molecular Heterogeneity in a Patient-Derived Glioblastoma Xenoline Is Regulated by Different Cancer Stem Cell Populations	PLOS ONE												Malignant glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with a dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Genomic profiling of GBM samples has identified four molecular subtypes (Proneural, Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal), which may arise from different glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) populations. We previously showed that adherent cultures of GSCs grown on laminin-coated plates (Ad-GSCs) and spheroid cultures of GSCs (Sp-GSCs) had high expression of stem cell markers (CD133, Sox2 and Nestin), but low expression of differentiation markers (beta III-tubulin and glial fibrillary acid protein). In the present study, we characterized GBM tumors produced by subcutaneous and intracranial injection of Ad-GSCs and Sp-GSCs isolated from a patient-derived xenoline. Although they formed tumors with identical histological features, gene expression analysis revealed that xenografts of Sp-GSCs had a Classical molecular subtype similar to that of bulk tumor cells. In contrast xenografts of Ad-GSCs expressed a Mesenchymal gene signature. Adherent GSC-derived xenografts had high STAT3 and ANGPTL4 expression, and enrichment for stem cell markers, transcriptional networks and pro-angiogenic markers characteristic of the Mesenchymal subtype. Examination of clinical samples from GBM patients showed that STAT3 expression was directly correlated with ANGPTL4 expression, and that increased expression of these genes correlated with poor patient survival and performance. A pharmacological STAT3 inhibitor abrogated STAT3 binding to the ANGPTL4 promoter and exhibited anticancer activity in vivo. Therefore, Ad-GSCs and Sp-GSCs produced histologically identical tumors with different gene expression patterns, and a STAT3/ANGPTL4 pathway is identified in glioblastoma that may serve as a target for therapeutic intervention.

However, selection of an ideal cell source, which can be readily differentiated into AF cells of various regions, remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of AF tissue. In this study, we set out to explore the feasibility of using transforming growth factor-3-mediated bone marrow stem cells (tBMSCs) for AF tissue engineering. Since the differentiation of stem cells significantly relies on the stiffness of substrate, we fabricated nanofibrous scaffolds from a series of biodegradable poly(ether carbonate urethane)-urea (PECUU) materials whose elastic modulus approximated that of native AF tissue. We cultured tBMSCs on PECUU scaffolds and compared their gene expression profile to AF-derived stem cells (AFSCs), the newly identified AF tissue-specific stem cells. As predicted, the expression of collagen-I in both tBMSCs and AFSCs increased with scaffold stiffness, whereas the expression of collagen-II and aggrecan genes showed an opposite trend. Interestingly, the expression of collagen-I, collagen-II and aggrecan genes in tBMSCs on PECUU scaffolds were consistently higher than those in AFSCs regardless of scaffold stiffness. In addition, the cell traction forces (CTFs) of both tBMSCs and AFSCs gradually decreased with scaffold stiffness, which is similar to the CTF change of cells from inner to outer regions of native AF tissue. Together, findings from this study indicate that tBMSCs had strong tendency to differentiate into various types of AF cells and presented gene expression profiles similar to AFSCs, thereby establishing a rationale for the use of tBMSCs in AF tissue engineering.

Besides prototypical ASCL1 PN target genes, the molecular effectors mediating ASCL1 function in regulating GBM differentiation and, most relevantly, subgroup specification are currently unknown. Here we report that ASCL1 not only promotes the acquisition of a PN phenotype in CSCs by inducing a glial-to-neuronal lineage switch but also concomitantly represses mesenchymal (MES) features by directly downregulating the expression of N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), which we propose as a novel gene classifier of MES GBMs. Increasing the expression of ASCL1 in PN CSCs results in suppression of self-renewal, promotion of differentiation and, most significantly, decrease in tumorigenesis, which is also reproduced by NDRG1 silencing. Conversely, both abrogation of ASCL1 expression in PN CSCs and enforcement of NDRG1 expression in either PN or MES CSCs induce proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) and enhanced mesenchymal features. Surprisingly, ASCL1 overexpression in MES CSCs increases malignant features and gives rise to a neuroendocrine-like secretory phenotype. Altogether, our results propose that the fine interplay between ASCL1 and its target NDRG1 might serve as potential subgroup-specific targetable vulnerability in GBM; enhancing ASCL1 expression in PN GBMs might reduce tumorigenesis, whereas repressing NDRG1 expression might be actionable to hamper the malignancy of GBM belonging to the MES subgroup.				mortini, pietro/AAB-1292-2019; Molinari, Agnese/AAC-2918-2021; Politi, Letterio/AAB-1092-2021; Molinari, Agnese/E-7588-2015; Fagnocchi, Luca/M-2715-2017; Bozzuto, Giuseppina/E-9094-2015; Galli, Rossella/AAI-8028-2020; Pala, Mauro/AAY-4774-2020; Gallotti, Alberto/AAN-2193-2020; Zordan, Paola/AAN-1963-2020; PADUA, Rose Ann/E-8621-2019; CASTELLANO, Antonella/I-3973-2018	Molinari, Agnese/0000-0002-9592-5465; Politi, Letterio/0000-0002-6190-6688; Molinari, Agnese/0000-0002-9592-5465; Fagnocchi, Luca/0000-0002-9551-5474; Bozzuto, Giuseppina/0000-0002-9761-3326; Galli, Rossella/0000-0001-9023-7033; Gallotti, Alberto/0000-0001-9698-7919; PADUA, Rose Ann/0000-0001-9964-7864; Pala, Mauro/0000-0002-3165-5291; Piras, Ignazio/0000-0003-4024-3368; Brugnara, Gianluca/0000-0003-2461-1407; Zordan, Paola/0000-0001-6915-5535; CASTELLANO, Antonella/0000-0002-4137-9016; Narayanan, Ashwin/0000-0002-2609-8881; MORTINI, Pietro/0000-0003-2320-2281; Altabella, Luisa/0000-0002-4816-6945												1350-9047	1476-5403				SEP	2019	26	9					1813	1831		10.1038/s41418-018-0248-7							WOS:000480648400018	30538287

However, the interactions between the scaffolds and cells should be optimally designed for their practical application. In this work, 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) pattern was functionalized by a polydopamine (PDA) interlayer to firmly bond the halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) on the surfaces of the PLA pattern for guiding cell orientation. A series of 3D printed PLA patterns with different stripe widths were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polarized light microscopy (POM), 3D optical profiler and so on. The successful introduction of HNTs on PLA pattern was verified by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle (WCA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The HNTs coating could effectively improve roughness and hydrophilicity of PLA pattern. In addition, in vitro human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) culture experiments suggested that 3D printed PLA patterns with different strip widths exhibited different ability to induce cell orientation. The smaller the stripe width of the PLA pattern, the more suitable for cell orientation. When the layer height was set to 0.05 mm, the effect of inducing cell orientation was optimal. Meanwhile, the 3D printed PLA pattern with HNTs coating was more suitable for the adhesion and proliferation of cells. This works provides a general routine for improving the cell affinity of 3D printed PLA structure by the simple coating of nanoparticles, which shows the promising application in cell culture scaffolds, wound healing materials, and biosensors.

Biomechanical and Elastographic Analysis of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Treated Tissue Following Surgery	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME												Hernia repair continues to be a problem facing surgeons today particularly because of the high incidence of reoccurrence. This work presents preliminary data of a pioneering effort to investigate the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on mechanical property enhancement in full thickness fascial defects. Heparinized MSCs harvested from a rabbit's tibia/iliac crest were applied to two fascial defects on the rabbit's abdominal wall, with two other defects acting as controls (no MSCs added). After an 8 week recovery period, the entire abdominal fascia was harvested for mechanical property testing and elastographic strain analysis. Preliminary results from uniaxial tensile testing indicate a significant increase in the modulus of toughness strain energy, with at least a 50% increase in the MSC treated defects as compared with the control defects. Results from the elastographic strain analysis show excellent correlation in the calibration of the elastography to the uniaxial tensile test, with nearly identical moduli of elasticity In addition, the elastographs clearly show tissue property heterogeneity at all stages of tensile testing. The MSC treated tissue demonstrates promise of enhanced material properties over that of the nontreated tissue; testing and analysis is ongoing. The etastography provides pixel-level description of tissue property variations providing critical information on wound healing effectiveness that would be impossible with other methods. In the ongoing research, optical elastography, in combination with the traditional tensile test and tissue histology, will be used to characterize localized biomechanical properties directly within the defect area and to locate "crack" initiation and propagation sights as the material is strained to rupture.

However, the heterogeneity of MSCs, whether inherent or developed during culture expansion, has a significant impact on their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the ability to identify and select an efficacious subpopulation of MSCs targeting specific tissue damage or disease holds great clinical significance. In this study, we separated three subpopulations from culture expanded human bone marrow derived MSCs according to cell size, using a high-throughput label-free microfluidic cell sorting technology. The size-sorted MSC subpopulations varied in tri-lineage differentiation potencies. The large MSCs showed the strongest osteogenesis, medium-size MSCs were advantageous in chondrogenesis and adipogenesis, and the small MSCs showed the weakest tri-lineage differentiation. The size-sorted MSC subpopulations also exhibited different secretome profiles. The large MSC secretome possessed highest levels of osteogenic promotor proteins and senescence-associated factors, but lower levels of osteogenic inhibitor proteins compared to the medium-size MSC secretome. The medium-size MSC secretome had high levels of chondrogenic promotor proteins, and contained lower levels of chondrogenic inhibitor proteins compared to the large MSC secretome. The secretome of size-sorted MSC subpopulations showed differences in paracrine effects. We found that the secretome of large MSCs enhanced osteogenic and adipogenic potencies during MSC culture expansion, but also induced cell senescence; and the secretome of medium-size MSCs promoted chondrogenesis. This study demonstrates size-dependent differentiation potency and secretome profile of MSC subpopulations, and provides an effective and practical technology to isolate the respective subpopulations, which may be used for more targeted tissue repair and regeneration.

If a single cancer cell can give rise to progenies, which can be passaged sustainably in vitro and produce tumor in xenotransplantation, the cell should be cancer initiating cell. CD133 (Prominin-1, Prom1) is the marker of human colorectal cancer (CRC) stem cells and probably a marker of metastatic cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thirty-three SCPs of CRC cell line SW480 were isolated by limited dilution methods, thirty of which are CD133 positive and three negative. All of the CD133(+) SCPs are tumorigenic, and the subcutaneous tumors expanded rapidly, while only 1 of 3 CD133(-) SCPs developed a minimal tumor in nude mice. Orthotopic transplantation experiments showed that CD133(+) SCPs possessed heterogeneity in intestinal wall invasion, lymph node and liver metastases. CD133(+) SCPs varied in cell growth, invasive ability, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and expression of CSCs markers (CD133, CD44, and CXCR4) associated with metastatic potential. CD133(-) SCPs did not produce secondary transplanted tumor, intestinal invasion and metastasis. The results indicated CD133(+) subpopulation of SW480 SCPs bear heterogeneous invasive and metastatic ability, and CRC-CSCs might be a heterogeous subpopulation.

De novo generation of white adipocytes from the myeloid lineage via mesenchymal intermediates is age, adipose depot, and gender specific	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												It is generally assumed that white adipocytes arise from resident adipose tissue mesenchymal progenitor cells. We challenge this paradigm by defining a hematopoietic origin for both the de novo development of a subset of white adipocytes in adults and a previously uncharacterized adipose tissue resident mesenchymal progenitor population. Lineage and cytogenetic analysis revealed that bone marrow progenitor (BMP)-derived adipocytes and adipocyte progenitors arise from hematopoietic cells via the myeloid lineage in the absence of cell fusion. Global gene expression analysis indicated that the BMP-derived fat cells are bona fide adipocytes but differ from conventional white or brown adipocytes in decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid oxidation, and increased inflammatory gene expression. The BMP-derived adipocytes accumulate with age, occur in higher numbers in visceral than in subcutaneous fat, and in female versus male mice. BMP-derived adipocytes may, therefore, account in part for adipose depot heterogeneity and detrimental changes in adipose metabolism and inflammation with aging and adiposity.																	0027-8424					AUG 17	2010	107	33					14781	14786		10.1073/pnas.1003512107							WOS:000281287600048	20679227

Thus, high-efficient preparation and systematic dissection of the signatures and biofunctions of the subpopulation is the prerequisite for large-scale clinical applications. Materials and methods We primarily took advantage of a cytokine-based programming strategy for large-scale VCAM-1(+)hUC-MSC generation (III-MSCs). Thereafter, we conducted multifaceted analyses including cytomorphology, immunophenotype, cell vitality, multilineage differentiation, whole-genome analysis, tube formation and Matrigel plug assay, lymphocyte activation and differentiation, and systemic transplantation for aplastic anaemia (AA) treatment. Results III-MSCs with high-proportioned VCAM-1 expression were obtained by combining IL-1 beta, IL-4 with IFN-gamma, which exhibited comparable immunophenotype with untreated hUC-MSCs (NT-MSCs) but revealed multidimensional superiorities both at the cellular and molecular levels. Simultaneously, systemic infusion of III-MSCs could significantly ameliorate clinicopathological features and finally help facilitate haematopoietic reconstruction and immunoregulation in AA mice. Conclusions We have established a high-efficient procedure for large-scale generation of III-MSCs with preferable signatures and efficacy upon aplastic anaemia in mice. Our findings suggested that III-MSCs were advantageous sources with multifaceted characteristics for regenerative medicine.

Therapeutic use of MSCs usually requires culture expansion, which increases the heterogeneity of MSCs in vitro, thus affecting the potency of the MSCs for more specific indications. The capacity for identifying and isolating special subsets of MSCs for treatment of specific diseases therefore holds great clinical significance. An important therapeutic application of MSC is for the regeneration of cartilage tissue. We and others have previously developed label-free microfluidic means to isolate subpopulations of culture expanded MSCs based on distinct biophysical characteristics. Here we utilize a spiral micro-channel device to separate culture expanded MSCs into five subgroups according to cell size, and study their proliferation and chondrogenesis at early, middle and late passages. Results show that in all passages, the medium-size subpopulation (cell size of 17-21 m), compared to other subpopulations, displays significantly higher proliferation rate and chondrogenic capacity in terms of cartilage extracellular matrix formation. Also, the small cell subpopulation (average cell size of 11-12 m) shows lower viability, and large cell subpopulation (average cell size 23-25 m) expresses higher level of senescence-associated -galactosidase. Finally, we show that repeated microfluidic exclusion of MSCs larger than 21 m and smaller than 17 m at every passage during continuous culture expansion result in selected MSCs with faster proliferation and better chondrogenic potential as compared to MSC derived from conventional expansion approach. This study demonstrates the significant merit and utility of size-based cell selection for the application of MSCs in cartilage regeneration.

Clarifying and defining heterogeneities in vitro among perivascular cells could lead to improved cell-based tissue regeneration strategies and a better understanding of human developmental processes. We studied contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), synthetic vSMCs, and pericytes derived from a common human pluripotent stem cell source. Using in vitro cultures, we show unique cell morphology, subcellular organelle organization (namely endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and stress fibers), and expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and elastin for each cell type. While differences in extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling were less pronounced, the multipotency, in vivo, migratory, invasion, and contractile functionalities are distinctive for each cell type. Overall, we define a repertoire of functional phenotypes in vitro specific for each of the human perivascular cell types, enabling their study and use in basic and translational research.																	2213-6711					MAY 6	2014	2	5					561	575		10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.03.004							WOS:000336649600001	24936446

Based on the differential responsiveness to a Sox2 reporter, SRR2, we had found a novel dichotomy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, with reporter-responsive (RR) cells showing more CSC-like features than reporter-unresponsive (RU) cells. Specifically, RR cells exhibited significantly higher tumorsphere formation capacity, proportions of CD44(High) cells, chemoresistance to cisplatin, and tumorigenic potential in vivo. H2O2, a potent inducer of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, was found to induce a conversion from RU to RR cells; importantly, converted RR cells acquired CSC-like features. The PI3K/AKT/c-MYC signalling axis is important in this context, since pharmacologic blockade of PI3K-AKT or siRNA knockdown of c-MYC effectively inhibited the RR phenotype and its associated CSC-like features, as well as the H2O2-induced RU/RR conversion. In a cohort of 188 ESCC patient samples, we found a significant correlation between strong c-MYC expression and a short overall survival (p = .009). In conclusion, we have described a novel intratumoral heterogeneity in ESCC. The identification of the PI3K/AKT/c-MYC axis as a driver of CSC-like features carries therapeutic implications.

Despite the common criteria of characterization, many factors contribute to MSC heterogeneity (i.e., tissue origin, coexistence of cell subsets at different stage of differentiation, epigenetic) and no standard methods have been approved to characterize MSCs in cell culture. Aim: The present study aimed to test whether MSCs resist adverse chemical and physical culture conditions, surviving MSC subpopulations are endowed with the stemness abilities; to characterize MMP expression in AAA-MSCs under the adverse experimental conditions. Methods and Results: MSCs enzymatically isolated from human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA-MSCs) were exposed to media acidification, hypoxia, starving, drying and hypothermia through the following strategies: (1) low-density seeding in closed flasks; (2) exposure to a chemical hypoxia inducer, cobalt chloride; (3) exposure to a dry environment with growing medium deprivation and culture at 4 degrees C. None of these conditions affected MSC viability and stemness profile, as evidenced by NANOG, OCT-4, and SOX-2 mRNA expression in surviving cells. A significant MMP-9 decrease, especially when AAA-MSCs were exposed to hypothermia, was associated with stress resistant stem cells. Conclusions: AAA-MSCs survive to extremely adverse culture conditions, keeping their morphology and stemness features. Besides MMP-9 role in pathological tissue remodeling, this protease may be related to MSC survival. Future studies on MSCs derived from other tissues will be necessary to refine our culture protocol, which can represent an empirical method to demonstrate MSC stemness, with potential implications for their clinical use.				fittipaldi, silvia/K-8628-2016; Gallitto, E./K-6771-2016; Vasuri, Francesco/K-5418-2016; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea/I-7088-2012	fittipaldi, silvia/0000-0002-3463-1367; Gallitto, E./0000-0002-5081-9909; Vasuri, Francesco/0000-0002-1145-6025; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea/0000-0003-1506-1829												2296-634X					JUN 4	2015	3								36	10.3389/fcell.2015.00036							WOS:000595414900001	26090364

While the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of MSCs stemming from their developmental origins has been acknowledged, the genetic and environmental factors underpinning these differences are not well-understood. Here, we investigated whether substrate stiffness mediated mechanical cues can directly modulate the development of ectodermal MSCs (eMSCs) from a precursor human neural crest stem cell (NCSC) population. We showed that NCSC-derived eMSCs were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from mesodermal bone marrow MSCs. eMSCs derived on lower substrate stiffness specifically increased their expression of the MSC marker, CD44 in a Rho-ROCK signaling dependent manner, which resulted in a concomitant increase in the eMSCs' adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential. This mechanically-induced effect can only be maintained for short-term upon switching back to a stiff substrate but can be sustained for longer-term when the eMSCs were exclusively maintained on soft substrates. We also discovered that CD44 expression modulated eMSC self-renewal and multipotency via the downregulation of downstream platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) signaling. This is the first instance demonstrating that substrate stiffness not only influences the differentiation trajectories of MSCs but also their derivation from upstream progenitors, such as NCSCs.

F.			Distinct skeletal stem cell types orchestrate long bone skeletogenesis	ELIFE												Skeletal stem and progenitor cell populations are crucial for bone physiology. Characterization of these cell types remains restricted to heterogenous bulk populations with limited information on whether they are unique or overlap with previously characterized cell types. Here we show, through comprehensive functional and single-cell transcriptomic analyses, that postnatal long bones of mice contain at least two types of bone progenitors with bona fide skeletal stem cell (SSC) characteristics. An early osteochondral SSC (ocSSC) facilitates long bone growth and repair, while a second type, a perivascular SSC (pvSSC), co-emerges with long bone marrow and contributes to shape the hematopoietic stem cell niche and regenerative demand. We establish that pvSSCs, but not ocSSCs, are the origin of bone marrow adipose tissue. Lastly, we also provide insight into residual SSC heterogeneity as well as potential crosstalk between the two spatially distinct cell populations. These findings comprehensively address previously unappreciated shortcomings of SSC research.

Cancer stem cell-driven efficacy of trastuzumab (Herceptin): towards a reclassification of clinically HER2-positive breast carcinomas	ONCOTARGET												Clinically HER2+ (cHER2+) breast cancer (BC) can no longer be considered a single BC disease entity in terms of trastuzumab responsiveness. Here we propose a framework for predicting the response of cHER2+ to trastuzumab that integrates the molecular distinctions of intrinsic BC subtypes with recent knowledge on cancer stem cell (CSC) biology. First, we consider that two interchangeable populations of epithelial-like, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-expressing and mesenchymallike, CD44+ CD24(-/low) CSCs can be found in significantly different proportions across all intrinsic BC subtypes. Second, we overlap all the intrinsic subtypes across cHER2+ BC to obtain a continuum of mixed phenotypes in which one extreme exhibits a high identity with ALDH+ CSCs and the other extreme exhibits a high preponderance of CD44+ CD24(-/low) CSCs. The differential enrichment of trastuzumab-responsive ALDH+ CSCs versus trastuzumab-refractory CD44+ CD24(-/low) CSCs can explain both the clinical behavior and the primary efficacy of trastuzumab in each molecular subtype of cHER2+ (i.e., HER2-enriched/cHER2+, luminal A/cHER2+, luminal B/cHER2+, basal/ cHER2+, and claudin-low/cHER2+). The intrinsic plasticity determining the epigenetic ability of cHER2+ tumors to switch between epithelial and mesenchymal CSC states will vary across the continuum of mixed phenotypes, thus dictating their intratumoral heterogeneity and, hence, their evolutionary response to trastuzumab. Because CD44+ CD24(-/low) mesenchymal-like CSCs distinctively possess a highly endocytic activity, the otherwise irrelevant HER2 can open the door to a type of "Trojan horse" approach by employing antibody-drug conjugates such as T-DM1, which will allow a rapid and CSC-targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs to therapeutically manage trastuzumabunresponsive basal/cHER2+ BC. Contrary to the current dichotomous model used clinically, our model proposes that a reclassification of cHER2+ tumors based on the spectrum of molecular BC subtypes might inform on their CSC-determined sensitivity to trastuzumab, thus providing a better delineation of the predictive value of cHER2+ in BC by incorporating CSCs-driven intra-tumor heterogeneity into clinical decisions.

It is known that mouse ESCs are dynamic heterogeneous populations. However, it remains largely unclear whether and how EpiSCs possess heterogeneity and plasticity similar to that of ESCs. Here, we show that EpiSCs are discriminated by the expression of a specific marker '1' (Brachyury) into two populations. The T -positive (T+) and the T-negative (T-) populations can be interconverted within the same culture condition. In addition, the two populations display distinct responses to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and different developmental potentials. The T- EpiSCs are preferentially differentiated into ectoderm lineages, whereas EpiSCs have a biased potential for mesendoderm fates. Mechanistic studies reveal that T+ EpiSCs have an earlier and faster response to BMP4 stimulation than T- EpiSCs. Idl mediates the commitment of T- EpiSCs to epidermal lineage during BMP4 treatment. On the other hand, Snail modulates the conversion of T+ EpiSCs to mesendoderm fates with the presence of BMP4. Furthermore, T expression is essential for epithelialmesenchymal transition during EpiSCs differentiation. Our findings suggest that the dynamic heterogeneity of the T+ /T-subpopulation primes EpiSCs toward particular cell lineages, providing important insights into the dynamic development of the early mouse embryo.

Many biofabrication and micropatterning technologies are developed to achieve this goal. However, the critical outstanding challenges are the capabilities to spatially control the micropatterns and to decouple the different niche factors. Multiphoton microfabrication is an emerging technology with unique advantages. A multiphoton 3D microprinting platform has been previously established to create protein microstructures and micropatterns with sub-micrometer resolution and its ability to control the topological features, porosity, and mechanical properties of microprinted protein cell niche has been demonstrated. Here, it is demonstrated that the multiphoton microprinting technology is able to precisely control the local density of the matrix niche factor, and more importantly, spatially control and decouple the mechanical and matrix niche factors. The results show that 1) the micropatterned matrix niche retains its bioactivities; 2) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are able to sense the elastic modulus of the cell niche when the mechanical and matrix niche factors are decoupled; and 3) MSCs prefer to bind to and spread on fibronectin among other matrix proteins. These results path the way to future development of a "programmable" cell niche platform.

However, treatments for AF repair/regeneration remain challenging due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of AF tissue at cellular, biochemical, and biomechanical levels. In this study, we isolated and characterized a sub-population of cells from rabbit AF tissue which formed colonies in vitro and could self-renew. These cells showed gene expression of typical surface antigen molecules characterizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including CD29, CD44, and CD166. Meanwhile, they did not express negative markers of MSCs such as CD4, CD8, and CD14. They also expressed Oct-4, nucleostemin, and SSEA-4 proteins. Upon induced differentiation they showed typical osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis potential. Together, these AF-derived colony-forming cells possessed clonogenicity, self-renewal, and multipotential differentiation capability, the three criteria characterizing MSCs. Such AF-derived stem cells may potentially be an ideal candidate for DDD treatments using cell therapies or tissue engineering approaches.

However, the characteristics of ASCs from different types of adipose tissue have varying biochemical and functional properties. We aimed to investigate how age affected the biological and functional characteristics of ASCs from brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). ASCs were obtained and cultured from mouse BAT and WAT at different ages: young (2 months of age) and older mice (22 months of age). Mesenchymal markers were characterized by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation potential, senescence, and metabolism were then determined. The percentage of WAT was higher in elderly mice, and the percentage of BAT was higher in young mice. All ASC sample phenotypes were characterized as CD29+/CD44+/CD105+/CD45-; the proliferation rate was not statistically different among all age groups. However, the number of senescent cells and the percentage of apoptosis in elderly mouse ASCs were significantly increased, and the ability of osteogenic and lipogenic differentiation was decreased in these same animals. In addition, ASCs from young mice were more inclined to undergo osteogenic differentiation, especially BAT-ASCs, whose gene expression of fat-consuming components was also significantly higher than of WAT-ASCs. The results indicated that ASCs derived from both WAT and BAT possessed different characteristics of fat metabolism and cell differentiation relative to the osteo- and adipolineages. In particular, because BAT-ASCs from young mice contributed to fat consumption, if used for cell grafting, they may potentially be attractive vehicles for treating obesity.																	1422-6405	1422-6421				AUG	2020	209	1					26	36		10.1159/000507434							WOS:000604339200003	32526740

Adaptation of a Simple Microfluidic Platform for High-Dimensional Quantitative Morphological Analysis of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells on Polystyrene-Based Substrates	SLAS TECHNOLOGY												Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs, often called mesenchymal stem cells) have garnered significant attention within the field of regenerative medicine because of their purported ability to differentiate down musculoskeletal lineages. Given the inherent heterogeneity of MSC populations, recent studies have suggested that cell morphology may be indicative of MSC differentiation potential. Toward improving current methods and developing simple yet effective approaches for the morphological evaluation of MSCs, we combined passive pumping microfluidic technology with high-dimensional morphological characterization to produce robust tools for standardized high-throughput analysis. Using ultraviolet (UV) light as a modality for reproducible polystyrene substrate modification, we show that MSCs seeded on microfluidic straight channel devices incorporating UV-exposed substrates exhibited morphological changes that responded accordingly to the degree of substrate modification. Substrate modification also effected greater morphological changes in MSCs seeded at a lower rather than higher density within microfluidic channels. Despite largely comparable trends in morphology, MSCs seeded in microscale as opposed to traditional macroscale platforms displayed much higher sensitivity to changes in substrate properties. In summary, we adapted and qualified microfluidic cell culture platforms comprising simple straight channel arrays as a viable and robust tool for high-throughput quantitative morphological analysis to study cell-material interactions.

Phenotypic differences during the osteogenic differentiation of single cell-derived clones isolated from human lipoaspirates	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE												Osteogenic precursors can be obtained from mesenchymal stem cells, which can be isolated from different sources, including adipose tissue. Optimal osteogenic differentiation in in vitro conditions and the selection of the potential precursors that could be further used in bone regeneration still have two main questions left to solve, viz. the heterogeneity of the mesenchymal cell population and the presence of a basal transcription level of several characteristic genes of the osteogenic lineage, which makes rapid and effective comparisons during cell differentiation difficult. Single-cell clones were isolated and expanded from human lipoaspirate cells. Osteogenic differentiation was induced and studied in defined media, using four representative isolated cell clones showing differences in the basal expression of a set of characteristic osteogenic genes. The clones showing a low constitutive expression of these genes were able to display comparatively higher levels of mineralization. In addition, the cells from these clones displayed a characteristic pattern of bundle fibres of collagen during osteogenic induction and showed a higher potency to differentiate towards the adipogenic lineage. These results demonstrate that specific multipotent precursors can be isolated from human lipoaspirate cells with a higher differentiation potential, allowing the maturation of specific lineages in a shorter time. These results additionally demonstrate that, since the basal expressions of the several genes were used as osteogenic markers, a phenotypic biochemical analysis should always be utilized to study optimal osteogenesis conditions.

These tumors are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous with transcriptome subtypespecific GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) that adapt to the brain tumor microenvironment, including hypoxic niches. We identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha-antisense RNA 2 (HIF1A-AS2) as a subtypespecific hypoxia-inducible lncRNA, upregulated in mesenchymal GSCs. Its deregulation affects GSC growth, self-renewal, and hypoxia-dependent molecular reprogramming. Among the HIF1A-AS2 interactome, IGF2BP2 and DHX9 were identified as direct partners. This association was needed for maintenance of expression of their target gene, HMGA1. Downregulation of HIF1A-AS2 led to delayed growth of mesenchymal GSC tumors, survival benefits, and impaired expression of HMGA1 in vivo. Our data demonstrate that HIF1A-AS2 contributes to GSCs' speciation and adaptation to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment, acting directly through its interactome and targets and indirectly by modulating responses to hypoxic stress depending on the subtype- specific genetic context.

Growing evidence indicates that the CSC phenotypes are related to the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we report that the gradient of mechanical stresses guides the spatial patterning of the expression of CD44 and Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the geometrically confined multicellular sheets. Our study shows that the cytoskeletal contraction regulates the expression of CD44 through the translocation of YAP into the nucleus. The results demonstrate that geometric confinement and mechanical stresses are the regulators in the spatial patterning of CSC.

Methods There were three groups: A: in-vitro prefabrication flaps of endothelial cells (ECs)-red fluorescence protein (RFP) + in-vivo prefabrication via arterial-venous tracts (AVT) (ECs-RFP-AVT), B: in-vitro prefabrication flaps of ECs-RFP, and C: in-vivo prefabrication flaps of AVT. Results: BM-MSCs-derived ECs were identified. The in-vitro prefabrication assay showed that the positive expression of CD31 in ECs-RFP was increased with time and reached the peak at the day 10; the positive expression of CD31 was significantly higher than that in BM-MSCs at each time point. The in-vivo prefabrication assay revealed that the positive expressions of CD31 in the three groups were increased over time, and it reached the peak at the day 14 in group A, but did peak even at day 21 in group B and C; the positive expression of CD31 in group A at each time point was significantly higher than those in groups B and C. Conclusion: BM-MSCs-induced ECs can show the vessel-like functions and BM-MSCs-derived ECs can be used as the vascular support structure of early transplanted flaps.																	2157-9083	2157-9091				SEP	2018	8	9					1296	1300		10.1166/jbt.2018.1873							WOS:000448343200009

To better understand how individual cells function within an anatomical space, we developed XYZeq, a workflow that encodes spatial metadata into scRNAseq libraries. We used XYZeq to profile mouse tumor models to capture spatially barcoded transcriptomes from tens of thousands of cells. Analyses of these data revealed the spatial distribution of distinct cell types and a cell migration-associated transcriptomic program in tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Furthermore, we identify localized expression of tumor suppressor genes by MSCs that vary with proximity to the tumor core. We demonstrate that XYZeq can be used to map the transcriptome and spatial localization of individual cells in situ to reveal how cell composition and cell states can be affected by location within complex pathological tissue.

Gene expression profiling classified glioblastoma (GBM) and GSCs into four transcriptomically-defined subtypes. Here, we determined the DNA methylation signatures in transcriptomically pre-classified GSC and GBM bulk tumors subtypes. We hypothesized that these DNA methylation signatures correlate with gene expression and are uniquely associated either with only GSCs or only GBM bulk tumors. Additional methylation signatures may be commonly associated with both GSCs and GBM bulk tumors, i.e., common to non-stem-like and stem-like tumor cell populations and correlating with the clinical prognosis of glioma patients. We analyzed Illumina 450K methylation array and expression data from a panel of 23 patient-derived GSCs. We referenced these results with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM datasets to generate methylomic and transcriptomic signatures for GSCs and GBM bulk tumors of each transcriptomically pre-defined tumor subtype. Survival analyses were carried out for these signature genes using publicly available datasets, including from TCGA. We report that DNA methylation signatures in proneural and mesenchymal tumor subtypes are either unique to GSCs, unique to GBM bulk tumors, or common to both. Further, dysregulated DNA methylation correlates with gene expression and clinical prognoses. Additionally, many previously identified transcriptionally-regulated markers are also dysregulated due to DNA methylation. The subtype-specific DNA methylation signatures described in this study could be useful for refining GBM sub-classification, improving prognostic accuracy, and making therapeutic decisions.

Dual Inhibition of MEK and AXL Targets Tumor Cell Heterogeneity and Prevents Resistant Outgrowth Mediated by the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in NSCLC	CANCER RESEARCH												The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic epigenetic reprogramming event that occurs in a subset of tumor cells and is an initiating step toward invasion and distant metastasis. The process is reversible and gives plasticity to cancer cells to survive under variable conditions, with the acquisition of cancer stem cell-like characteristics and features such as drug resistance. Therefore, understanding survival dependencies of cells along the phenotypic spectrum of EMT will provide better strategies to target the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of tumors and prevent their ability to bypass single-inhibitor treatment strategies. To address this, we integrated the data from a selective drug screen in epithelial and mesenchymal KRAS/p53 (KP)-mutant lung tumor cells with separate datasets including reverse-phase protein array and an in vivo shRNA dropout screen. These orthogonal approaches identified AXL andMEK as potential mesenchymal and epithelial cell survival dependencies, respectively. To capture the dynamicity of EMT, incorporation of a dual fluorescence EMT sensor system into murine KP lung cancer models enabled real-time analysis of the epigenetic state of tumor cells and assessment of the efficacy of single agent or combination treatment with AXL and MEK inhibitors. Both two- and three-dimensional culture systems and in vivo models revealed that this combination treatment strategy of MEK plus AXL inhibition synergistically killed lung cancer cells by specifically targeting each phenotypic subpopulation. In conclusion, these results indicate that cotargeting the specific vulnerabilities of EMT subpopulations can prevent EMT-mediated drug resistance, effectively controlling tumor cell growth and metastasis. Significance: This study shows that a novel combination ofMEK and AXL inhibitors effectively bypasses EMT-mediated drug resistance in KRAS/p53-mutant non-small cell lung cancer by targeting EMT subpopulations, thereby preventing tumor cell survival.

New tools to promote intercellular variability studies help elucidate cellular regulation mechanisms. Here an impedance measurement and analysis system was built to monitor the osteogenic differentiation of single bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in droplets. The biochip including a microelectrode array was designed based on droplet microfluidics and fabricated. A novel theoretical electrical model was proposed to simulate the electrical properties of cells in the droplets. Impedance measurements showed that single cells are substantially heterogeneous during osteoblast differentiation at different stages (days 0, 7, 14 and 21) and different cell passages (passages 6, 7 and 11). This result was consistent with the appearance of two biomarkers (alkaline phosphatase and calcium nodules), which are the gold standard biomarkers of osteoblastogenesis and differentiation. The device enabled highly efficient single-cell trapping, accurate positioning, and sensitive, label-free and noninvasive impedance measurements of individual cells with multiple channels. This system provides a strategy for exploring the processes of osteoblastogenesis and differentiation at the single-cell level and has substantial potential for applications in the biomedical field.

To identify novel regulators of EMT, we carried out cDNA screens that covered 500 human kinases. Subsequent characterization of candidate kinases led us to uncover cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) as a novel potent promoter for EMT and breast cancer progression. CDKL2-expressing human mammary gland epithelial cells displayed enhanced mesenchymal traits and stem cell-like phenotypes, which was acquired through activating a ZEB1/E-cadherin/beta-catenin positive feedback loop and regulating CD44 mRNA alternative splicing to promote conversion of CD24(high) cells to CD44(high) cells. Furthermore, CDKL2 enhanced primary tumor formation and metastasis in a breast cancer xenograft model. Notably, CDKL2 is expressed significantly higher in mesenchymal human breast cancer cell lines than in epithelial lines, and its over-expression/amplification in human breast cancers is associated with shorter disease-free survival. Taken together, our study uncovered a major role for CDKL2 in promoting EMT and breast cancer progression.

One of the more troubling features of this model is the high interindividual variability that is encountered and that requires a careful experimental design with sufficient sample size to make judgments valid. We have processed 241 individual preparations of rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) over the last 3 years and have kept detailed records of the performance of these cells in various assays. This communication details the lack of correlation between the analyzed parameters. Bone marrow was harvested from 4-month-old rabbits; the cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and cultured. When cells reached 80% of confluence, they were removed from the plates with trypsin and assayed for their osteo- and chondrogenic potential. The average yield of the 241 individual MPC preparations exhibited a coefficient of variation of 77. An in vivo implantation assay with porous calcium phosphate ceramic cubes exhibited scores with a coefficient of variation of 65. Lastly, an in vitro assay of alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity exhibited the most variability with a coefficient of variation of 132. All of the cell preparations tested in an in vitro aggregate culture assay underwent chondrogenic differentiation. No relationships between any of these parameters were found. The variability of the results within the different assays is interpreted to be the result of the heterogeneity of the preparations. The lack of correlation between the parameters studied shows the importance of the conditions intrinsic to the different assays. These results serve to emphasize that any experimental design involving rabbit, progenitor cells must include a sufficiently large sample size to allow statistically significant and rigorous conclusions.

TNBC cell lines and animal models provide effective tools for studies and drug discovery. Here, we report the development of two TNBC cell lines (XtMCF and LmMCF) based on our existing cell model that consists of normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10F, estradiol-transformed cells trMCF, and Boyden chamber-selected tumorigenic cells bsMCF. The XtMCF and LmMCF cell line were derived from xenograft and lung metastasis of bsMCF cells, respectively. The bsMCF, XtMCF, and LmMCF cells have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), exhibiting a mesenchymal-like feature. In vivo studies showed XtMCF and LmMCF cells were highly tumorigenic and metastatic. The injection of 5x10(4) cells to CB17/SCID mice mammary fat pad produced xenografts in 9/9 mice and tumors reached 10 millimeters in diameter in 5weeks. The injection of 1x10(6) XtMCF or 8x10(4) LmMCF cells into the mice tail vein was sufficient to form extensive lung metastases in 4weeks. The two new cell lines exhibited CD44(+)/CD49f(+) and CD44(+)/EpCAM(+) cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics, and the EGF-like domain of EpCAM was cleaved off. Together with the normal and early transformed counterparts, herein we provide a complete cancer model for the study of initiation, evolution, and identification of new therapeutics for TNBC. The finding that EGF-like domain of EpCAM was cleaved off in cells which have undergone EMT suggests this cleavage may be involved in the EMT process and the cancer stem cell properties of these cells.																	2045-7634					MAR	2016	5	3					558	573		10.1002/cam4.616							WOS:000373203000018	26775583

However, the use of SC in clinical cell-based therapy is hampered due to its limited availability. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of using an established induction protocol for human bone marrow derived-MSC (hBM-MSCs) transdifferentiation into a SC lineage. A relatively homogenous culture of hBM-MSCs was first established after serial passaging (P3), with profiles conforming to the minimal criteria set by International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT). The cultures (n = 3) were then subjected to a series of induction media containing beta-mercaptoethanol, retinoic acid, and growth factors. Quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry analyses were performed to quantify the expression of specific SC markers, that is, S100, GFAP, MPZ and p75 NGFR, in both undifferentiated and transdifferentiated hBM-MSCs. Based on these analyses, all markers were expressed in undifferentiated hBM-MSCs and MPZ expression (mRNA transcripts) was consistently detected before and after transdifferentiation across all samples. There was upregulation at the transcript level of more than twofolds for NGF, MPB, GDNF, p75 NGFR post-transdifferentiation. This study highlights the existence of spontaneous expression of specific SC markers in cultured hBM-MSCs, inter-donor variability and that MSC transdifferentiation is a heterogenous process. These findings strongly oppose the use of a single marker to indicate SC fate. The heterogenous nature of MSC may influence the efficiency of SC transdifferentiation protocols. Therefore, there is an urgent need to re-define the MSC subpopulations and revise the minimal criteria for MSC identification.

Soliciting Strategies for Developing Cell-Based Reference Materials to Advance Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Research and Clinical Translation	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT												The mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) field continues to rapidly progress with a number of clinical trials initiated and completed, with some reported successes in multiple clinical indications, and a growing number of companies established. The field, nevertheless, faces several challenges. Persistent issues include the definition of a MSC and comparability between MSC preparations. This is because of inherent cell heterogeneity, the absence of markers that are unique to MSCs, and the difficulty in precisely defining them by developmental origin. Differences in the properties of MSCs also depend on the site of tissue harvest, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the donor and the isolation, and storage and expansion methods used. These differences may be sufficient to ensure that attributes of the final MSC product could differ in potentially significant ways. Since there are currently no gold standards, we propose using a reference material to establish methods of comparability among MSC preparations. We suggest four possible "ruler scenarios'' and a method for global distribution. We further suggest that critical to establishing a reference material is the need to define protocols for comparing cells. The main purpose of this article is to solicit input in establishing a consensus-based comparison. A comparative approach will be critical to all stages of translation to better clarify mechanisms of MSC actions, define an optimal cell manufacturing process, ensure best practice clinical investigations, extend the use of an MSC product for new indications, protect an MSC product from imitators, and develop uniform reimbursement policies.

Whereas the majority of the adherent CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells were devoid of CD3/TCR alpha beta, most of the nonadherent CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells expressed this receptor complex. The adhesion of T cells to bone marrow stroma almost entirely was accounted for by CD49d and CD90, whereas that of adherent CD4(-)CD8 cells also was dependent on CD44, CD62L, and CD117 receptor. Blocking antibody combinations failed to reduce the adherence of these early T cells to less than 50% that of the control, On the other hand, the adhesion of unselected thymocytes to the stroma was reduced by 80%, using the same blocking antibodies. Therefore, the participation of additional molecules in the adhesion of early T cells to mesenchymal stroma is implicated. Comparison between the interaction of T cells with bone marrow mesenchymal or with thymus-derived epithelial stroma indicated that T cells utilize a selected set of adhesion molecules under each situation. Although CD49d and CD90 participated in both cases, CD11a, CD18, and CD2 receptors played a dominant role in the adhesion of T cells to thymic epithelium only, This study may point to a role of mesenchymal stroma in the regulation of early T-cell lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow.

The relapse of GBM following surgery, radiation, and systemic temozolomide (TMZ) is attributed to the ability of glioma stem cells (GSCs) to survive, evolve, and repopulate the tumor mass, events on which therapy exerts a poorly understood influence. Here we explore the molecular and cellular evolution of TMZ resistance as it emerges in vivo (xenograft models) in a series of human GSCs with either proneural (PN) or mesenchymal (MES) molecular characteristics. We observed that the initial response of GSC-initiated intracranial xenografts to TMZ is eventually replaced by refractory growth pattern. Individual tumors derived from the same isogenic GSC line expressed divergent and complex profiles of TMZ resistance markers, with a minor representation of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) upregulation. In several independent TMZ-resistant tumors originating from MES GSCs we observed a consistent diminution of mesenchymal features, which persisted in cell culture and correlated with increased expression of Nestin, decline in transglutaminase 2 and sensitivity to radiation. The corresponding mRNA expression profiles reflective of TMZ resistance and stem cell phenotype were recapitulated in the transcriptome of exosome-like extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by GSCs into the culture medium. Intrinsic changes in the tumor-initiating cell compartment may include loss of subtype characteristics and reciprocal alterations in sensitivity to chemo- and radiation therapy. These observations suggest that exploiting therapy-induced changes in the GSC phenotype and alternating cycles of therapy may be explored to improve GBM outcomes.

Antibodies against several GSLs designated as stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEAs), have been widely used to characterize differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. In view of the cross-reactivities of these antibodies with multiple glycans, a few laboratories have employed advanced mass spectrometry (MS) technologies to define the dynamic changes of surface GSLs upon ES differentiation. However, the amphiphilic nature and heterogeneity of GSLs make them difficult to decipher. In our studies, systematic survey of GSL expression profiles in human ES cells and differentiated derivatives was conducted, primarily with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS (MALDI-MS) and MS/MS analyses. In addition to the well-known ES-specific markers, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, several previously undisclosed globo- and lacto-series GSLs, including Gb4Cer, Lc4Cer, fucosyl Lc4Cer, Globo H, and disialyl Gb5Cer were identified in the undifferentiated human ES and induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, during differentiation to embryoid body outgrowth, the core structures of GSLs switched from globo- and lacto- to ganglio-series. Lineage-specific differentiation was also marked by alterations of specific GSLs. During differentiation into neural progenitors, core structures shifted to primarily ganglio-series dominated by GD3. GSL patterns shifted to prominent expression of Gb4Cer with little SSEA-3 and- 4 or GD3 during endodermal differentiation. Several issues relevant to MS analysis and novel GSLs in ES cells were discussed. Finally, unique GSL signatures in ES and cancer cells are exploited in glycan-targeted anti-cancer immunotherapy and their mechanistic investigations were discussed using anti-GD2 mAb and Globo H as examples.				yu, john/AAA-9255-2021	Yu, John/0000-0002-3237-4272; yu, alice/0000-0003-2444-0505												0282-0080	1573-4986				DEC	2017	34	6			SI		765	777		10.1007/s10719-016-9715-x							WOS:000416855700009	27549315

There are rare stem cells within the leukemic population that possess extensive proliferation and self-renewal capacity not found in the majority of the leukemic cells. These leukemic stem cells are necessary and sufficient to maintain the leukemia. While the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of CML was first suggested over 30 years ago, recently CML-initiating cells beyond HSCs are also being investigated. We have previously isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1(+)) cells carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene from the bone marrow of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) patients with hemangioblast property. Here, we showed that CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-)MSCs had normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype but appeared impaired in immuno-modulatory function. The capacity of patient Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-)MSCs to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. CML patient-derived MSCs have impaired immuno-modulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response may originate from MSCs rather than HSCs. MSCs might be a potential target for developing efficacious cures for CML.																	1756-9966					MAY 2	2011	30								47	10.1186/1756-9966-30-47							WOS:000290684100001	21535879

Preclinical data suggest that current breast cancer treatment strategies lead to CSC enrichment, contributing to chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance, although a strong correlation with clinical parameters and prognosis is yet to be established. Importantly, overcoming treatment failure by effective targeting of CSCs may be an appealing approach, potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Several preclinical studies provide promising results that support this hypothesis. The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of CSCs in breast cancer recurrence and resistance and to discuss current attempts of CSC targeting.

Targeting glioma stem cells through combined BMI1 and EZH2 inhibition	NATURE MEDICINE												Glioblastomas are lethal cancers defined by angiogenesis and pseudopalisading necrosis. Here, we demonstrate that these histological features are associated with distinct transcriptional programs, with vascular regions showing a proneural profile, and hypoxic regions showing a mesenchymal pattern. As these regions harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted cellular survival under stress due to downregulation of the E3 ligase RNF144A. Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that proneural GSCs are preferentially sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas mesenchymal GSCs are more sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both proneural and mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be effective in overcoming therapy resistance caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.

Growth plate chondrocytes exhibit the ability of continuous proliferation and differentiation, which contributes to the continuous physiological growth. The growth plate has been hypothesized to contain SSCs which exhibit a desirable differentiation capacity to generate bone and cartilage. Due to the heterogeneity of the growth plate chondrocytes, SSCs in the growth plate are not well studied. The present study used cluster of differentiation (CD) 146 and CD105 as markers to isolate purified SSCs. CD105(+) SSCs and CD146(+) SSCs were isolated using a magnetic activated cell sorting method. To quantitatively investigate the proliferation and differentiation ability, the colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and multi-lineage differentiation capacity of CD105(+) SSCs and CD146(+) SSCs were compared with unsorted cells and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). It was revealed that CD105(+) and CD146(+) subpopulations represented subsets of SSCs which generated chondrocytes and osteocytes, however not adipocytes. Compared with CD105(+) subpopulations and ASCs, the CD146(+) subpopulation exhibited a greater CFE and continuous high chondrogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Therefore, the present study suggested that the CD146(+) subpopulation represented a chondrolineage-restricted subpopulation of SSCs and may therefore act as a valuable cell source for cartilage regeneration.

Isolation and Characterisation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Rat Bone Marrow and the Endosteal Niche: A Comparative Study	STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												Within bone, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist within the bone marrow stroma (BM-MSC) and the endosteal niche, as cells lining compact bone (CB-MSCs). This study isolated and characterised heterogeneous MSC populations from each niche and subsequently investigated the effects of extensive cell expansion, analysing population doublings (PDs)/cellular senescence, colony-forming efficiencies (CFEs), MSC cell marker expression, and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation. CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs demonstrated similar morphologies and PDs, reaching 100 PDs. Both populations exhibited consistent telomere lengths (12-17 kb), minimal senescence, and positive telomerase expression. CB-MSCs (PD15) had significantly lower CFEs than PD50. CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs both expressed MSC (CD73/CD90/CD105); embryonic (Nanog) and osteogenic markers (Runx2, osteocalcin) but no hematopoietic markers (CD45). CB-MSCs (PD15) strongly expressed Oct4 and p16(INK4A). At early PDs, CB-MSCs possessed a strong osteogenic potency and low potency for adipogenesis, whilst BM-MSCs possessed greater overall bipotentiality for osteogenesis and adipogenesis. At PD50, CB-MSCs demonstrated reduced potency for both osteogenesis and adipogenesis, compared to BM-MSCs at equivalent PDs. This study demonstrates similarities in proliferative and mesenchymal cell characteristics between CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs, but contrasting multipotentiality. Such findings support further comparisons of human CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs, facilitating selection of optimal MSC populations for regenerative medicine purposes.

Molecular subtypes and differentiation programmes of glioma stem cells as determinants of extracellular vesicle profiles and endothelial cell-stimulating activities	JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES												We have previously uncovered the impact of oncogenic and differentiation processes on extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cancer. This is of interested in the context of glioma stem cells (GSC) that are responsible for recurrent nature of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), while retaining the potential to undergo differentiation and self renewal. GSCs reside in vascular niches where they interact with endothelial cells through a number of mediators including bioactive cargo of EVs. GSCs can be classified as proneural (PN) or mesenchymal (MES) subtypes on the basis of their gene expression profiles and distinct biological characteristics. In the present study we investigated how GSC diversity and differentiation programmes influence their EV-mediated communication potentials. Indeed, molecular subtypes of GBMs and GSCs differ with respect to their expression of EV-related genes (vesiculome) and GSCs with PN or MES phenotypes produce EVs with markedly different characteristics, marker profiles, proteomes and endothelial stimulating activities. For example, while EVs of PN GSC are largely devoid of exosomal markers their counterparts from MES GSCs express ample CD9, CD63 and CD81 tetraspanins. In both GSC subtypes serum-induced differentiation results in profound, but distinct changes of cellular phenotypes including the enhanced EV production, reconfiguration of their proteomes and the related functional pathways. Notably, the EV uptake was a function of both subtype and differentiation state of donor cells. Thus, while, EVs produced by differentiated MES GSCs were internalized less efficiently than those from undifferentiated cells they exhibited an increased stimulatory potential for human brain endothelial cells. Such stimulating activity was also observed for EVs derived from differentiated PN GSCs, despite their even weaker uptake by endothelial cells. These findings suggest that the role of EVs as biological mediators and biomarkers in GBM may depend on the molecular subtype and functional state of donor cancer cells, including cancer stem cells.

Locally controlling mesenchymal stem cell morphogenesis by 3D PDGF-BB gradients towards the establishment of an in vitro perivascular niche	INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY												The perivascular niche is a complex microenvironment containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), among other perivascular cells, as well as temporally organized biochemical and biophysical gradients. Due to a lack of conclusive phenotypic markers, MSCs' identity, heterogeneity and function within their native niche remain poorly understood. The in vitro reconstruction of an artificial three-dimensional (3D) perivascular niche would offer a powerful alternative to study MSC behavior under more defined conditions. To this end, we here present a poly(ethylene glycol)-based in vitro model that begins to mimic the spatiotemporally controlled presentation of biological cues within the in vivo perivascular niche, namely a stably localized platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-BB) gradient. We show that 3D-encapsulated MSCs respond to soluble PDGF-BB by proliferation, spreading, and migration in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the exposure of MSCs to 3D matrix-tethered PDGF-BB gradients resulted in locally restricted morphogenetic responses, much as would be expected in a native perivascular niche. Thus, the herein presented artificial perivascular niche model provides an important first step towards modeling the role of MSCs during tissue homeostasis and regeneration.

Single cell sorting identifies progenitor cell population from full thickness bovine articular cartilage	OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE												Objective: To date, no approved clinical intervention successfully prevents the progressive degradation of injured articular cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis (OA). Stem/progenitor cell populations within tissues of diarthrodial joint have shown their therapeutic potential in treating OA. However, this potential has not been fully realized due in part to the heterogeneity of these subpopulations. Characterization of clonal populations derived from a single cell may help identify more homogenous stem/progenitor populations within articular cartilage. Moreover, chondrogenic potential of clonal populations from different zones could be further examined to elucidate their differential roles in maintaining articular cartilage homeostasis. Method: We combined Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and clonogenicity screening to identify stem/progenitor cells cloned from single cells. High-efficiency colony-forming cells (HCCs) were isolated, and evaluated for stem/progenitor cell characteristics. HCCs were also isolated from different zones of articular cartilage. Their function was compared by lineage-specific gene expression, and differentiation potential. Results: A difference in colony-forming efficiency was observed in terms of colony sizes. HCCs were highly clonogenic and multipotent, and overexpressed stem/progenitor cell markers. Also, proliferation and migration associated genes were over-expressed in HCCs. HCCs showed zonal differences with deep HCCs more chondrogenic and osteogenic than superficial HCCs. Conclusion: Our approach is a simple yet practical way to identify homogeneous stem/progenitor cell populations with clonal origin. The discovery of progenitor cells demonstrates the intrinsic self-repairing potential of articular cartilage. Differences in differentiation potential may represent the distinct roles of superficial and deep zone stem/progenitor cells in the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis.

In this study, we applied our newly developed technique of single cell analysis to the myometrial infiltration side (M-side) and the endometrial side (E-side) of a human endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation tissues. We also analyzed spherogenic cultures derived from the same tissue to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Cancer cells in the E-side were highly malignant compared with those in the M-side. Many cells on the E-side were positive for spheroid-specific tumorigenesis-related markers including SOX2. In addition, there were higher numbers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cells in the E-side compared with the M-side. This study identified a site containing cells with high malignant potential such as EMT and cancer stem-like cells in cancer tissues. Finally, we demonstrate that established endometrioid adenocarcinoma subtype classifiers were variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor. Thus, such intratumoral heterogeneity may be related to prognostic implications.

J	Drouet, M; Herodin, F				Drouet, Michel; Herodin, Francis			Radiation victim management and the haematologist in the future: Time to revisit therapeutic guidelines?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY												Purpose: The use of nuclear/radiation devices against the civilian population is now a realistic scenario. Haematopoietic syndrome is the primary therapeutic challenge in the case of whole body acute exposure over 2 Grays (Gy) whereas burns and combined injuries would be frequently observed in myelo-suppressed patients. Optimisation of scoring and treatments are important goals to achieve. Conclusion: The European Response Category (RC) concept represents an attempt to integratively assess haematological/ extrahematological radiation-induced lesions. Based on the frequently observed heterogeneity of bone marrow damage in accidental/intentional irradiations, the stimulation of residual stem cells using granulocyte Colony-stimulating factor remains the therapeutic standard after exposure to less than the lethal dose 50 % (Haematopoietic[H] score 3-H3). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is indicated in case of medullary eradication (Haematopoietic score 4-H4) whereas extramedullary toxicity may determine the outcome. Especially in case of numerous casualties exhibiting acute radiation sydrome, the administration of survival factor combinations remains questionable, at least as a palliative treatment. In addition pleiotropic cytokines injection such as erythropoietin and keratinocyte growth factor and grafting multipotent mesenchymal stem cells from underexposed bone marrow areas or fat tissues -could be proposed to prevent multiple organ failure syndrome development.

Rod			Visualization and Quantification of Mesenchymal Cell Adipogenic Differentiation Potential with a Lineage Specific Marker	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Several dyes are currently available for use in detecting differentiation of mesenchymal cells into adipocytes. Dyes, such as Oil Red O, are cheap, easy to use and widely utilized by laboratories analyzing the adipogenic potential of mesenchymal cells. However, they are not specific to changes in gene transcription. We have developed a gene-specific differentiation assay to analyze when a mesenchymal cell has switched its fate to an adipogenic lineage. Immuno-labelling against fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), a lineage-specific marker of adipogenic differentiation, enabled visualization and quantification of differentiated cells. The ability to quantify adipogenic differentiation potential of mesenchymal cells in a 96 well microplate format has promising implications for a number of applications. Hundreds of clinical trials involve the use of adult mesenchymal stromal cells and it is currently difficult to correlate therapeutic outcomes within and especially between such clinical trials. This simple high-throughput FABP4 assay provides a quantitative assay for assessing the differentiation potential of patient-derived cells and is a robust tool for comparing different isolation and expansion methods. This is particularly important given the increasing recognition of the heterogeneity of the cells being administered to patients in mesenchymal cell products. The assay also has potential utility in high throughput drug screening, particularly in obesity and pre-diabetes research.

Modeling triple-negative breast cancer heterogeneity: Effects of stromal macrophages, fibroblasts and tumor vasculature	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												A hallmark of breast tumors is its spatial heterogeneity that includes its distribution of cancer stem cells and progenitor cells, but also heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. In this study we focus on the contributions of stromal cells, specifically macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells on tumor progression. We develop a computational model of triple-negative breast cancer based on our previous work and expand it to include macrophage infiltration, fibroblasts, and angiogenesis. In vitro studies have shown that the secretomes of tumor-educated macrophages and fibroblasts increase both the migration and proliferation rates of triple-negative breast cancer cells. In vivo studies also demonstrated that blocking signaling of selected secreted factors inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenograft models. We investigate the influences of increased migration and proliferation rates on tumor growth, the effect of the presence on fibroblasts or macrophages on growth and morphology, and the contributions of macrophage infiltration on tumor growth. We find that while the presence of macrophages increases overall tumor growth, the increase in macrophage infiltration does not substantially increase tumor growth and can even stifle tumor growth at excessive rates.

Especially, cancer stem cells (CSCs) may exhibit self-renewal capacity, which makes it harder for complete elimination of tumor. Therefore, simultaneously inhibiting CSCs and non-CSCs in tumors becomes a promising strategy to obtain sustainable anticancer efficacy. Salinomycin (Sal) was reported to be critical to inhibit CSCs. However, the poor bioavailability and catastrophic side effects brought about limitations to clinical practice. To solve this problem, we previously constructed gelatinase-stimuli nanoparticles composed of nontoxic, biocompatible polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (PEG-PCL) copolymer with a gelatinase-cleavable peptide Pro-Val-Gly-Leu-Iso-Gly (PVGLIG) inserted between the two blocks of the copolymer. By applying our "smart" gelatinase-responsive nanoparticles for Sal delivery, we have demonstrated specific accumulation in tumor, anti-CSCs ability and reduced toxicity of Sal-NPs in our previous study. In the present study, we synthesized Sal-Docetaxel-loaded gelatinase-stimuli nanoparticles (Sal-Doc NP) and confirmed single emulsion as the optimal method of producing Sal-Doc NPs (Sal-Doc SE-NP) in comparison with nanoprecipitation. Sal-Doc SE-NPs inhibited both CSCs and non-CSCs in mice transplanted with cervical cancer, and might be associated with enhanced restriction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Besides, the tumorigenic capacity and growing speed were obviously suppressed in Sal-Doc-SE-NPs-treated group in rechallenge experiment. Our results suggest that Sal-Doc-loaded gelatinase-stimuli nanoparticles could be a promising strategy to enhance antitumor efficacy and reduce side effects by simultaneously suppressing CSCs and non-CSCs.

In order to investigate the heterogeneity and potential molecular mechanism of SCLCs in the treatment of peripheral nerve regeneration at a single cell level, single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to profile single cell populations of hAMSCs and SCLCs. We profiled 6,008 and 5,140 single cells from hAMSCs and SCLCs, respectively. Based on bioinformatics analysis, pathways associated with proliferation, ECM organization, and tissue repair were enriched within both populations. Cell cycle analysis indicated that single cells within these two populations remained mostly in the G0/G1 phase. The transformation of single cells from hAMSCs to SCLCs was characterized by pseudotime analysis. Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of SCLCs that highly expressed genes associated with Schwann cell proliferation, migration, and survival, such as JUN, JUND, and NRG1., Genes such as PTGS2, PITX1, VEGFA, and FGF2 that promote nerve regeneration were also highly expressed in single cells within this subpopulation, and terms associated with inflammatory and tissue repair were enriched in this subpopulation by pathway enrichment analysis. Our results indicate that a subpopulation of SCLCs with nerve regeneration signatures may be the key populations that promote nerve regeneration.																	1664-042X					MAY 10	2021	12								637924	10.3389/fphys.2021.637924							WOS:000657088400001	34093220

Single-cell atlas of early human brain development highlights heterogeneity of human neuroepithelial cells and early radial glia	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE												The human cortex comprises diverse cell types that emerge from an initially uniform neuroepithelium that gives rise to radial glia, the neural stem cells of the cortex. To characterize the earliest stages of human brain development, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing across regions of the developing human brain, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain and cerebellum. We identify nine progenitor populations physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting more heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears once neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse progenitor populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor clusters that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical development. We also find that organoid systems display low fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a comprehensive molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of human brain and cortical development.

The present study assesses the liver cells' stability during in vitro expansion, as a prerequisite for therapeutic use. Results: The human liver cell cultures in this study were propagated efficiently in vitro for at least 12 passages. No significant changes in morphology, intracellular ultrastructures and characteristic markers expression were found during in vitro expansion of cells from all analyzed donors. However, expanded cells derived from male donors of >60 years old, lost the Y chromosome. Conclusion: Liver-derived cell cultures adopt a proliferative, stable mesenchymal phenotype, through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition process. The molecular and phenotypic changes of the cells during propagation are uniform, despite the heterogeneity of the different donors. Loss of Y chromosome occurs after cells' propagation in elder male donors.

Superior breast cancer metastasis risk stratification using an epithelial-mesenchymal-amoeboid transition gene signature	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH												Background Cancer cells are known to display varying degrees of metastatic propensity, but the molecular basis underlying such heterogeneity remains unclear. Our aims in this study were to (i) elucidate prognostic subtypes in primary tumors based on an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (EMAT) continuum that captures the heterogeneity of metastatic propensity and (ii) to more comprehensively define biologically informed subtypes predictive of breast cancer metastasis and survival in lymph node-negative (LNN) patients. Methods We constructed a novel metastasis biology-based gene signature (EMAT) derived exclusively from cancer cells induced to undergo either epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (MAT) to gauge their metastatic potential. Genome-wide gene expression data obtained from 913 primary tumors of lymph node-negative breast cancer (LNNBC) patients were analyzed. EMAT gene signature-based prognostic stratification of patients was performed to identify biologically relevant subtypes associated with distinct metastatic propensity. Results Delineated EMAT subtypes display a biologic range from less stem-like to more stem-like cell states and from less invasive to more invasive modes of cancer progression. Consideration of EMAT subtypes in combination with standard clinical parameters significantly improved survival prediction. EMAT subtypes outperformed prognosis accuracy of receptor or PAM50-based BC intrinsic subtypes even after adjusting for treatment variables in 3 independent, LNNBC cohorts including a treatment-naive patient cohort. Conclusions EMAT classification is a biologically informed method that provides prognostic information beyond that which can be provided by traditional cancer staging or PAM50 molecular subtype status and may improve metastasis risk assessment in early stage, LNNBC patients, who may otherwise be perceived to be at low metastasis risk.																	1465-5411	1465-542X				JUL 8	2020	22	1							74	10.1186/s13058-020-01304-8							WOS:000551798400001	32641077

Deficiency of CCN5/WISP-2-Driven Program in breast cancer Promotes Cancer Epithelial cells to mesenchymal stem cells and Breast Cancer growth	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Breast cancer progression and relapse is conceivably due to tumor initiating cells (TICs)/cancer stem cells. EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal-transition)-signaling regulates TICs' turnover. However, the mechanisms associated with this episode are unclear. We show that, in triple-negative-breast cancer (TNBC) cells enriched with TICs, CCN5 significantly blocks cellular growth via apoptosis, reversing EMT-signaling and impairing mammosphere formation, thereby blocking the tumor-forming ability and invasive capacity of these cells. To corroborate these findings, we isolated tumor-initiating side populations (SP) and non-side population (NSP or main population) from MCF-7 cell line, and evaluated the impact of CCN5 on these subpopulations. CCN5 was overexpressed in the NSP but downregulated in the SP. Characteristically, NSP cells are ER-alpha positive and epithelial type with little tumorigenic potency, while SP cells are very similar to triple-negative ones that do not express ER-alpha-and Her-2 and are highly tumorigenic in xenograft models. The overexpression of CCN5 in SP results in EMT reversion, ER-alpha upregulation and delays in tumor growth in xenograft models. We reasoned that CCN5 distinguishes SP and NSP and could reprogram SP to NSP transition, thereby delaying tumor growth in the xenograft model. Collectively, we reveal how CCN5-signaling underlies the driving force to prevent TNBC growth and progression.

We performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity in colorectal tumors and their microenvironments using single-cell RNA-seq from 11 primary colorectal tumors and matched normal mucosa. To robustly cluster single-cell transcriptomes, we developed reference component analysis (RCA), an algorithm that substantially improves clustering accuracy. Using RCA, we identified two distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were found to be upregulated only in the CAF subpopulation of tumor samples. Notably, colorectal tumors previously assigned to a single subtype on the basis of bulk transcriptomics could be divided into subgroups with divergent survival probability by using single-cell signatures, thus underscoring the prognostic value of our approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that unbiased single-cell RNA-seq profiling of tumor and matched normal samples provides a unique opportunity to characterize aberrant cell states within a tumor.

Here, we establish libraries of glioma-initiating cell (GIC) clones from patient samples and find extensive molecular and phenotypic variability among clones, including a range of responses to radiation and drugs. This widespread variability was observed as a continuumof multitherapy resistance phenotypes linked to a proneural-mesenchymal shift in the transcriptome. Multitherapy resistance was associated with a semi-stable cell state that was characterized by an altered DNA methylation pattern at promoter regions of mesenchymal master regulators and enhancers. The gradient of cell states within the GIC compartment constitutes a distinct form of heterogeneity. Our findings may open an avenue toward the development of new therapeutic rationales designed to reverse resistant cell states.

Phenotypic and Expressional Heterogeneity in the Invasive Glioma Cells	TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY												BACKGROUND: Tumor cell invasion is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) and a major contributing factor for treatment failure, tumor recurrence, and the poor prognosis of GBM. Despite this, our understanding of the molecular machinery that drives invasion is limited. METHODS: Time-lapse imaging of patient-derived GBM cell invasion in a 3D collagen gel matrix, analysis of both the cellular invasive phenotype and single cell invasion pattern with microarray expression profiling. RESULTS: GBM invasion was maintained in a simplified 3D-milieue. Invasion was promoted by the presence of the tumorsphere graft. In the absence of this, the directed migration of cells subsided. The strength of the pro-invasive repulsive signaling was specific for a given patient-derived culture. In the highly invasive GBM cultures, the majority of cells had a neural progenitor-like phenotype, while the less invasive cultures had a higher diversity in cellular phenotypes. Microarray expression analysis of the non-invasive cells from the tumor core displayed a higher GFAP expression and a signature of genes containing VEGFA, hypoxia and chemo-repulsive signals. Cells of the invasive front expressed higher levels of CTGF. TNFRSF12A and genes involved in cell survival, migration and cell cycle pathways. A mesenchymal gene signature was associated with increased invasion. CONCLUSION: The GBM tumorsphere core promoted invasion, and the invasive front was dominated by a phenotypically defined cell population expressing genes regulating traits found in aggressive cancers. The detected cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional differences between the highly invasive and core cells identifies potential targets for manipulation of GBM invasion.

Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are implicated in this poor prognosis and in radio(chemo-)resistance. We have previously demonstrated that among potentially highly specific GSC markers oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) appears to be the most specific and cyclin D2 (CCND2) the only one related to cell cycle regulation. The purpose of this work was to investigate the clinical significance and the evolution of OLIG2 and CCND2 protein expression in GBM. Methods and results Immunohistochemical expression analysis of Olig2 and Ccnd2 was carried out on a cohort of human paired GBM samples comparing initial resections with local recurrent tumors after radiation therapy (RT) alone or radio-chemotherapy with temozolomide (RT-TMZ). Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that significant risk factors predicting early mortality (<12 months) are: subtotal surgery for recurrence, time to recurrence <6 months, Ccnd2 nuclear expression at initial surgery >= 30%, and Olig2 nuclear expression We demonstrated that patients for whom nuclear expression of Olig2 becomes low (<30%) after adjuvant treatments have a significantly shorter time to recurrence and survival reflecting most probably a proneural to mesenchymal transition of the GSCs population. We also highlighted the fact that at initial surgery, high nuclear expression (>= 30%) of CCND2, a G1/S regulator specific of GSCs, has a prognostic value and is associated with early mortality (<12 months).

Delta Np63/p40 correlates with the location and phenotype of basal/mesenchymal cancer stem-like cells in human ER+ and HER2(+) breast cancers	JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY CLINICAL RESEARCH												Delta Np63, also known as p40, regulates stemness of normal mammary gland epithelium and provides stem cell characteristics in basal and HER2-driven murine breast cancer models. Whilst Delta Np63/p40 is a characteristic feature of normal basal cells and basal-type triple-negative breast cancer, some receptor-positive breast cancers express Delta Np63/p40 and its overexpression imparts cancer stem cell-like properties in ER+ cell lines. However, the incidence of ER+ and HER2(+) tumours that express Delta Np63/p40 is unclear and the phenotype of Delta Np63/p40(+) cells in these tumours remains uncertain. Using immunohistochemistry with p63 isoform-specific antibodies, we identified a Delta Np63/p40(+) tumour cell subpopulation in 100 of 173 (58%) non-triple negative breast cancers and the presence of this population associated with improved survival in patients with ER-/HER2(+) tumours (p = 0.006). Furthermore, 41% of ER+/PR+ and/or HER2(+) locally metastatic breast cancers expressed Delta Np63/p40, and these cells commonly accounted for <1% of the metastatic tumour cell population that localised to the tumour/stroma interface, exhibited an undifferentiated phenotype and were CD44(+)/ALDH(-). In vitro studies revealed that MCF7 and T47D (ER+) and BT-474 (HER2(+)) breast cancer cell lines similarly contained a small subpopulation of Delta Np63/p40(+) cells that increased in mammospheres. In vivo, MCF7 xenografts contained Delta Np63/p40(+) cells with a similar phenotype to primary ER+ cancers. Consistent with tumour samples, these cells also showed a distinct location at the tumour/stroma interface, suggesting a role for paracrine factors in the induction or maintenance of Delta Np63/p40. Thus, Delta Np63/p40 is commonly present in a small population of tumour cells with a distinct phenotype and location in ER+ and/or HER2(+) human breast cancers.

However, systemic IL-6 levels also increase during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells in healthy donors, but it is not known whether this mobilization alters systemic levels of other IL-6 family cytokines/receptors and whether such effects differ between donors. We examined how G-CSF administration influenced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (85 donors) and serum levels of IL-6 family cytokines/receptors (20 donors). G-CSF increased CRP levels especially in elderly donors with high pretherapy levels, but these preharvesting levels did not influence clinical outcomes (nonrelapse mortality, graft versus host disease). The increased IL-6 levels during G-CSF therapy normalized within 24 h after treatment. G-CSF administration did not alter serum levels of other IL-6-familly mediators. Oncostatin M, but not IL-6, showed a significant correlation with CRP levels during G-CSF therapy. Clustering analysis of mediator levels during G-CSF administration identified two donor subsets mainly characterized by high oncostatin M and IL-6 levels, respectively. Finally, G-CSF could increase IL-6 release by in vitro cultured monocytes, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells. In summary, G-CSF seems to induce an acute phase reaction with increased systemic IL-6 levels in healthy stem cell donors.																		1422-0067				OCT	2018	19	10							2886	10.3390/ijms19102886							WOS:000448951000041	30249022

Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell features are major mechanisms for metastasis. Patients & methods: Using a triple fluorescence technique, the expression of EMT (N-cadherin) and stem cell markers (CD133) was analyzed in CTCs detected via cytokeratin in blood samples from 26 metastatic breast cancer patients. Results: We detected CTCs in 100% of the patients (n = 831 CTCs). In total, 67% of the CTCs were N-cadherin and CD133 negative. Nonetheless, 87.8 and 57.6%, respectively, of the CTCs that expressed one marker coexpressed the other. Both double-negative and double-positive CTCs were present in more than 90% of the patients. Within the CTCs of each patient, we demonstrated striking heterogeneities of marker expressions, cell shapes, clusters and sizes. Conclusion: These data outline the importance of characterizing CTCs, especially through stem cell and EMT markers.

Low-density plating promoted proliferation of small recycling stem (RS) cells that appeared to be the most multipotent cells in the cultures. Here we demonstrated that MSCs from rat bone marrow (rMSCs) are even more sensitive to low-density plating than hMSCs, When plated at approximately 2 cells/cm(2), the cells expanded over 4,000-fold in 12 days, over twice the maximal rate observed with hMSCs, Analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter demonstrated that rMSCs had the same heterogeneity seen with hMSCs in that the cultures contained both small rapidly RS cells and much larger mature cells (mMSCs), The rat mMSCs differed from human mMSCs in that they regenerated RS cells in culture. Also, after low-density plating, colonies of rMSCs expanded into confluent cultures, whereas colonies of hMSCs did not.																	1066-5099	1549-4918					2001	19	3					219	225		10.1634/stemcells.19-3-219							WOS:000168989700006	11359947

Although their biological importance is undisputed, the level of mesenchymal cell heterogeneity within and between organs, while appreciated, has not been analyzed in detail. Here, we compare single-cell transcriptional profiles of fibroblasts and vascular mural cells across four murine muscular organs: heart, skeletal muscle, intestine and bladder. We reveal gene expression signatures that demarcate fibroblasts from mural cells and provide molecular signatures for cell subtype identification. We observe striking inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity amongst the fibroblasts, primarily reflecting differences in the expression of extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast subtypes localize to discrete anatomical positions offering novel predictions about physiological function(s) and regulatory signaling circuits. Our data shed new light on the diversity of poorly defined classes of cells and provide a foundation for improved understanding of their roles in physiological and pathological processes. To define and distinguish fibroblasts from vascular mural cells have remained challenging. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and tissue imaging, the authors provide a molecular basis for cell type classification and reveal inter- and intra-organ diversity of these cell types.

We used a four-color flow cytometry strategy to immunophenotype seven human breast cancer cell cultures and four reference breast cancer cell lines. We analyzed 28 surface markers selected based on their potential to distinguish epithelial or mesenchymal lineage, to identify stem cell populations, and to mediate cell adhesion and migration. We determined their ability to form mammospheres and analyzed luminal cytokeratins CK18, CK19, and myoepithelial/basal CK5, SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), and vimentin expression by western blot. All cell surface markers showed a unimodal profile. Ten/28 markers were homogenously expressed. Four (CD66b, CD66c, CD165, CD324) displayed negative/low expression. Six (CD29, CD55, CD59, CD81, CD151, CD166) displayed homogenous high expression. Eighteen (CD9, CD10, CD24, CD26, CD44, CD47, CD49b, CD49f, CD54, CD61, CD90, CD105, CD133, CD164, CD184, CD200, CD227, CD326) were heterogeneously expressed. Spearman's rank test demonstrated a significant correlation (p< 0.001) between mesenchymal phenotype and breast cancer cell cultures. Breast cancer cell cultures, all CD44+, displayed concomitant high expression of only three antigens (CD10, CD54, CD90), and low expression of CD326; cell cultures formed mammospheres and expressed CK5, SMA and vimentin, and were weakly CK19-positive. We demonstrate that breast cancer cell cultures preserve inter-tumor heterogeneity and express stem/progenitor markers that can be identified, quantified and categorized by flow cytometry. Therefore, cell cultures can be used for in vitro modeling of breast cancer subtypes; immunophenotyping may mirror breast cancer heterogeneity and reveal molecular characteristics of individual tumors useful for testing target therapy.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, and miR-21, all of which contribute to cell migration for metastasis, are interrelated with CSCs. In the present study, third-sphere forming (3-S) CSC-like cells, which showed elevated CSC surface markers (ALDH1+ and CD44+/CD24-/low) and sphereforming capacity as well as migration and invasion capacities, were cultured and isolated from breast cancer MCF-7 parental cells, to evaluate the role of miR-21 in regulating the CSC-like cell biological features, especially EMT. EMT, which was assessed by overexpression of mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin [a-SMA]) and suppression of epithelial cell marker (E-cadherin), was induced in 3-S CSC-like cells. Moreover, both of HIF-1a and miR-21 were upregulated in the CSC-like cells. Interestingly, antagonism of miR-21 by antagomir led to reversal of EMT, downexpression of HIF-1a, as well as suppression of invasion and migration, which indicates a key role of miR-21 involved in regulate CSC-associated features. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the formation of CSC-like cells undergoing process of EMT-like associated with overexpression of HIF-1a, both of which are regulated by miR-21.

Managing wound healing and pain remains an important issue, especially in pathologies such as excessive scarring (often leading to fibrosis) or deficient healing, leading to chronic wounds. Recent Advances: Advances in therapies using mesenchymal stromal cells offer new insights for treating indications that previously lacked options. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSCs) are now being used to a much greater extent in clinical trials for regenerative medicine. However, to be really valid, these randomized trials must imperatively follow strict guidelines such as consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) statement. Indeed, AD-MSCs, because of their paracrine activities and multipotency, have potential to cure degenerative and/or inflammatory diseases. Combined with their relatively easy access (from adipose tissue) and proliferation capacity, AD-MSCs represent an excellent candidate for allogeneic treatments. Critical Issues: The success of AD-MSC therapy may depend on the robustness of the biological functions of AD-MSCs, which requires controlling source heterogeneity and production processes, and development of biomarkers that predict desired responses. Several studies have investigated the effect of AD-MSCs on innervation, wound repair, or pain management separately, but systematic evaluation of how those effects could be combined is lacking. Future Directions: Future studies that explore how AD-MSC therapy can be used to treat difficult-to-heal wounds, underlining the need to thoroughly characterize the cells used, and standardization of preparation processes are needed. Finally, how this a priori easy-to-use cell therapy treatment fits into clinical management of pain, improvement of tissue healing, and patient quality of life, all need to be explored.																	2162-1918	2162-1934				JAN 1	2021	10	1					24	48		10.1089/wound.2020.1175		JUN 2020					WOS:000538178400001	32470315

In this study, by taking advantage of the resolution of the single cell transcriptome, we analyzed Sca-1 and PDGFR-alpha fraction in the mouse bone marrow tissue. The single cell transcriptome enabled us to further classify the population into seven populations according to their gene expression profiles. We then separately obtained the seven populations based on candidate marker genes, and specified their gene expression properties and epigenetic landscape by ATAC-seq. Our findings will enable to elucidate the stem cell niche signal in the bone marrow microenvironment, reconstitute bone marrow in vitro, and shed light on the potentially important role of identified subpopulation in various clinical applications to the treatment of bone- and bone marrow-related diseases.

This study identified and characterized cancer stem cells (CSCs) within colon adenocarcinoma metastasis to the liver (CAML). Methods: 3,3-Diaminobenzidine immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on nine CAML samples for embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-Myc, and KLF4. Immunofluorescence (IF) IHC staining was performed to investigate coexpression of two markers. NanoString mRNA expression analysis and colorimetric in situ hybridization (CISH) were performed on four snap-frozen CAML tissue samples for transcript expression of these ESC markers. Cells stained positively and negatively for each marker by IHC and CISH staining were counted and analyzed. Results: 3,3-Diaminobenzidine IHC staining, and NanoString and CISH mRNA analyses demonstrated the expression of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-Myc, and KLF4 within in all nine CAML samples, except for SOX2 which was below detectable levels on NanoString mRNA analysis. IF IHC staining showed the presence of a SOX2+/NANOG+/KLF4+/c-Myc+/OCT-CSC subpopulation within the tumor nests, and a SOX2+/NANOG+/KLF4+/c-Myc+/OCT4-CSC subpopulation and a SOX2+/NANOG+/KLF4+/c-Myc+/OCT4+ CSC subpopulation within the peritumoral stroma.

TUMOR BIOLOGY												Cancer stem cell (CSC) markers could serve as potential prognostic procedure. This study is aimed to investigate the local expression of doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) and Lgr5 in colorectal cancer tissues (CRC) at both protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) level, followed by providing a comparison of the local and circulating expression pattern of these markers, based on our present and previous study. The mRNA expression level of DCLK1 and Lgr5 was evaluated using comparative real-time PCR method applying 58 fresh tumor tissues and their correspondent normal margins. Immunohistochemistry was applied to analyze the protein expression level of DCLK1 and Lgr5 in paraffin-embedded CRC tissues. The correlation of DCLK1 and Lgr5 expression pattern with clinicopathological characteristics was assessed. A higher mRNA expression level of DCLK1 (3.28-fold change, p < 0.001) and Lgr5 (2.29-fold change, p < 0.001) was observed in CRC fresh tissues compared to the normal adjacent margins, and the expression level was higher in patients with higher grade and stages of disease and patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The protein expression level of DCLK1 and Lgr5 was also increased significantly in tumor tissues compared to normal colon tissues which were positively correlated to tumor stage and grade and neoadjuvant CRT. Taken together, the results of protein analysis were in accordance with mRNA assessment. The local expression pattern of DCLK1 and Lgr5 was also in accordance with their expression level in circulation. However, some minor inconsistencies were observed which may be attributed to several factors including the possible effect of CRT on CSC reprogramming.

Specific characterization of tumor cells and their microenvironment in a multi-parameter molecular assay could significantly improve prognostic accuracy for the heterogeneous prostate tumor tissue. Novel functionalized gold-nano particles allow fluorescence-based detection of absolute mRNA expression levels in living cells by fluorescent activated flow cytometry (FACS). We use of this technique to separate prostate tumor and benign cells in human prostate needle biopsies based on the expression levels of the tumor marker alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). We combined RNA and protein detection of living cells by FACS to gate for epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) positive tumor and benign cells, EPCAM/CD45 double negative mesenchymal cells and CD45 positive infiltrating lymphocytes. EPCAM positive epithelial cells were further sub-gated into AMACR high and low expressing cells. Two hundred cells from each population and several biopsies from the same patient were analyzed using a multiplexed gene expression profile to generate a cell type resolved profile of the specimen. This technique provides the basis for the clinical evaluation of cell type resolved gene expression profiles as pre-therapeutic prognostic markers for prostate cancer.

Fractal heterogeneity in minimal matrix models of scars modulates stiff-niche stem-cell responses via nuclear exit of a mechanorepressor	NATURE MATERIALS												Scarring is a long-lasting problem in higher animals, and reductionist approaches could aid in developing treatments. Here, we show that copolymerization of collagen I with polyacrylamide produces minimal matrix models of scars (MMMS), in which fractal-fibre bundles segregate heterogeneously to the hydrogel subsurface. Matrix stiffens locally-as in scars-while allowing separate control over adhesive-ligand density. The MMMS elicits scar-like phenotypes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs): cells spread and polarize quickly, increasing nucleoskeletal lamin-A yet expressing the 'scar marker' smooth muscle actin (SMA) more slowly. Surprisingly, expression responses to MMMS exhibit less cell-to-cell noise than homogeneously stiff gels. Such differences from bulk-average responses arise because a strong SMA repressor, NKX2.5, slowly exits the nucleus on rigid matrices. NKX2.5 overexpression overrides rigid phenotypes, inhibiting SMA and cell spreading, whereas cytoplasm-localized NKX2.5 mutants degrade in well-spread cells. MSCs thus form a 'mechanical memory' of rigidity by progressively suppressing NKX2.5, thereby elevating SMA in a scar-like state.					Bradshaw, Andrew/0000-0001-8086-7787; Dingal, P. C.

Combining targeted drugs to overcome and prevent resistance of solid cancers with some stem-like cell features	ONCOTARGET												Treatment resistance significantly inhibits the efficiency of targeted cancer therapies in drug-sensitive genotypes. In the current work, we studied mechanisms for rapidly occurring, adaptive resistance in targeted therapy-sensitive lung, breast, and melanoma cancer cell lines. The results show that in ALK translocated lung cancer lines H3122 and H2228, cells with cancer stem-like cell features characterized by high expression of cancer stem cell markers and/or in vivo tumorigenesis can mediate adaptive resistance to oncogene ablative therapy. When pharmacological ablation of ALK oncogene was accompanied with PI3K inhibitor or salinomycin therapy, cancer stem-like cell features were reversed which was accompanied with decreased colony formation. Furthermore, co-targeting was able to block the formation of acquired resistance in H3122 line. The results suggest that cells with cancer stem-like cell features can mediate adaptive resistance to targeted therapies. Since these cells follow the stochastic model, concurrent therapy with an oncogene ablating agent and a stem-like cell-targeting drug is needed for maximal therapeutic efficiency.

Here, we dissect glioblastoma-to-microenvironment interactions by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human tumors and model systems, combined with functional experiments. We demonstrate that macrophages induce a transition of glioblastoma cells into mesenchymal-like (MES-like) states. This effect is mediated, both in vitro and in vivo, by macrophage-derived oncostatin M(OSM) that interacts with its receptors (OSMR or LIFR) in complex with GP130 on glioblastoma cells and activates STAT3. We show that MES-like glioblastoma states are also associated with increased expression of a mesenchymal program in macrophages and with increased cytotoxicity of T cells, highlighting extensive alterations of the immune microenvironment with potential therapeutic implications.

Extracellular Matrix Produced by Bone Marrow Stromal Cells and by Their Derivative, SB623 Cells, Supports Neural Cell Growth	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH												Several studies have shown the benefits of transplanting bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) into neurodegenerative lesions of the central nervous system, despite a low engraftment rate and the poor persistence of grafts. It is known that the extracellular matrix (ECM) modulates neuritogenesis and glial growth, but little is known about effects of MSC-derived ECM on neural cells. In this study, we demonstrate in vitro that the ECM produced by MSC can support neural cell attachment and growth. We also compare the neurosupportive properties of MSC to the MSC derivative, SB623 cells, which is being developed as a cell therapy for stroke. Embryonic rat brain cortical cells cultured for 3 weeks on human MSC- and SB623 cell-derived ECM exhibit about a 1.5 and 3 times higher metabolic activity, respectively, compared with the cultures grown on poly-D-lysine (PDL), although the initial neural cell adhesion to cell-derived ECM and PDL is similar. The MSC- and SB623 cell-derived ECM protects neural cells from nutrient and growth factor deprivation. Under the conditions used, only neurons grow on PDL. In contrast, both MSC- and SB623 cell-derived ECMs support the growth of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, as demonstrated by immunostaining. Morphologically, neurons on cell-derived ECM form more complex and extended neurite networks than those cultured on PDL. Together, these data indicate that the beneficial effect of MSC and SB623 cells in neurotransplantation could be explained in part by the neurosupportive properties of the ECM produced by these cells.

However, heterogeneity exists between MSCs derived from different donors in their bone formation ability both in vitro and in vivo. The identification of markers defining MSCs with different functional phenotypes is fundamental to maximize their clinical potential. In our previous in vivo study, impaired expression in MSCs of cystathionine--synthase (CBS) and cystathionine--lyase (CSE), the two key enzymes in the catabolic pathway of homocysteine, was associated to decreased bone formation and to the onset of osteoporosis in mice. Here, we investigated whether osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs (hMSCs) modulates the expression of CBS and CSE. The expression of CBS and CSE was also assessed during chondrogenesis to confirm the specificity of their expression during osteogenesis. hMSCs displayed a heterogeneous mineralizing capacity between donors (70% of the samples mineralized, while 30% did not mineralize). Inducible expression of CBS and CSE was found to be associated with a mineralizing phenotype in hMSCs. In particular, up-regulation of CSE was restricted to hMSCs undergoing mineralization. During chondrogenesis, CBS was significantly up-regulated while CSE expression was not affected. Ex-vivo findings confirmed that mature h-osteoblasts (hOBs) show consistently higher expression of CBS and CSE than hMSCs. Our data provide the first evidence that the expression of CBS and CSE in hMSCs closely correlates with the transition of hMSCs toward the osteoblastic phenotype and that CSE may constitute a novel marker of osteogenic differentiation.

However, the spatiotemporal ontogeny of human embryonic SSCs during early skeletogenesis remains elusive. Here we map the transcriptional landscape of human limb buds and embryonic long bones at single-cell resolution to address this fundamental question. We found remarkable heterogeneity within human limb bud mesenchyme and epithelium, and aligned them along the proximal-distal and anterior-posterior axes using known marker genes. Osteo-chondrogenic progenitors first appeared in the core limb bud mesenchyme, which give rise to multiple populations of stem/progenitor cells in embryonic long bones undergoing endochondral ossification. Importantly, a perichondrial embryonic skeletal stem/progenitor cell (eSSPC) subset was identified, which could self-renew and generate the osteochondral lineage cells, but not adipocytes or hematopoietic stroma. eSSPCs are marked by the adhesion molecule CADM1 and highly enriched with FOXP1/2 transcriptional network. Interestingly, neural crest-derived cells with similar phenotypic markers and transcriptional networks were also found in the sagittal suture of human embryonic calvaria. Taken together, this study revealed the cellular heterogeneity and lineage hierarchy during human embryonic skeletogenesis, and identified distinct skeletal stem/progenitor cells that orchestrate endochondral and intramembranous ossification.

Genetic manipulation of adhesion GPCR CD97/ADGRE5 modulates invasion in patient-derived glioma stem cells	JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY												Introduction Effective glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is limited by high invasiveness and heterogeneity. Current therapies target proliferating Glioma Stem Cell (GSC) subpopulations while sparing invading GSCs, which eventually engender tumor recurrence after treatment. Surface receptor CD97/ADRGE5 is associated with invasion and metastasis regulation in non-CNS cancers. Although CD97 expression level positively correlates with poor GBM patient prognosis, its role in this tumor is unclear. Methods Here, we examined CD97 function in primary patient-derived GSCs (pdGSCs) obtained from five GBM tumors, belonging to three major genetic subtypes. We compared endogenous CD97 levels in pdGSCs to the corresponding patient MRI's radiographic invasion pattern aggressiveness. We manipulated CD97 levels in these pdGSCs by knockdown and overexpression and analyzed: (i) stem and subtype marker expression, (ii) in vitro invasive properties, and (iii) cell proliferation. Results Endogenous CD97 levels in pdGSCs positively correlated with radiographic invasion pattern aggressiveness on patient MRIs, and in vitro invasion rate. CD97 knockdown decreased pdGSC invasion rates in vitro, most markedly in mesenchymal subtype pdGSCs, as well as classical subtype pdGSCs. Invasion rates in vitro increased after CD97 overexpression predominately in proneural subtype pdGSCs. In the pdGSC line with the lowest endogenous CD97 level, CD97 overexpression increased the proliferation rate almost threefold. Conclusions For the first time in pdGSCs, we have shown that CD97 knockdown decreases and overexpression increases invasion rate in vitro. The effect of CD97 on invasion is pdGSC subtype-dependent. Future in vivo and mechanistic studies are needed for validation. Pharmacologic CD97 inhibitors should be identified, as they may potentially therapeutically diminish GBM invasion.

Fibroblast heterogeneity in prostate carcinogenesis	CANCER LETTERS												Our understanding of stromal components, specifically cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in prostate cancer (PCa), has evolved from considering these cells as inert bystanders to acknowledging their significance as players in prostate tumorigenesis. CAF are multifaceted-they promote cancer cell growth, migration and remodel the tumor microenvironment. Although targeting CAF could be a promising strategy for PCa treatment, they incorporate a high but undefined degree of intrinsic cellular heterogeneity. The interaction between CAF subpopulations, with the normal and tumor epithelium and with other cell types is not yet characterized. Defining these interactions and the critical signaling nodes that support tumorigenesis will enable the development of novel strategies to control prostate cancer progression. Here we will discuss the origins, molecular and functional heterogeneity of CAF in PCa. We highlight the challenges associated with delineating CAF heterogeneity and discuss potential areas of research that would assist in expanding our knowledge of CAF and their role in PCa tumorigenesis.

J	Baustian, C; Hanley, S; Ceredig, R				Baustian, Claas; Hanley, Shirley; Ceredig, Rhodri			Isolation, selection and culture methods to enhance clonogenicity of mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cell precursors	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY												Introduction: Conventionally cultured mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (mBM-MSC) are a heterogeneous population that often initially contain contaminating haematopoietic cells. Variability in isolation methods, culture protocols and the lack of specific mBM MSC markers might explain this heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to optimise the isolation, culture conditions and selection of mBM-MSC. Methods: Mouse BM-MSCs were isolated from crushed long bones (cBM) or flushed bone marrow (fBM) from 6-8 week old C57Bl/6 mice. These subpopulations were analysed by flow cytometry using commonly used mBM-MSC cell surface marker, e.g. Sca-1, CD29 and CD44. Cells were cultured and expanded in vitro in hypoxic conditions of either 2 % or 5 % oxygen. Cell sorting and qRT-PCR was used to determine transcript levels of stem cell and lineage related genes in individual subpopulations. Results: During early passaging not only do contaminating haematopoietic cells disappear, but there is a change in the phenotype of mBM-MSC affecting particularly CD44 and Sca-1 expression. By fluorescence activated cell sorting of CD45 /Ter119 mBM stroma based on Sca-1 expression and expansion in hypoxic conditions, we show that Sca-1(+) cells had higher CFU-F frequencies and showed enhanced proliferation compared with Sca-1(-) cells. As evaluated by in vitro assays and qRT-PCR, these cells presented in vitro tri-lineage differentiation along osteocyte, chondrocyte, and adipocyte lineages. Finally, by prospective isolation of Sca-1(+)PDGFR alpha(+)CD90(+) cells we have isolated mBM-MSC on a single cell level, achieving a CFU-F frequency of 1/4. Functional investigations demonstrated that these MSC clones inhibited T-lymphocyte proliferation. Conclusion: By positive selection using a combination of antibodies to Sca-1, CD90 and PDGFR alpha and culturing in hypoxia, we have found a subpopulation of BM cells from C57Bl/6 mice with a CFU-F cloning efficiency of 1/4. To our knowledge these results represent the highest frequencies of mouse MSC cloning from C57Bl/6 mice yet reported.

Non-enzymatic dissociation of human mesenchymal stromal cells improves chemokine-dependent migration and maintains immunosuppressive function	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can suppress inflammation; therefore their therapeutic potential is being explored in clinical trials. Poor engraftment of infused MSC limits their therapeutic utility; this may be caused by MSC processing before infusion, in particular the method of their detachment from culture. Methods. Enzymatic methods of detaching MSC (Accutase and TrypLE) were compared with non-enzymatic methods (Cell Dissociation Buffer [CDB], ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and scraping) for their effect on MSC viability, chemokine receptor expression, multi-potency, immunomodulation and chemokine-dependent migration. Results. TrypLE detachment preserved MSC viability and tri-lineage potential compared with non-enzymatic methods; however, this resulted in near complete loss of surface chemokine receptor expression. Of the non-enzymatic methods, CDB detachment preserved the highest viability while retaining significant tri-lineage differentiation potential. Once re-plated, CDB-detached MSC regained their original morphology and reached confluence, unlike with the use of other non-enzymatic methods. Viability was significantly reduced with the use of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and further reduced with the use of cell scraping. Addition of 1% serum during CDB detachment led to higher MSC numbers entering autophagy and increased MSC recovery after re-plating. TrypLE and CDB-detached MSC suppressed CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell proliferation, although TrypLE-detached MSC exhibited superior suppression at 1:20 ratio. CDB detachment retained surface chemokine receptor expression and consequently increased migration to CCL22, CXCL12 and CCL4, in contrast with TrypLE-detached MSC. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that non-enzymatic detachment of MSC with the use of CDB minimizes the negative impact on cell viability, multipotency and immunomodulation while retaining chemokine-dependent migration, which may be of importance in MSC delivery and engraftment in sites of injury.

Functional Profiling of Chondrogenically Induced Multipotent Stromal Cell Aggregates Reveals Transcriptomic and Emergent Morphological Phenotypes Predictive of Differentiation Capacity	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE												Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for bone and cartilage tissue repair strategies. However, the functional heterogeneity of MSCs derived from different donors and manufacturing conditions has limited clinical translation, emphasizing the need for improved methods to assess MSC chondrogenic capacity. We used functionally relevant morphological profiling to dynamically monitor emergent morphological phenotypes of chondrogenically induced MSC aggregates to identify morphological features indicative of MSC chondrogenesis. Toward this goal, we characterized the morphology of chondrogenically stimulated MSC aggregates from eight different human cell-lines at multiple passages and demonstrated that MSC aggregates exhibited unique morphological dynamics that were both cell line- and passage-dependent. This variation in 3D morphology was shown to be informative of long-term MSC chondrogenesis based on multiple quantitative functional assays. We found that the specific morphological features of spheroid area, radius, minimum feret diameter, and minor axis length to be strongly correlated with MSC chondrogenic synthetic activity but not gene expression as early as day 4 in 3D culture. Our high-throughput, nondestructive approach could potentially serve as a tool to identify MSC lines with desired chondrogenic capacity toward improving manufacturing strategies for MSC-based cellular products for cartilage tissue repair.

BMSCs are chemotactically guided towards the cancer cells and contribute to the formation of a cancer microenvironment. The homing of BMSCs was affected by various factors. Disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in distant organs, especially in the bone marrow, are the source of cancer metastasis and cancer relapse. DTC survival is also determined by the microenvironment. Here we aim to elucidate how cancer-educated BMSCs promote the survival of cancer cells at primary tumour sites and distant sites. We highlight the dynamic change by identifying different gene expression signatures in intratumoral BMSCs and in BMSCs that move back in the bone marrow. Intratumoral BMSCs acquire high mobility and displayed immunosuppressive effects. Intratumoral BMSCs that ultimately home to the bone marrow exhibit a strong immunosuppressive function. Cancer-educated BMSCs promote the survival of lung cancer cells via expansion of MDSCs in bone marrow, primary tumour sites and metastatic sites. These Ly6G(+) MDSCs suppress proliferation of T cells. CXCL5, nitric oxide and GM-CSF produced by cancer-educated BMSCs contribute to the formation of malignant microenvironments. Treatment with CXCL5 antibody, the iNOS inhibitor 1400w and GM-CSF antibody reduced MDSC expansion in the bone marrow, primary tumour sites and metastatic sites, and promoted the efficiency of PD-L1 antibody. Our study reveals that cancer-educated BMSCs are the component of the niche for primary lung cancer cells and DTCs, and that they can be the target for immunotherapy.																	2041-4889					DEC 9	2019	10								941	10.1038/s41419-019-2149-1							WOS:000502975000008	31819035

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play important roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stemness maintenance of CSCs remain largely unknown. In the present study, through real-time PCR, western blotting, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that miR-217 expression was markedly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-217 promoted, while silencing miR-217 suppressed, the fraction of the side population and the expression of cancer stem cell factors in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo in HCC cells. Our findings further demonstrated that miR-217 promoted the CSC-like phenotype via dickkopf-1 (DKK1) targeting, resulting in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were antagonized by the upregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-overexpressing cells. Conversely, the inhibitory effects of silencing miR-217 on stem cell properties and Wnt signaling were reversed by the downregulation of DKK1 in miR-217-downregulated cells. Therefore, our results indicate that miR-217 plays a vital role in the CSC-like phenotypes of HCC cells and may be used as a potential therapeutic target against HCC.

J	Patenaude, J; Perreault, C				Patenaude, Julien; Perreault, Claude			Thymic Mesenchymal Cells Have a Distinct Transcriptomic Profile	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY												In order to understand the role of mesenchymal cells (MCs) in the adult thymus, we performed whole transcriptome analyses of primary thymic, bone, and skin MCs. These three MC populations shared expression of 2850 core MC genes involved in generic processes including interactions with tissue-resident macrophages. Moreover, we discovered that 2036 genes were differentially expressed, by at least 5-fold, in the three MC populations. Genes preferentially expressed in thymic MCs are instrumental in clearance of apoptotic thymocytes by macrophages, maintenance of a noninflammatory milieu, and attraction-expansion of thymocyte progenitors. Thymic and bone MCs share other sets of differentially expressed genes implicated in resolution of inflammation and expansion of hematolymphoid progenitors. Consistent with the fact that thymic and skin MCs have to support epithelial cells, they express at higher levels genes mediating epithelial cell adhesion to basement membrane and mesenchymal-epithelial cross-talk. Differentially expressed genes preferentially expressed by bone MCs are connected to formation and remodeling of bone, whereas those preferentially expressed in skin MCs are involved in skin and hair follicle homeostasis. We conclude that MCs from different organs display substantial heterogeneity and that the transcriptome of thymic MCs is exquisitely suited for interactions with epithelial and hematolymphoid cells in an environment with a high apoptosis rate.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are implicated in both treatment resistance and disease relapse, and the molecular bases of their malignant properties are still poorly understood. Here we show that both normal stem cells and CSCs of the breast are controlled by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Mechanistically, following interaction with Pin1, Notch1 and Notch4, key regulators of cell fate, escape from proteasomal degradation by their major ubiquitin-ligase Fbxw7 alpha. Functionally, we show that Fbxw7 alpha acts as an essential negative regulator of breast CSCs' expansion by restraining Notch activity, but the establishment of a Notch/Pin1 active circuitry opposes this effect, thus promoting breast CSCs self-renewal, tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In human breast cancers, despite Fbxw7 alpha expression, high levels of Pin1 sustain Notch signaling, which correlates with poor prognosis. Suppression of Pin1 holds promise in reverting aggressive phenotypes, through CSC exhaustion as well as recovered drug sensitivity carrying relevant implications for therapy of breast cancers.

They have immunomodulatory properties and secrete supportive proteins. However, the functional properties of MSCs vary according to many factors such as donor characteristics, tissue origin, or isolation methods. To counteract this heterogeneity, we aimed to immortalize and characterize adherent cells derived from human pancreatic islets (hISCs), using phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional analysis. Methods Adherent cells derived from human islets in culture were infected with a hTERT retrovirus vector and then characterized by microarray hybridization, flow cytometry analysis, and immunofluorescence assays. Osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation as well as PBMC proliferation suppression assays were used to compare the functional abilities of hISCs and MSCs. Extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression profile analysis was performed using the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) software, and protein expression was confirmed by western blotting. Results hISCs kept an unlimited proliferative potential. They exhibited several properties of MSCs such as CD73, CD90, and CD105 expression and differentiation capacity. From a functional point of view, hISCs inhibited the proliferation of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The transcriptomic profile of hISCs highly clusterized with bone marrow (BM)-MSCs and revealed a differential enrichment of genes involved in the organization of the ECM. Indeed, the expression and secretion profiles of ECM proteins including collagens I, IV, and VI, fibronectin, and laminins, known to be expressed in abundance around and within the islets, were different between hISCs and BM-MSCs. Conclusion We generated a new human cell line from pancreatic islets, with MSCs properties and retaining some pancreatic specificities related to the production of ECM proteins. hISCs appear as a very promising tool in islet transplantation by their availability (as a source of inexhaustible source of cells) and ability to secrete a supportive "pancreatic" microenvironment.

Replacing damaged myocardium	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY					25th IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics	JAN 10-14, 2007	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE				Heart failure survival after diagnosis has barely changed for more than half a century. Recently, investigation has focused on differentiation of stem cells in vitro and their delivery for use in vivo as replacement cardiac contractile elements. Here we report preliminary results using mesenchymal stem cells partially differentiated to a cardiac lineage in vitro. When delivered to the canine heart on an extracellular matrix patch to replace a full-thickness ventricular defect in vivo, they improve regional mechanical function. The delivered cells were also tracked, and some became myocytes with mature sarcomeres. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL												Total hip arthroplasty (THA) represents one of the commonest surgical procedures in the orthopedic field. Osteointegration of the implant with native bone is essential for an optimal result; thus, the quality of the patient's bone surrounding the implant (i.e., the bone stock) is crucial. However, in some cases, the bone stock is insufficient and needs to be improved with autologous grafts rich in multipotent cells (i.e., from the iliac crest, from the head of the femur, or from the subchondral bone harvested from the acetabulum) or allogenic frozen bone. It is not known if the harvesting site may influence the osteogenic potential of these cells. Thus, our aim was to characterize and compare multipotent cells collected from the bone marrow, acetabular subchondral bone, and trabecular bone on the femoral head with a focus on osteogenic differentiation. The cells from three sources had a fibroblast-like phenotype and expressed surface antigens CD73, CD90, and CD105 and are negative to CD11b, CD34, and CD45. Although all these cells could be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, they displayed different differentiation potentials. In osteogenic differentiation condition, the cells from the acetabulum had the lowest accumulation of calcium deposit while the cells originated from the bone marrow and femur created a considerably increased amount of the deposit. These findings were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In chondrogenic and adipogenic conditions, bone marrow cells possessed a predominant differential capacity compared with the others, illustrated by high collagen type II expression together with a cartilage-like lacuna structure and the presence of fat-specific markers, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing and demonstrating that the progenitor cells obtained from diverse surgical sites in hip replacement procedure share common characteristics of MSC but differ about plasticity and may provide rational for clinical application in cell therapy and bone grafting. The project number L1033 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03369457.				mangiavini, laura/K-6340-2016; Peretti, Giuseppe/K-6358-2016; Nguyen, Thi Van/M-8618-2018; Tessaro, Irene/I-7137-2017; marmotti, antonio/R-6766-2018	mangiavini, laura/0000-0003-1892-1249; Peretti, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9341-7187; Nguyen, Thi Van/0000-0003-2683-4591; Tessaro, Irene/0000-0003-0770-7458; marmotti, antonio/0000-0002-1683-6094												1687-966X	1687-9678					2019	2019								9178436	10.1155/2019/9178436							WOS:000473465200001	31191688

Background The favorable effects of MSC therapy in myocardial infarction (MI) are complex and not fully understood. Methods We induced MI in mice and allocated them to bone marrow MSCs, mononuclear cells, or saline injection into the infarct, with and without early (4 h before MI) and late (3 days after MI) macrophage depletion. We then analyzed macrophage phenotype in the infarcted heart by flow cytometry and macrophage secretome in vitro. Left ventricular remodeling and global and regional function were assessed by echocardiography and speckle-tracking based strain imaging. Results The MSC therapy significantly increased the percentage of reparative M2 macrophages (F4/80(+)CD206(+)) in the infarcted myocardium, compared with mononuclear-and saline-treated hearts, 3 and 4 days after MI. Macrophage cytokine secretion, relevant to infarct healing and repair, was significantly increased after MSC therapy, or incubation with MSCs or MSC supernatant. Significantly, with and without MSC therapy, transient macrophage depletion increased mortality 30 days after MI. Furthermore, early macrophage depletion produced the greatest negative effect on infarct size and left ventricular remodeling and function, as well as a significant incidence of left ventricular thrombus formation. These deleterious effects were attenuated with macrophage restoration and MSC therapy. Conclusions Some of the protective effects of MSCs on infarct repair are mediated by macrophages, which are essential for early healing and repair. Thus, targeting macrophages could be a novel strategy to improve infarct healing and repair.

Heterogeneity arises due to the genetic and epigenetic variation of tumor cells in response to microenvironmental interactions and cytotoxic therapy. We explored specific signaling pathway activation in glioblastoma (GBM) by investigating the intratumor activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. We present data demonstrating a striking preponderance for mutual exclusivity of MAPK and PI3K activation in GBM tissue, where MAPK activation correlates with proliferation and transcription factor CREB activation and PI3K activation correlates with CD44 expression. Bioinformatic analysis of signaling and CREB-regulated target genes supports the immunohistochemical data, showing that the MAPK-CREB activation correlates with proliferative regions. In-silico analysis suggests that MAPK-CREB signaling activates a pro-inflammatory molecular signature and correlates with a mesenchymal GBM subtype profile, while PI3K-CREB activation correlates with the proneural GBM subtype and a tumor cell invasive gene signature. Overall, the data suggests the existence of intratumor subtype heterogeneity in GBM and that using combinations of both MAPK and PI3K drug inhibitors is necessary for effective targeted therapy.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, are responsible for cancer initiation, metastasis, drug resistance and relapse, accounting for the heterogeneous and hierarchical organizations of HCC. Therefore, CSCs are novel targets for more efficient liver cancer therapies. New data continues to mount on the functions of noncoding RNAs in multiple processes of liver CSCs, including malignant proliferation, self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and survival. Thus, it is highly critical to develop improved understanding of the mechanisms by which noncoding RNAs control CSCs functions for developing better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Herein, we will shed light on the regulatory roles of noncoding RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs), in liver CSCs acquisition and maintenance after presenting an overview about the characteristics of liver CSCs and their origins.

Assessing the potential of colony morphology for dissecting the CFU-F population from human bone marrow stromal cells	CELL AND TISSUE RESEARCH												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide an ideal cell source for bone tissue engineering strategies. However, bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) populations that contain MSCs are highly heterogeneous expressing a wide variety of proliferative and differentiation potentials. Current MSC isolation methods employing magnetic-activated and fluorescent-activated cell sorting can be expensive and time consuming and, in the absence of specific MSC markers, fail to generate homogeneous populations. We have investigated the potential of various colony morphology descriptors to provide correlations with cell growth potential. Density-independent colony forming unit-fibroblastic (CFU-F) capacity is a MSC prerequisite and resultant colonies display an array of shapes and sizes that might be representative of cell function. Parent colonies were initially categorised according to their diameter and cell density and grouped before passage for the subsequent assessment of progeny colonies. Whereas significant morphological differences between distinct parent populations indicated a correlation with immunophenotype, enhanced CFU-F capacity was not observed when individual colonies were isolated according to these morphological parameters. Colony circularity, an alternative morphological measure, displayed a strong correlation with subsequent cell growth potential. The current study indicates the potential of morphological descriptors for predicting cell growth rate and suggests new directions for research into dissection of human BMSC CFU-F populations.

J	Garg, M				Garg, Minal			Epithelial Plasticity, Autophagy and Metastasis: Potential Modifiers of the Crosstalk to Overcome Therapeutic Resistance	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiates malignant transformation of cancer cells and is responsible for the generation of heterogenic subsets of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Signals in the form of environmental cues and paracrine factors within tumor microenvironment (TME) niche, support the possibility of generation of pool of CSCs with two distinct functional transition states. Cyclic CSCs with predominant epithelial phenotype, self-renew and differentiate into mature cancer cells. Subsets of autophagic/ non-cyclic CSCs with predominant mesenchymal phenotype have capacity to invade, metastasize, resist to apoptosis, escape immunosurveillance, survive chemotherapies and are majorly responsible for cancer mortality. Differences in phenotypic plasticity may form the basis of differential impact of therapeutic outcomes on heterogeneous subpopulations of CSCs. Activation of autophagy is responsible for the recycling of damaged organelles and protein aggregates, regulates EMT, confers the survival advantage to neoplastic cells to anti-cancer therapies, significantly affects the invasive potential of cancer cells and supports their metastatic dissemination in a tissue and tumor stage dependent manner. Therapy resistance is the primary obstacle in the complete ablation of tumor cells. Combinational treatments based on targeting autophagic CSCs and inhibiting EMT regulators may represent potential anticancer strategies for the prevention of cancer invasion, metastatic spread and disease relapse.																	2629-3269	2629-3277				JUN	2020	16	3					503	510		10.1007/s12015-019-09945-9		MAR 2020					WOS:000518468400001	32125607

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that confers invasive and migratory capabilities as well as stem cell properties to carcinoma cells thus promoting metastatic progression. In this work, we examined the impact of hypoxia on EMT-associated cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, by culturing transformed human mammary epithelial cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and applying in silico mathematical modelling to simulate the impact of hypoxia on the acquisition of CSC attributes and the transitions between differentiated and stem-like states. Our results indicate that both the heterogeneity and the plasticity of the transformed cell population are enhanced by exposure to hypoxia, resulting in a shift towards a more stem-like population with increased EMT features. Our findings are further reinforced by gene expression analyses demonstrating the upregulation of EMT-related genes, as well as genes associated with therapy resistance, in hypoxic cells compared to normoxic counterparts. In conclusion, we demonstrate that mathematical modelling can be used to simulate the role of hypoxia as a key contributor to the plasticity and heterogeneity of transformed human mammary epithelial cells.

Elucidating the cellular actions of demineralised dentine matrix extract on a clonal dental pulp stem cell population in orchestrating dental tissue repair	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING												Bioactive growth factors identified within the extracellular matrix of dentine have been proposed roles in regulating the naturally inherent regenerative dentine formation seen in teeth in response to trauma and infection, which may also be harnessed for novel clinical treatments in augmenting mineralised tissue repair. This study examined the specific biological action of demineralised dentine matrix extract on a clonal population of dental pulp stem cells in stimulating the prerequisite stages of wound healing associated with mineralised tissue repair. A clonal dental pulp stem cell population with sustained proliferative capacity and multi-potentiality towards osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages was isolated from the pulp of human third molars. Dentine was collected from human healthy teeth, powdered and treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to obtain a solubilised DDM protein extract. The influence of DDM on the DPSC clonal population was assessed in vitro. Exposure of cells to proteolytically degraded DDM or unsupplemented media served as controls. Compared to controls, DDM stimulated cell expansion, reduced apoptotic marker caspase 3, increased cell survival marker Akt1 and enhanced mineralised matrix deposition as determined by mineral deposition and increased expression of bone-related markers, alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin. Dental pulp stem cells successfully migrated into collagen gels supplemented with demineralised dentine matrix, with cells remaining viable and expanding in numbers over a 3-day period. Collectively, the results provide evidence that soluble proteins extracted from dentine matrix are able to exert a direct biological effect on dental pulp stem cells in promoting mineralised tissue repair mechanisms.

Modeling Pathogenesis of Primary Liver Cancer in Lineage-Specific Mouse Cell Types	GASTROENTEROLOGY												BACKGROUND & AIMS: Human primary liver cancer is classified into biologically distinct subgroups based on cellular origin. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been recently described. We investigated the ability of distinct lineages of hepatic cells to become liver CSCs and the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of primary liver cancer. METHODS: We transduced mouse primary hepatic progenitor cells, lineage-committed hepatoblasts, and differentiated adult hepatocytes with transgenes encoding oncogenic H-Ras and SV40LT. The CSC properties of transduced cells and their ability to form tumors were tested by standard in vitro and in vivo assays and transcriptome profiling. RESULTS: Irrespective of origin, all transduced cells acquired markers of CSC/progenitor cells, side populations, and self-renewal capacity in vitro. They also formed a broad spectrum of liver tumors, ranging from cholangiocarcinoma to hepatocellular carcinoma, which resembled human liver tumors, based on genomic and histologic analyses. The tumor cells coexpressed hepatocyte (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha), progenitor/biliary (keratin 19, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, A6), and mesenchymal (vimentin) markers and showed dysregulation of genes that control the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Gene expression analyses could distinguish tumors of different cellular origin, indicating the contribution of lineage stage-dependent genetic changes to malignant transformation. Activation of c-Myc and its target genes was required to reprogram adult hepatocytes into CSCs and for tumors to develop. Stable knockdown of c-Myc in transformed adult hepatocytes reduced their CSC properties in vitro and suppressed growth of tumors in immunodeficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Any cell type in the mouse hepatic lineage can undergo oncogenic reprogramming into a CSC by activating different cell type-specific pathways. Identification of common and cell of origin-specific phenotypic and genetic changes could provide new therapeutic targets for liver cancer.

Our analysis identifies three major cell populations representing the smooth muscle cells and two types of fibroblast cells enriched by Sca-1 and CD90. The Sca-1(+)CD90(+) fibroblast cells are in direct contact with the epithelial cells and express growth factors and genes associated with cell motility, developmental process, and androgen biosynthesis. This suggests that they may regulate epithelial cell survival and growth. The Sca-1(+)CD90(-/low) myofibro-blast-like cells highly express genes associated with the extracellular matrix and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, indicating a role in tissue repair and immune responses. The Sca-1(+)CD90(-/low) cells significantly suppress the capacity of the basal cells for bipotent differentiation in the prostate organoid assay. Collectively, we identify the surface markers enabling physical separation of stromal subpopulations and generate the gene expression profiles implying their cellular functions.																		2589-0042				MAR 29	2019	13						328	+		10.1016/j.isci.2019.02.032							WOS:000462829500027	30878879

It causes approximately 125,000 deaths per year worldwide; its diagnosis is made in advanced stages resulting in a high mortality rate. The objective of the study was optimizing the isolation of cells obtained from the solid tumor and ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian cancer and the phenotype with markers related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. For this, the solid tumor tissue was disaggregated and cultivated with different methodologies. As a result, cell growth was obtained and epi-immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies against E-cadherin, EpCAM, N-cadherin, vimentin, CD133, and CD44. The primary culture from the solid tumor was obtained using Dispase II and DMEM/F12. Finally, heterogeneity was detected in terms of the expression of mesenchymal and epithelial type markers in the two types of isolated cells. Additionally, CD133 and CD44 expression was detected, proteins associated with the tumor stem cells phenotype.

The hematopoietic stem cell niche in homeostasis and disease	BLOOD												The bone marrow microenvironment contains a heterogeneous population of stromal cells organized into niches that support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and other lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors. The stem cell niche generates signals that regulate HSC self-renewal, quiescence, and differentiation. Here, we review recent studies that highlight the heterogeneity of the stromal cells that comprise stem cell niches and the complexity of the signals that they generate. We highlight emerging data that stem cell niches in the bone marrow are not static but instead are responsive to environmental stimuli. Finally, we review recent data showing that hematopoietic niches are altered in certain hematopoietic malignancies, and we discuss how these alterations might contribute to disease pathogenesis.

Therefore, the development of new therapies, specifically directed against GBM CSCs, constitutes an important research avenue. Considering the extended range of cancer-related pathways modulated by histone acetylation/deacetylation processes, we studied the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic efficacy of givinostat (GVS), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, on cell cultures enriched in CSCs, isolated from nine human GBMs. We report that GVS induced a significant reduction of viability and self-renewal ability in all GBM CSC cultures; conversely, GVS exposure did not cause a significant cytotoxic activity toward differentiated GBM cells and normal mesenchymal human stem cells. Analyzing the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, we demonstrated that GVS affected CSC viability through the activation of programmed cell death pathways. In particular, a marked stimulation of macroautophagy was observed after GVS treatment. To understand the functional link between GVS treatment and autophagy activation, different genetic and pharmacological interfering strategies were used. We show that the up-regulation of the autophagy process, obtained by deprivation of growth factors, induced a reduction of CSC sensitivity to GVS, while the pharmacological inhibition of the autophagy pathway and the silencing of the key autophagy gene ATG7, increased the cell death rate induced by GVS. Altogether these findings suggest that autophagy represents a pro survival mechanism activated by GBM CSCs to counteract the efficacy of the anti-proliferative activity of GVS. In conclusion, we demonstrate that GVS is a novel pharmacological tool able to target GBM CSC viability and its efficacy can be enhanced by autophagy inhibitory strategies.

Differential propagation of stroma and cancer stem cells dictates tumorigenesis and multipotency	ONCOGENE												Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is characterized by high cancer cell heterogeneity and the presence of a complex tumor microenvironment. Those factors are a key obstacle for the treatment of this tumor type. To model the disease in mice, the current strategy is to grow GBM cells in serum-free non-adherent condition, which maintains their tumor-initiating potential. However, the so-generated tumors are histologically different from the one of origin. In this work, we performed high-throughput marker expression analysis and investigated the tumorigenicity of GBM cells enriched under different culture conditions. We identified a marker panel that distinguished tumorigenic sphere cultures from non-tumorigenic serum cultures (high CD56, SOX2, SOX9, and low CD105, CD248, aSMA). Contrary to previous work, we found that 'mixed cell cultures' grown in serum conditions are tumorigenic and express cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. As well, 1% serum plus bFGF and TGF-alpha preserved the tumorigenicity of sphere cultures and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition gene expression. Furthermore, we identified 12 genes that could replace the 840 genes of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) used for GBM-subtyping. Our data suggest that the tumorigenicity of GBM cultures depend on cell culture strategies that retain CSCs in culture rather than the presence of serum in the cell culture medium.

J	Ghosh, Z; Mallick, B				Ghosh, Zhumur; Mallick, Bibekanand			Cancer Stem Cells and Regulatory RNAs Crosstalk: Fostering Possibilities for Cancer Therapies	BIOSCIENCE												Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to be responsible for tumor initiation, therapy resistance, progression, relapse, and metastasis. Despite their potential clinical importance, their mode of regulation at the molecular level is poorly understood. This is somewhat because of substantial variation of the CSC phenotype between patients and functional heterogeneity in tumors harboring genetically distinct CSCs. Regulatory noncoding RNAs (rncRNAs) are emerging as new players in the CSC paradigm. They contribute to maintaining the CSC niche. Here, we discuss rncRNAs that are associated or likely to have an association with CSCs and that control the genetic program that specifies CSC identity and properties. These rncRNAs are also involved in the epigenetic modification of these cells. Moreover, CSC-specific oncogenic and tumor suppressor rncRNAs may serve as novel therapeutic targets, which suggest their potential importance in clinical decisionmaking. Their study will further facilitate the discovery of RNA-based novel therapies and therapeutic targets specific to CSCs.

Alejandro			In Vitro Analysis of Breast Cancer Cell Line Tumourspheres and Primary Human Breast Epithelia Mammospheres Demonstrates Inter- and Intrasphere Heterogeneity	PLOS ONE												Mammosphere and breast tumoursphere culture have gained popularity as in vitro assays for propagating and analysing normal and cancer stem cells. Whether the spheres derived from different sources or parent cultures themselves are indeed single entities enriched in stem/progenitor cells compared to other culture formats has not been fully determined. We surveyed sphere-forming capacity across 26 breast cell lines, immunophenotyped spheres from six luminal- and basal-like lines by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry and compared clonogenicity between sphere, adherent and matrigel culture formats using in vitro functional assays. Analyses revealed morphological and molecular intra- and inter-sphere heterogeneity, consistent with adherent parental cell line phenotypes. Flow cytometry showed sphere culture does not universally enrich for markers previously associated with stem cell phenotypes, although we found some cell-line specific changes between sphere and adherent formats. Sphere-forming efficiency was significantly lower than adherent or matrigel clonogenicity and constant over serial passage. Surprisingly, self-renewal capacity of sphere-derived cells was similar/lower than other culture formats. We observed significant correlation between long-term-proliferating-cell symmetric division rates in sphere and adherent cultures, suggesting functional overlap between the compartments sustaining them. Experiments with normal primary human mammary epithelia, including sorted luminal (MUC1(+)) and basal/myoepithelial (CD10(+)) cells revealed distinct luminal-like, basal-like and mesenchymal entities amongst primary mammospheres. Morphological and colony-forming-cell assay data suggested mammosphere culture may enrich for a luminal progenitor phenotype, or induce reversion/relaxation of the basal/mesenchymal in vitro selection occurring with adherent culture. Overall, cell line tumourspheres and primary mammospheres are not homogenous entities enriched for stem cells, suggesting a more cautious approach to interpreting data from these assays and careful consideration of its limitations. Sphere culture may represent an alternative 3-dimensional culture system which rather than universally 'enriching' for stem cells, has utility as one of a suite of functional assays that provide a read-out of progenitor activity.

However, most studies rely on interfacing a population of cells in a tissue-scale bulk hydrogel, an approach that overlooks the heterogeneity of local matrix deposition around individual cells. A droplet microfluidic technique to deposit a defined amount of 3D hydrogel matrices around single cells independently of material composition, elasticity, and stress relaxation times is developed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) undergo isotropic volume expansion more rapidly in thinner gels that present an Arg-Gly-Asp integrin ligand. Mathematical modeling and experiments show that MSCs experience higher membrane tension as they expand in thinner gels. Furthermore, thinner gels facilitate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. By modulating ion channels, it is shown that isotropic volume expansion of single cells predicts intracellular tension and stem cell fate. The results suggest the utility of precise microscale gel deposition to control single cell functions.

To study this question, we analyzed two distinct isogenic MSC populations isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB1 and UCB2). The use of isogenic populations eliminated differences contributed by genetic background. We characterized these UCB MSCs for cell morphology, growth kinetics, immunophenotype, and potential for differentiation. UCB1 displayed faster growth kinetics, higher population doublings, and increased adipogenic lineage differentiation compared to UCB2. However, osteogenic differentiation was stronger for the UCB2 population. To identify MSC-specific genes and developmental genes associated with observed phenotypic differences, we performed expression analysis using Affymetrix microarrays and compared them to bone marrow (BM) MSCs. We compared UCB1, UCB2, and BM and identified distinct gene expression patterns. Selected clusters were analyzed demonstrating that genes of multiple developmental pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and wnt genes, and markers of early embryonic stages and mesodermal differentiation displayed significant differences among the MSC populations. In undifferentiated UCB1 cells, multiple genes were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.0001): peroxisome proliferation activated receptor gamma (PPARG), which correlated with adipogenic differentiation capacities, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1/CXCL12), which could both potentially contribute to the higher growth kinetics observed in UCB1 cells. Overall, the results confirmed the presence of two distinct isogenic UCB-derived cell populations, identified gene profiles useful to distinguish MSC types with different lineage differentiation potentials, and helped clarify the heterogeneity observed in these cells.

Oxygen concentration has been shown to influence the functions of MSCs, as well as other normal and malignant stem cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of hypoxic responses and the precise role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha), the master regulatory protein of hypoxia, in MSCs remain unclear, due to the limited span of Hif-1 alpha stabilization and the complex network of hypoxic responses. In this study, to further define the significance of Hif-1 alpha in MSC function during their self-renewal and terminal differentiation, we established adult bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs that are able to sustain high level expression of ubiquitin-resistant Hif-1 alpha during such long-term biological processes. Using this model, we show that the stabilization of Hif-1 alpha proteins exerts a selective influence on colony-forming mesenchymal progenitors promoting their self-renewal and proliferation, without affecting the proliferation of the MSC mass population. Moreover, Hif-1 alpha stabilization in MSCs led to the induction of pluripotent genes (oct-4 and klf-4) and the inhibition of their terminal differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. These results provide insights into the previously unrecognized roles of Hif-1 alpha proteins in maintaining the primitive state of primary MSCs and on the cellular heterogeneities in hypoxic responses among MSC populations.																	1226-3613	2092-6413				SEP	2013	45								e44	10.1038/emm.2013.87							WOS:000328123100006	24071737

Paracrine orchestration of intestinal tumorigenesis by a mesenchymal niche	NATURE												The initiation of an intestinal tumour is a probabilistic process that depends on the competition between mutant and normal epithelial stem cells in crypts(1). Intestinal stem cells are closely associated with a diverse but poorly characterized network of mesenchymal cell types(2,3). However, whether the physiological mesenchymal microenvironment of mutant stem cells affects tumour initiation remains unknown. Here we provide in vivo evidence that the mesenchymal niche controls tumour initiation in trans. By characterizing the heterogeneity of the intestinal mesenchyme using single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified a population of rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts that constitutively process arachidonic acid into highly labile prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)). Specific ablation of Ptgs2 in fibroblasts was sufficient to prevent tumour initiation in two different models of sporadic, autochthonous tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of a mesenchymal niche model showed that fibroblast-derived PGE(2) drives the expansion omicron f a population of Sca-1(+) reserve-like stem cells. These express a strong regenerative/tumorigenic program, driven by the Hippo pathway effector Yap. In vivo, Yap is indispensable for Sca-1(+) cell expansion and early tumour initiation and displays a nuclear localization in both mouse and human adenomas. Using organoid experiments, we identified a molecular mechanism whereby PGE(2) promotes Yap dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity by signalling through the receptor Ptger4. Epithelial-specific ablation of Ptger4 misdirected the regenerative reprogramming of stem cells and prevented Sca-1(+) cell expansion and sporadic tumour initiation in mutant mice, thereby demonstrating the robust paracrine control of tumour-initiating stem cells by PGE(2)-Ptger4. Analyses of patient-derived organoids established that PGE(2)-PTGER4 also regulates stem-cell function in humans. Our study demonstrates that initiation of colorectal cancer is orchestrated by the mesenchymal niche and reveals a mechanism by which rare pericryptal Ptgs2-expressing fibroblasts exert paracrine control over tumour-initiating stem cells via the druggable PGE(2)-Ptger4-Yap signalling axis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of intestinal mesenchyme identified a population of fibroblasts that produce prostaglandin E-2, which, when disrupted, prevented initiation of intestinal tumours.

Here, we show that adverse prognosis associated with epigenetic silencing of the tumour suppressor RASSF1A is due to increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), tumour stiffness and metastatic dissemination in vitro and in vivo. We find that lung cancer cells with RASSF1A promoter methylation display constitutive nuclear YAP1 accumulation and expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha-2 (P4HA2) which increases collagen deposition. Furthermore, we identify that elevated collagen creates a stiff ECM which in turn triggers cancer stem-like programming and metastatic dissemination in vivo. Re-expression of RASSF1A or inhibition of P4HA2 activity reverses these effects and increases markers of lung differentiation (TTF-1 and Mucin 5B). Our study identifies RASSF1A as a clinical biomarker associated with mechanical properties of ECM which increases the levels of cancer stemness and risk of metastatic progression in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, we highlight P4HA2 as a potential target for uncoupling ECM signals that support cancer stemness.

Methods The search strategy included the PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CKNI) databases. The endpoint was the ratio of vascular neointima/media (I/M). Moreover, neointimal area, re-endothelialization, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression were analyzed. Pooled analyses were conducted using random effects models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also explored. All data were analyzed using RevMan 5.2 and Stata 12.0. Results Fifteen studies were reviewed from 238 retrieved animal studies. Compared with controls, MSC transplantation resulted in greater I/M reduction (pooled difference, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.57-0.21; P < 0.0001), greater neointimal area reduction (pooled difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.22-0.10; P < 0.0001), decreased PCNA expression (pooled difference, 17.69; 95% CI, 28.94-6.44; P = 0.002), and enhanced re-endothelialization (pooled difference, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.78-4.95; P < 0.0001). The multivariable meta-regression analysis showed that a higher number of transplanted cells (> 10(6); P = 0.017) and later time point of I/M measurement (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with I/M reduction. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a trend for a greater reduction in the ratio of I/M with late MSC transplantation (> 1 day), MSCs transplanted through intravenous injection, and atherosclerotic vessels. Conclusion The meta-analysis results demonstrate that MSC transplantation might improve injured vascular remodeling. In addition to greater efficacy with a greater number of transplanted MSCs (> 10(6)), the long-term effect of MSC transplantation appears to be more significant. The findings of this meta-analysis may help to design future, effective MSC trials.																	1932-6203					MAR 26	2015	10	3							e0120082	10.1371/journal.pone.0120082							WOS:000356353700036	25811171

Its high sulfation degree mediates functional interactions with positively charged amino acids in proteins. 2-O sulfation of iduronic acid and 3-O sulfation of glucosamine in HS are mediated by the sulfotransferases HS2ST and HS3ST, respectively, which are dysregulated in several cancers. Both sulfotransferases regulate breast cancer cell viability and invasion, but their role in cancer stem cells (CSCs) is unknown. Breast CSCs express characteristic markers such as CD44(+)/CD24(-/low), CD133 and ALDH1 and are involved in tumor initiation, formation, and recurrence. We studied the influence of HS2ST1 and HS3ST2 overexpression on the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cell lines representative of the triple-negative (MDA-MB-231) and hormone-receptor positive subtype (MCF-7). The CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)phenotype was significantly reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells after overexpression of both enzymes, remaining unaltered in MCF-7 cells. ALDH1 activity was increased after HS2ST1 and HS3ST2 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 cells and reduced after HS2ST1 overexpression in MCF-7 cells. Colony and spheroid formation were increased after HS2ST1 and HS3ST2 overexpression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing HS2ST1 formed more colonies and could not generate spheres. The phenotypic changes were associated with complex changes in the expression of the stemness-associated notch and Wnt-signaling pathways constituents, syndecans, heparanase and Sulf1. The results improve our understanding of breast CSC function and mark a subtype-specific impact of HS modifications on the CSC phenotype of triple-negative and hormone receptor positive breast cancer model cell lines.

Regenerative Potential and Inflammation-Induced Secretion Profile of Human Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Cells Are Influenced by Donor Variability and Prior Breast Cancer Diagnosis	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												Adipose tissue contains a heterogeneous population of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells that work synergistically with resident cell types to enhance tissue healing. Ease of access and processing paired with therapeutic promise make SVF cells an attractive option for autologous applications in regenerative medicine. However, inherent variability in SVF cell therapeutic potential from one patient to another hinders prognosis determination for any one person. This study investigated the regenerative properties and inflammation responses of thirteen, medically diverse human donors. Using non-expanded primary lipoaspirate samples, SVF cells were assessed for robustness of several parameters integral to tissue regeneration, including yield, viability, self-renewal capacity, proliferation, differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory cytokine secretion. Each parameter was selected either for its role in regenerative potential, defined here as the ability to heal tissues through stem cell repopulation and subsequent multipotent differentiation, or for its potential role in wound healing through trophic immunomodulatory activity. These data were then analyzed for consistent and predictable patterns between and across measurements, while also investigating the influence of the donors' relevant medical histories, particularly if the donor was in remission following breast cancer treatment. Analyses identified positive correlations among the expression of three cytokines: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. The expression of these cytokines also positively related to self-renewal capacity. These results are potentially relevant for establishing expectations in both preclinical experiments and targeted clinical treatment strategies that use stem cells from patients with diverse medical histories.

These neoplasms are particularly difficult to treat efficiently because of their highly heterogeneous and resistant characteristics. Advances in genomics have highlighted the complex molecular landscape of these tumors and the need to further develop effective and targeted therapies for each patient. A specific population of cells with enriched stem cell properties within tumors, i.e., glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), drives this cellular heterogeneity and therapeutical resistance, and thus constitutes an attractive target for the design of innovative treatments. However, the signals driving the maintenance and resistance of these cells are still unclear. We provide new findings regarding the expression of two transcription factors in these cells and directly in glioblastoma patient samples. We show that these proteins downregulate GSC growth and ultimately participate in the progression of gliomas. The forthcoming results will contribute to a better understanding of gliomagenesis.<br>Glioblastomas (GBM) are high-grade brain tumors, containing cells with distinct phenotypes and tumorigenic potentials, notably aggressive and treatment-resistant multipotent glioblastoma stem cells (GSC). The molecular mechanisms controlling GSC plasticity and growth have only partly been elucidated. Contact with endothelial cells and the Notch1 pathway control GSC proliferation and fate. We used three GSC cultures and glioma resections to examine the expression, regulation, and role of two transcription factors, SLUG (SNAI2) and TAL1 (SCL), involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), hematopoiesis, vascular identity, and treatment resistance in various cancers. In vitro, SLUG and a truncated isoform of TAL1 (TAL1-PP22) were strongly upregulated upon Notch1 activation in GSC, together with LMO2, a known cofactor of TAL1, which formed a complex with truncated TAL1. SLUG was also upregulated by TGF-1 treatment and by co-culture with endothelial cells. In patient samples, the full-length isoform TAL1-PP42 was expressed in all glioma grades. In contrast, SLUG and truncated TAL1 were preferentially overexpressed in GBMs. SLUG and TAL1 are expressed in the tumor microenvironment by perivascular and endothelial cells, respectively, and to a minor extent, by a fraction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -amplified GBM cells. Mechanistically, both SLUG and truncated TAL1 reduced GSC growth after their respective overexpression. Collectively, this study provides new evidence for the role of SLUG and TAL1 in regulating GSC plasticity and growth.

Methods: Studies of the BBB scores after intravenous transplantation of BMSCs were searched out from Pubmed, SCI, Cochrane Library, Chinese journal full-text database, China Biology Medicinedisc and Wanfang data-base and analyzed by Review Manager 5.2.5. Results: Nine randomized controlled animal trials were selected with 235 rats enrolled. The studies are divided to different subgroups by different models of SCI and different time to transplantion. The results of Meta-analysis in different subgroups both indicated that the rats of experimental group (BMSCs group) got better BBB scores than control group at 1, 3 and over 5 weeks after intravenous transplantation of BMSCs with significant differences. The heterogeneity between impacted injury model and oppressed injury model subgroups decreased with the passage of time (I-2 = 75.8%, 39.7%, 0%). No heterogeneity was found between 3 d and 7 d subgroups. Conclusion: The intravenous transplantation of BMSCs is an efficient way to cure spinal cord injury, which can improve the motor function of rats. The therapeutic window is wide.

Global proteomic signature of undifferentiated human bone marrow stromal cells: Evidence for donor-to-donor proteome heterogeneity	STEM CELL RESEARCH												The clinical application of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) largely depends on their capacity to expand in vitro. We have conducted a comprehensive comparative proteomic analysis of culture-expanded hBMSCs obtained from different human donors. The data reveal extensive donor-to-donor proteomic heterogeneity. Processing and database-searching of the tandem MS data resulted in a most comprehensive to date proteomic dataset for hBMSC. A total of 7753 proteins including 712 transcription and translation regulators, 384 kinases, 248 receptor proteins, and 29 cytokines were confidently identified. The proteins identified are mainly nuclear (43.2%) and the share of proteins assigned to more than one subcellular location constitutes 10% of the identified proteome. Bioinformatics tools (IPA, DAVID, and PANTHER) were used to annotate proteins with respect to cellular locations, functions, and other physicochemical characteristics. We also compared the proteomic profile of hBMSCs to recently compiled datasets for human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. The result shows the extent of similarity between the three cell populations and also identified 253 proteins expressed uniformly by all lines of hBMSCs but not reported in the proteomic datasets of the two pluripotent stem cells. Overall, the proteomic database reported in this paper can serve as a reference map for extensive evaluation of hBMSC to explain their biology as well as identify possible marker candidates for further evaluation.

Of the three, HAS1 is found to be localized more into the cytoplasmic space where it synthesizes intracellular HA. HA is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan, mainly present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and on the cell surface, but are also detected intracellularly. Accumulation of HA in cancer cells, the cancer-surrounding stroma, and ECM is generally considered an independent prognostic factors for patients. Higher HA production also correlates with higher tumor grade and more genetic heterogeneity in multiple cancer types which is known to contribute to drug resistance and results in treatment failure. Tumor heterogeneity and intra-tumor clonal diversity are major challenges for diagnosis and treatment. Identification of the driver pathway(s) that initiate genomic instability, tumor heterogeneity and subsequent phenotypic/clinical manifestations, are fundamental for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Thus far, no evidence was shown to correlate intracellular HA status (produced by HAS1) and the generation of genetic diversity in tumors. Methods: We tested different cell lines engineered to induce HAS1 expression. We measured the epithelial traits, centrosomal abnormalities, micronucleation and polynucleation of those HAS1-expressing cells. We performed real-time PCR, 3D cell culture assay, confocal microscopy, immunoblots and HA-capture methods. Results: Our results demonstrate that overexpression of HAS1 induces loss of epithelial traits, increases centrosomal abnormalities, micronucleation and polynucleation, which together indicate manifestation of malignant transformation, intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, and possibly create suitable niche for cancer stem cells generation. Conclusions: The intracellular HA produced by HAS1 can aggravate genomic instability and intratumor heterogeneity, pointing to a fundamental role of intracellular HA in cancer initiation and progression.

Protein Kinase C alpha Is a Central Signaling Node and Therapeutic Target for Breast Cancer Stem Cells	CANCER CELL												The epithelial-mesenchymal transition program becomes activated during malignant progression and can enrich for cancer stem cells (CSCs). We report that inhibition of protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) specifically targets CSCs but has little effect on non-CSCs. The formation of CSCs from non-stem cells involves a shift from EGFR to PDGFR signaling and results in the PKC alpha-dependent activation of FRA1. We identified an AP-1 molecular switch in which c-FOS and FRA1 are preferentially utilized in non-CSCs and CSCs, respectively. PKC alpha and FRA1 expression is associated with the aggressive triple-negative breast cancers, and the depletion of FRA1 results in a mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Hence, identifying molecular features that shift between cell states can be exploited to target signaling components critical to CSCs.

LENTIVIRAL-BASED REPORTER CONSTRUCTS FOR PROFILING CHONDROGENIC ACTIVITY IN PRIMARY EQUINE CELL POPULATIONS	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS												Successful clinical translation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies for cartilage repair will likely require the implementation of standardised protocols and broadly applicable tools to facilitate the comparisons among cell types and chondroinduction methods. The present study investigated the utility of recombinant lentiviral reporter vectors as reliable tools for comparing chondrogenic potential among primary cell populations and distinguishing cellular-level variations of chondrogenic activity in widely used three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. Primary equine MSCs and chondrocytes were transduced with vectors containing combinations of fluorescent and luciferase reporter genes under constitutive cytomeglavirus (CMV) or chondrocyte-lineage (Col2) promoters. Reporter activity was measured by fluorescence imaging and luciferase assay. In 3D cultures of MSC aggregates and polyethylene glycol-hyaluronic acid (PEG-HA) hydrogels, transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-beta 3)-mediated chondroinduction increased Col2 reporter activity, demonstrating close correlation with histology and mRNA expression levels of COL2A1 and SOX9. Comparison of chondrogenic activities among MSC populations using a secretable luciferase reporter revealed enhanced chondrogenesis in bone-marrow-derived MSCs relative to MSC populations from synovium and adipose tissues. A dual fluorescence reporter - enabling discrimination of highly chondrogenic (Col2-GFP) cells within an MSC population (CMV-tdTomato) - revealed marked heterogeneity in differentiating aggregate cultures and identified chondrogenic cells in chondrocyte-seeded PEG-HA hydrogels after 6 weeks in a subcutaneous implant model - indicating stable, long-term reporter expression in vivo. These results suggested that lentiviral reporter vectors may be used to address fundamental questions regarding chondrogenic activity in chondroprogenitor cell populations and accelerate clinical translation of cell-based cartilage repair strategies.

Due to their unique role in tumor initiation, the interaction between CSCs and stromal cells is especially critical. In this work, we developed a platform to reliably isolate single cells in suspension and grow single-cell-derived spheres for functional enrichment of CSCs. The platform also allows adherent culture of stromal cells for cancer-stromal interaction. As a proof of concept, we grew SUM149 breast cancer cells and successfully formed single-cell-derived spheres. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as stromal cells were found to significantly enhance the formation and growth of cancer spheres, indicating elevated tumor-initiation potential. After on-chip culture for 14 days, we retrieved single-cell derived spheres with and without CAF co-culture for single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Whole transcriptome analysis highlights that CAF co-culture can boost cancer stemness especially ALDH(high) CSCs and alter epithelial/mesenchymal status. Single-cell resolution allows identification of individual CSCs and investigation of cancer cellular heterogeneity. Incorporating whole transcriptome sequencing data with public patient database, we discovered novel genes associated with cancer-CAF interaction and critical to patient survival. The preliminary works demonstrated a reliable platform for enrichment of CSCs and studies of cancer-stromal interaction.

Objective: Utilizing a novel P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy-2-dimensional chemical shift imaging method, this study examined the heterogeneity and bioenergetic consequences of postinfarction left ventricular (LV) remodeling and the mechanisms of endogenous progenitor cell contribution to the cellular therapy. Methods and Results: Human embryonic stem cell-derived vascular cells (hESC-VCs) that stably express green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase (GFP(+)/Luc(+)) were used for the transplantation. hESC-VCs may release various cytokines to promote angiogenesis, prosurvival, and antiapoptotic effects. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that hESC-VCs effectively inhibit myocyte apoptosis. In the mouse model, a fibrin patch-based cell delivery resulted in a significantly better cell engraftment rate that was accompanied by a better ejection fraction. In the swine model of ischemia-reperfusion, the patch-enhanced delivery of hESC-VCs resulted in alleviation of abnormalities including border zone myocardial perfusion, contractile dysfunction, and LV wall stress. These results were also accompanied by a pronounced recruitment of endogenous c-kit(+) cells to the injury site. These improvements were directly associated with a remarkable improvement in myocardial energetics, as measured by a novel in vivo P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy-2-dimensional chemical shift imaging technology. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that a severely abnormal heterogeneity of myocardial bioenergetics in hearts with postinfarction LV remodeling can be alleviated by the hESC-VCs therapy. These findings suggest an important therapeutic target of peri-scar border zone and a promising therapeutic potential for using hESC-VCs together with the fibrin patch-based delivery system.

Chemoresistance results in tumor relapse, leading to poor prognosis in GC patients; thus, identifying key regulators in this process might provide novel clues for GC therapy. Herein, we identify hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) as a key regulator of chemoresistance in GC. HMMR was found to be substantially up-regulated in 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu)-resistant GC biopsies and cell lines. High expression of HMMR significantly correlates with tumor relapse and predicts poorer prognosis in GC patients. Moreover, we observed that HMMR induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased the cancer stem cell properties of GC, thus rendering resistance to chemotherapy. Importantly, silencing of HMMR effectively increased the susceptibility to 5-Fu therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HMMR activates the TGF-/Smad2 signaling pathway, which was required for the HMMR-mediated oncogenic effects and exhibited significant clinical relevance with HMMR expression. These findings reveal a critical role for HMMR in the chemoresistance of GC and suggest that HMMR might be a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target against the disease.Zhang, H., Ren, L., Ding, Y., Li, F., Chen, X., Ouyang, Y., Zhang, Y., Zhang, D.

Endothelial cells are essential for patterning vascular structures, but they require supportive mural cells such as pericytes/mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to generate stable, functional blood vessels. While there is evidence that the angiogenic effect of MSCs is mediated via the secretion of paracrine signals, the identity of these signals is unknown. By utilizing two functionally distinct human MSC clones, we found that so-called "pericytic" MSCs secrete the pro-angiogenic vascular guidance molecule SLIT3, which guides vascular development by directing ROBO4-positive endothelial cells to form networks in engineered tissue. In contrast, "non-pericytic" MSCs exhibit reduced activation of the SLIT3/ROBO4 pathway and do not support vascular networks. Using live cell imaging of organizing 3D vascular networks, we show that siRNA knockdown of SLIT3 in MSCs leads to disorganized clustering of ECs. Knockdown of its receptor ROBO4 in ECs abolishes the generation of functional human blood vessels in an in vivo xenogenic implant. These data suggest that the SLIT3/ROBO4 pathway is required for MSC-guided vascularization in engineered tissues. Heterogeneity of SLIT3 expression may underlie the variable clinical success of MSCs for tissue repair applications. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In oral cancer, several biomarkers including cell surface molecules have been exploited for the identification of this highly tumorigenic population. Implicit is the role of CD44 in defining CSCs but CD24 is not well-explored. Here we show that CD44(high)CD24(low) cells isolated from the oral cancer cell lines, not only express stem cell related genes but also exhibit Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. This CD44(high)CD24(low) population gives rise to all other cell types upon differentiation. Typical Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) phenotypes like increased colony formation, sphere forming ability, migration and invasion were also confirmed in CD44(high)CD24(low) cells. Drug transporters were found to be over-expressed in CD44(high)CD24(low)sub population thereby contributing to elevated chemo-resistance. To validate our findings in-vivo, we determined the relative expression of CD44 and CD24 in clinical samples of OSCC patients. CD44 expression was consistently high whereas CD24 showed significantly lower expression in tumour tissues. Further, the gene expression profile of the CSC and non-CSC population unravels the molecular pathways which may contribute to sternness. We conclude that CD44(high)CD24(low) represents cancer stem-like cells in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cancer-stromal cell fusion as revealed by fluorescence protein tracking	PROSTATE												Purpose We previously determined that cancer-stromal interaction was a direct route to tumor cell heterogeneity progression, since cancer-stromal cell fusion in coculture resulted in the creation of heterogeneous clones of fusion hybrid progeny. In this report, we modified the cancer-stromal coculture system to establish optimal experimental conditions for investigating cell fusion machinery and the mechanism of heterogeneity progression. Experimental design Red fluorescence protein-tagged LNCaP cells were cocultured with green fluorescence protein-labeled prostate stromal cells for cancer-stromal cell fusion, which was tracked as dual fluorescent cells by fluorescence microscopy. Results We identified the most efficient strategy to isolate clones of fusion hybrid progenies. From the coculture, mixed cells including fusion hybrids were subjected to low-density replating for colony formation by fusion hybrid progeny. These colonies could propagate into derivative cell populations. Compared to the parental LNCaP cells, clones of the fusion hybrid progeny displayed divergent behaviors and exhibited permanent genomic hybridization. Conclusions Cancer-stromal cell fusion leads to cancer cell heterogeneity. The cancer-stromal coculture system characterized in this study can be used as a model for molecular characterization of cancer cell fusion as the mechanism behind the progression of heterogeneity observed in clinical prostate cancers.

Direct evidence for lineage-dependent effects of bone marrow stromal cells on tumor progression	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH												We sought to characterize the function of bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) populations in tumor progression. Because this function may depend on the cell-lineage and mouse strain heterogeneity, we first characterized ex vivo the BMSCs harvested from C57BL/6 versus FVB mice and established their in vivo function in tumor growth and metastasis experiments. All plastic-adherent BMSCs expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) and stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1), consistent with a mesenchymal precursor phenotype, as well as CD80. Moreover, these BMSCs were capable of differentiation along mesenchymal lineage into adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes or myofibroblasts. However, further phenotypic analysis detected a distinct populations of myeloid (CD11b(+)) precursor cells amongst the ex vivo expanded BMSCs -with specific surface marker phenotypes and gene expression pattern. When co-implanted with metastatic cancer cells, all the BMSCs persisted and integrated into tumor stroma, but only myeloid BMSCs significantly promoted tumor growth and metastasis. These data demonstrate the differential effect of BMSCs sub-populations on tumor progression. These results may have important implications for anti-tumor therapy and for the use of mesenchymal BMSCs as cell-based therapies.

Whether these myofiber-associated non-myogenic cells develop from resident stem cells that possess mesenchymal plasticity or from other stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain unsolved. To address this question, we applied a method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from somatic mutations to MSCs and myogenic and non-myogenic cells from individual myofibers that were cultured at clonal density. Our analyses show that (i) in addition to myogenic progenitors, myofibers also harbor non-myogenic progenitors of a distinct, yet close, lineage; (ii) myofiber-associated non-myogenic and myogenic cells share the same muscle-bound primordial stem cells of a lineage distinct from bone marrow MSCs; (iii) these muscle-bound primordial stem-cells first part to individual muscles and then differentiate into myogenic and non-myogenic stem cells.

Cancer Stem Cells in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Switch between Two Distinct Phenotypes That Are Preferentially Migratory or Proliferative	CANCER RESEARCH												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important driver of tumor invasion and metastasis, which causes many cancer deaths. Cancer stem cells (CSC) that maintain and initiate tumors have also been implicated in invasion and metastasis, but whether EMT is an important contributor to CSC function is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether a population of CSCs that have undergone EMT (EMT CSCs) exists in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We also determined whether a separate population of CSCs that retain epithelial characteristics (non-EMT CSCs) is also present. Our studies revealed that self-renewing CSCs in SCC include two biologically-distinct phenotypes. One phenotype, termed CD44(high)ESA(high), was proliferative and retained epithelial characteristics (non-EMT CSCs), whereas the other phenotype, termed CD44(high)ESA(low), was migratory and had mesenchymal traits characteristic of EMT CSCs. We found that non-EMT and EMT CSCs could switch their epithelial or mesenchymal traits to reconstitute the cellular heterogeneity which was characteristic of CSCs. However, the ability of EMT CSCs to switch to non-EMT character was restricted to cells that were also ALDH1(+), implying that only ALDH1(+) EMT cells had the ability to seed a new epithelial tumor. Taken together, our findings highlight the identification of two distinct CSC phenotypes and suggest a need to define therapeutic targets that can eradicate both of these variants to achieve effective SCC treatment.

Developmental insights from early mammalian embryos and core signaling pathways that influence human pluripotent cell growth and differentiation	STEM CELL RESEARCH												Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have two potentially attractive applications: cell replacement-based therapies and drug discovery. Both require the efficient generation of large quantities of clinical-grade stem cells that are free from harmful genomic alterations. The currently employed colony-type culture methods often result in low cell yields, unavoidably heterogeneous cell populations, and substantial chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we shed light on the structural relationship between hPSC colonies/embryoid bodies and early-stage embryos in order to optimize current culture methods based on the insights from developmental biology. We further highlight core signaling pathways that underlie multiple epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), cellular heterogeneity, and chromosomal instability in hPSCs. We also analyze emerging methods such as non-colony type monolayer (NCM) and suspension culture, which provide alternative growth models for hPSC expansion and differentiation. Furthermore, based on the influence of cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways, we propose concepts, strategies, and solutions for production of clinical-grade hPSCs, stem cell precursors, and miniorganoids, which are pivotal steps needed for future clinical applications.

The phenotypic diversity of cancer cells caused by genetic or epigenetic alterations (intratumor heterogeneity) confers treatment failure and may foster tumor evolution through Darwinian selection. Recently, we found DDX3X as the protein that was preferentially expressed in murine melanoma with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes by proteome analysis. In this study, we transfected PC9, human lung cancer cells harboring EGFR exon19 deletion, with cDNA encoding DDX3X and found that DDX3X, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, induced CSC-like phenotypes and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) accompanied with loss of sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. DDX3X expression was associated with upregulation of Sox2 and increase of cancer cells exhibiting CSC-like phenotypes, such as anchorage-independent proliferation, strong expression of CD44, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The EMT with switching from E-cadherin to N-cadherin was also facilitated by DDX3X. Either ligand-independent or ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in lung cancer cells that strongly expressed DDX3X. Lack of EGFR signal addiction resulted in resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, we found a small nonadherent subpopulation that strongly expressed DDX3X accompanied by the same stem cell-like properties and the EMT in parental PC9 cells. The unique subpopulation lacked EGFR signaling and was highly resistant to EGFR-TKI. In conclusion, our data indicate that DDX3X may play a critical role for inducing phenotypic diversity, and that treatment targeting DDX3X may overcome primary resistance to EGFR-TKI resulting from intratumor heterogeneity.

In order to clarify hMSC origin and disclose possible cytogenetic heterogeneity in hMSC belonging to different patients, bone marrow (BM)-derived hMSC samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were expanded in culture, characterized by flow cytometry, and screened by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization for the presence of possible cytogenetic aberrations, related or not to the hematopoietic neoplastic clone. Our data showed that the presence of cytogenetic aberrations in successfully expanded HM-MSC stromal layers derives from the persistence of contaminating hemopoietic cells (HC), which is greatly supported by in vitro culture conditions that could mimic in vivo microenvironmental niche. Interestingly, the presence of binucleated HM-MSC maintaining a diploid numerical setting has been also detected, while aneuploidies were observed more frequently in mononucleated HM-MSC from patients with an altered karyotype than in patients with a normal karyotype and controls. In conclusion, here, we showed that in ALL and in CLL, the BM-MSC has a normal karyotype, thus supporting a distinct origin from hematopoietic cells (HC). The presence of in vitro hMSC aneuploidy is associated with lymphoid neoplasias carrying chromosome abnormalities, suggesting that hMSC should be characterized before clinical application. The adequacy of hMSC cytogenetic characterization here proposed could represent a "prerequisite" to standardize the hMSC analysis before their use in the autologous setting and cellular therapy.

The role of heterogeneous environment and docetaxel gradient in the emergence of polyploid, mesenchymal and resistant prostate cancer cells	CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS												The ability of a population of PC3 prostate epithelial cancer cells to become resistant to docetaxel therapy and progress to a mesenchymal state remains a fundamental problem. The progression towards resistance is difficult to directly study in heterogeneous ecological environments such as tumors. In this work, we use a micro-fabricated evolution accelerator environment to create a complex heterogeneous yet controllable in-vitro environment with a spatially-varying drug concentration. With such a structure we observe the rapid emergence of a surprisingly large number of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in regions of very high drug concentration, which does not occur in conventional cell culture of uniform concentration. This emergence of PGCCs in a high drug environment is due to migration of diploid epithelial cells from regions of low drug concentration, where they proliferate, to regions of high drug concentration, where they rapidly convert to PGCCs. Such a mechanism can only occur in spatially-varying rather than homogeneous environments. Further, PGCCs exhibit increased expression of the mesenchymal marker ZEB1 in the same high-drug regions where they are formed, suggesting the possible induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these cells. This is consistent with prior work suggesting the PGCC cells are mediators of resistance in response to chemotherapeutic stress. Taken together, this work shows the key role of spatial heterogeneity and the migration of proliferative diploid cells to form PGCCs as a survival strategy for the cancer population, with implications for new therapies.

Aim: To assess the use of a novel technique, autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension transplantation, for correction of localized facial volume loss due to inflammatory pathologies. Methods: It was a pilot study conducted in the Dermatology Outpatient Department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension was transplanted in a total of 10 patients, out of which 5 had predominantly dermal loss and the rest had predominantly lipoatrophy. The donor tissue from the gluteal region was digested into a single cell suspension using collagenase-1 and injected into the recipient area. The outcome was assessed subjectively by patients and investigators and objectively using ultrasonography. Cell count, viability testing and measurement of mesenchymal stem cells were also done. Results: On assessment of patients, the median improvement in the predominantly dermal atrophy group at 3 and 6 months was 70% (range: 10-90%) and 80% (range: 0-90%), respectively, and in the predominantly lipoatrophy group, 0% (range: 0-40) and 0% (range: 0-50), respectively. Mean thickness of dermis + subcutis at the baseline was 1.835 mm (range: 0.89-6.04 mm), which increased to 2.912 mm (range: 0.88-7.07 mm, P = 0.03) at 6 months. Limitations: Our pilot study has some limitations such as small sample size and heterogeneity of the recruited patients. Conclusions: Autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension transplantation appears to be safe and effective in localized facial dermal defects because of inflammatory pathologies, but not effective in deeper defects.																	0378-6323	0973-3922				JAN-FEB	2019	85	1					44	50	PMID 30058570	10.4103/ijdvl.IJDVL_760_17							WOS:000454911300008	30058570

Hence, the present study aimed to identify a CSC subpopulation from adenocarcinoma cells (A549) as a model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Initially, we sorted two subpopulations known as the triple-positive (EpCAM(+)/CD166(+)/CD44(+)) and triple-negative (EpCAM(-)/CD166(-)/CD44(-)) subpopulation using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Sorted cells were subsequently evaluated for proliferation and chemotherapy-resistance using a viability assay and were further characterized for their clonal heterogeneity, self-renewal characteristics, cellular migration, alkaline dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and the expression of stemness-related genes. According to our findings the triple-positive subpopulation revealed significantly higher (P<0.01) proliferation activity, exhibited better clonogenicity, was mostly comprised of holoclones and had markedly bigger (P<0.001) spheroid formation indicating a better self-renewal capacity. A relatively higher resistance to both 5-fluouracil and cisplatin with 80% expression of ALDH was observed in the triple-positive subpopulation, compared to only 67% detected in the triple-negative subpopulation indicated that high ALDH activity contributed to greater chemotherapy-resistance characteristics. Higher percentage of migrated cells was observed in the triple-positive subpopulation with 56% cellular migration being detected, compared to only 19% in the triple-negative subpopulation on day 2. This was similarly observed on day 3 in the triple-positive subpopulation with 36% higher cellular migration compared to the triple-negative subpopulation. Consistently, elevated levels of the stem cell genes such as REX1 and SSEA4 were also found in the triple-positive subpopulation indicating that the subpopulation displayed a strong characteristic of pluripotency. In conclusion, our study revealed that the triple-positive subpopulation demonstrated similar characteristics to CSCs compared to the triple-negative subpopulation. It also confirmed the feasibility of using the triple-positive (EpCAM(+)/CD166(+)/CD44(+)) marker as a novel candidate marker that may lead to the development of novel therapies targeting CSCs of NSCLC.

This study sought to identify an optimal source of MSCs for cardiovascular disease therapy. We demonstrated that Nestin was a suitable marker for cardiac MSCs (Nes(+)cMSCs), which were identified by their self-renewal ability, tri-lineage differentiation potential, and expression of MSC markers. Furthermore, compared with bone marrow-derived MSCs (Nes(+)bmMSCs) or saline-treatedmyocardial infarction (MI) controls, intramyocardial injection of Nes(+)cMSCs significantly improved cardiac function and decreased infarct size after acute MI (AMI) through paracrine actions, rather than transdifferentiation into cardiac cells in infarcted heart. We further revealed that Nes(+)cMSC treatment notably reduced pan-macrophage infiltration while inducingmacrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in ischemic myocardium. Interestingly, Periostin, which was highly expressed in Nes(+)cMSCs, could promote the polarization of M2-subtypemacrophages, and knockdown or neutralization of Periostin remarkably reduced the therapeutic effects of Nes(+)cMSCs by decreasing M2 macrophages at lesion sites. Thus, the present work systemically shows that Nes(+)cMSCs have greater efficacy than do Nes(+)bmMSCs for cardiac healing after AMI, and that this occurs at least partly through Periostin-mediated M2 macrophage polarization.

J	Tonekaboni, SAM; Dhawan, A; Kohandel, M				Tonekaboni, Seyed Ali Madani; Dhawan, Andrew; Kohandel, Mohammad			Mathematical modelling of plasticity and phenotype switching in cancer cell populations	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that cancer stem cells proliferate via a hierarchical model of unidirectional differentiation. However, growing experimental evidence has advanced this hypothesis by introducing a bidirectional hierarchy, in which non-CSCs may dedifferentiate into CSCs. Various models have been developed enabling the incorporation of this plasticity within cancer cell populations, focusing on behaviour in the limit of a large number of cells. However, stochastic effects predominate in the limit of small numbers of cells, which correlates with biologically relevant assays such as the mammosphere formation assay (MFA). Here, we consider two mathematical models incorporating cellular plasticity, namely a two-compartment model and a hierarchical model, and by parameterizing these models with experimental data, we show this behavioural difference in the limits of large and small numbers of cells. Additionally, we analyse the effects of varying cellular plasticity on the survival of the cancer cell population, and show that interestingly, increased plasticity, in certain cases, may be advantageous in reducing the survival probability. Thus, this analysis highlights the necessity of experimentally studying both small and large populations of cancer cells concurrently to obtain valid model predictions, potentially aiding the design of novel therapeutics.

However, generation of abundant functional endothelium from pluripotent stem cells has been difficult because ECs generated by many existing strategies have limited proliferative potential and display vascular instability. The latter difficulty is of particular importance because cells that lose their identity over time could be unsuitable for therapeutic use. Here, we describe a 3-week platform for directly converting human mid-gestation lineage-committed amniotic fluid-derived cells (ACs) into a stable and expandable population of vascular ECs (rAC-VECs) without using pluripotency factors. By transient expression of the ETS transcription factor ETV2 for 2 weeks and constitutive expression the ETS transcription factors FLI1 and ERG1, concomitant with TGF-beta inhibition for 3 weeks, epithelial and mesenchymal ACs are converted, with high efficiency, into functional rAC-VECs. These rAC-VECs maintain their vascular repertoire and morphology over numerous passages in vitro, and they form functional vessels when implanted in vivo. rAC-VECs can be detected in recipient mice months after implantation. Thus, rAC-VECs can be used to establish a cellular platform to uncover the molecular determinants of vascular development and heterogeneity and potentially represent ideal ECs for the treatment of regenerative disorders.																	1754-2189	1750-2799				DEC	2015	10	12					1975	1985		10.1038/nprot.2015.126							WOS:000366122600006	26540589

However, how the crosstalk between stem cell programming and cytokine signaling regulates PD-L1 expression during stem cell differentiation and cancer cell plasticity remains unclear. Herein, we reported that PD-L1 expression was regulated by SOX2 during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and lung cancer cell plasticity. PD-L1 was induced during ESC differentiation to fibroblasts and was downregulated during SOX2-mediated reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Furthermore, SOX2 activation affected cancer cell plasticity and inhibited PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells. We discovered that the H3K27ac signal at the PD-L1 locus was enhanced during ESC differentiation to fibroblasts as well as during cancer plasticity of SOX2-positive lung cancer cells to SOX2-negative counterparts. Romidepsin, an epigenetic modifier, induced PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells, whereas TGF-beta stimulation downregulated SOX2 but upregulated PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, in addition to PD-L1, the expressions of EGFR and its ligand HBEGF were downregulated by activation of endogenous SOX2 expression during lung cancer cell plasticity and iPSC reprogramming, and the activation of EGFR signaling by HBEGF upregulated PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells. Together, our results reveal the crosstalk between SOX2 programming and cytokine stimulation influences PD-L1 expression, and these findings may provide insights into PD-L1-mediated therapeutics.																	1066-5099	1549-4918				OCT	2021	39	10					1298	1309		10.1002/stem.3429		JUN 2021					WOS:000667348100001	34182610

In this study, we used antibodies directed against Sca-1 and CD34, two markers originally ascribed to pulmonary cells harboring regenerative potential, to isolate single putative stem cells from murine lung tissue. The mean detection rate of positive cells was 8 per 10(6) lung cells. We then isolated and globally amplified the mRNA of positive cells to analyze gene expression in single cells. The resulting amplicons were then used for molecular profiling by transcript specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and global gene expression analysis using microarrays. Single marker-positive cells displayed a striking heterogeneity for the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal transcripts on the single cell level. Nevertheless, they could be subdivided into two cell populations: Sca-1(+)/CD34(-) and Sca-1(+)/CD34(+) cells. In these subpopulations, transcripts of the epithelial marker Epcam (CD326) were exclusively detected in Sca-1(+)/CD34(-) cells (p = 0.03), whereas mRNA of the mesenchymal marker Pdgfr alpha (CD140a) was detected in both subpopulations and more frequently in Sca-1(+)/CD34(+) cells (p = 0.04). FACS analysis confirmed the existence of a Pdgfra positive subpopulation within Epcam(+)/Sca-1(+)/CD34(-) epithelial cells. Gene expression analysis by microarray hybridization identified transcripts differentially expressed between the two cell types as well as between epithelial reference cells and Sca-1(+)/CD34(+) single cells, and selected transcripts were validated by quantitative PCR. Our results suggest a more mesenchymal commitment of Sca-1(+)/CD34(+) cells and a more epithelial commitment of Sca-1(+)/CD34(-) cells. In summary, the study shows that single cell analysis enables the identification of novel molecular markers in yet poorly characterized populations of rare cells. Our results could further improve our understanding of Sca-1(+)/CD34(+,-) cells in the biology of the murine lung.

It is therefore paramount to identify the molecular mechanisms that underlay this heterogeneity. Individually derived bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) preparations, studied here, diverged markedly in various properties, despite of being all tripotent in their differentiation potential. Microarray analysis showed that MSC diversity is evident also in highly variable gene expression patterns. Differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in toll-like receptors (TLRs) and differentiation pathways. Marked differences were observed in LPS binding protein (LBP) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 expression. These differences correlated with MSC functionality. Therefore, the possible contribution of these molecules to MSC diversity was examined. In the TLR signaling pathway, LBP levels predicted the ability of specific MSCs to secrete interleukin (IL)-6 in response to LPS. A relatively higher expression of TGF beta 1 endowed MSCs with a capacity to respond to IL-1 beta by reduced osteogenic differentiation. This study thus demonstratesmajor diversity withinMSC isolates, which appears early on following derivation and persists following long-term culture. MSC heterogeneity results from highly variable transcriptome. Differential expression of LBP and TGF beta 1, along with other genes, in different MSC preparations, produces the variable responses to external stimuli.

In high-grade gliomas (HGG), distinct hierarchical cell populations arise from different glioma stem-like cell (GSC) subpopulations. Extracellular vesicles (EV) shed by cells may serve as conduits of genetic and signaling communications; however, little is known about how HGG heterogeneity may impact EV content and activity. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of EVs isolated from patient-derived GSC of either proneural or mesenchymal subtypes. EV signatures were heterogeneous, but reflected the molecular make-up of the GSC and consistently clustered into the two subtypes. EV-borne protein cargos transferred between proneural and mesenchymal GSC increased protumorigenic behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, analyses of HGG patient data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that proneural tumors with mesenchymal EV signatures or mesenchymal tumors with proneural EV signatures were both associated with worse outcomes, suggesting influences by the proportion of tumor cells of varying subtypes in tumors. Collectively, our findings illuminate the heterogeneity among tumor EVs and the complexity of HGG heterogeneity, which these EVs help to maintain. (C) 2016 AACR.

In present study, we evaluated heterogeneity on drug resistance and its underlying mechanism between metastatic and primary CRC. Immunohistochemical results from clinical tissue microarray (TMA) suggested that the expression concordance rates of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and drug resistance relative proteins between lymph-node metastatic and primary CRC foci were low. The apoptotic and proliferation indexes in metastasis CRC specimens were decreased compared with primary. In vitro experimental results indicated that the migration and invasion abilities were upregulated in metastatic cells SW620 compared with primary cells SW480, the cellular efflux ability and WNT/beta-catenin activity were also upregulated in SW620 cells. After 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) treatment, the reduction in the proportion of cell apoptosis, CD133 and TERT expression levels in SW620 were lower than that in SW480 cells. Bioinformatics analysis in whole-genome transcriptional profiling results between metastatic and primary CRC cells suggested that differentially expressed genes were mainly centered on well-characterized signaling pathways including WNT/beta-catenin, cell cycle and cell junction. Collectively, heterogeneity of drug resistant was present between metastatic and primary CRC specimens and cell lines, the abnormal activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway could be a potential molecular leading to drug resistant ability enhancing in metastatic CRC cells.																		1949-2553				SEP 27	2016	7	39					63937	63949		10.18632/oncotarget.11570							WOS:000387167800088	27613840

Spatial distribution and survival of human and goat mesenchymal stromal cells on hydroxyapatite and beta-tricalcium phosphate	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE												The combination of scaffolds and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a promising approach in bone tissue engineering (BTE). Knowledge on the survival, outgrowth and bone-forming capacity of MSCs in vivo is limited. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI), histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry were combined to study the fate of gene-marked goat and human MSCs (gMSCs, hMSCs) on scaffolds with different osteoinductive properties. Luciferase-GFP-labelled MSCs were seeded on hydroxyapatite (HA) or beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), cultured for 7 days in vitro in osteogenic medium, implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice and monitored with BLI for 6weeks. The constructs were retrieved and processed for histomorphometry and detection of luciferase-positive cells (LPCs). For gMSCs, BLI revealed doubling of signal after 1week, declining to 60% of input after 3weeks and remaining constant until week 6. hMSCs showed a constant decrease of BLI signal to 25% of input, indicating no further expansion. Bone formation of gMSCs was two-fold higher on TCP than HA. hMSCs and gMSCs control samples produced equal amounts of bone on TCP. Upon transduction, there was a four-fold reduction in bone formation compared with untransduced hMSCs, and no bone was formed on HA. LPCs were detected at day 14, but were much less frequent at day 42. Striking differences were observed in spatial distribution. MSCs in TCP were found to be aligned and interconnected on the surface but were scattered in an unstructured fashion in HA. In conclusion, the spatial distribution ofMSCs on the scaffold is critical for cell-scaffold-based BTE. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Y.; Islam, Farhadul			Plasticity of Cancer Stem Cell: Origin and Role in Disease Progression and Therapy Resistance	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												In embryonic development and throughout life, there are some cells can exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of cells to differentiate into multiple lineages. In normal development, plasticity is highly regulated whereas cancer cells re-activate this dynamic ability for their own progression. The re-activation of these mechanisms enables cancer cells to acquire a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype- a subpopulation of cells with increased ability to survive in a hostile environment and resist therapeutic insults. There are several contributors fuel CSC plasticity in different stages of disease progression such as a complex network of tumour stroma, epidermal microenvironment and different sub-compartments within tumour. These factors play a key role in the transformation of tumour cells from a stable condition to a progressive state. In addition, flexibility in the metabolic state of CSCs helps in disease progression. Moreover, epigenetic changes such as chromatin, DNA methylation could stimulate the phenotypic change of CSCs. Development of resistance to therapy due to highly plastic behaviour of CSCs is a major cause of treatment failure in cancers. However, recent studies explored that plasticity can also expose the weaknesses in CSCs, thereby could be utilized for future therapeutic development. Therefore, in this review, we discuss how cancer cells acquire the plasticity, especially the role of the normal developmental process, tumour microenvironment, and epigenetic changes in the development of plasticity. We further highlight the therapeutic resistance property of CSCs attributed by plasticity. Also, outline some potential therapeutic options against plasticity of CSCs. .

Peripheral blood constitutes an accessible source of MSCs. We successfully isolated peripheral blood MSC (pbMSCs) lines, with or without previous bone marrow mobilization. All pbMSCs lines obtained in both conditions presented classical MSC markers and properties, alkaline phosphatase activity and multipotent capacity to differentiate among adipogenic, osteogenic or chondrogenic lineages, and suppressed the proliferation of T cells. pbMSCs showed migratory capacity without cytokine stimulation while increasing their migration rate in the presence of inflammatory or embryo implantation stimuli. Interestingly, in contrast to MSCs derived from endometrial tissue, three pbMSCs lines also showed increased migration towards the IFN-tau implantation cytokine. Moreover, the secretome produced by an early implantation stage embryonic trophectoderm cell line showed a chemoattractant effect in pbMSCs. Our results suggest that circulating MSCs are present in the peripheral blood under healthy conditions. The fact that both the inflammation and implantation signals induced pbMSCs chemotaxis highlights MSC heterogeneity and suggests that their migratory capacity may differ according to their tissue of origin and would suggest the possible active recruitment of MSCs from bone marrow during pregnancy to repress the immune response to prevent the embryo rejection by the maternal organism.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the heterogeneity of 36 human glioblastoma samples on a morphological level by immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that this method is valid for heterogeneity detection. 115 Areas of Interest were labelled. By cluster analysis, we defined two subtypes ("classical" and "mesenchymal"). The results of epigenomic analyses corroborated the findings. Interestingly, patients with tumors that consisted of both subtypes ("subtype-heterogeneous") showed a shorter overall survival compared to patients with tumor that were dominated by one subtype ("subtype-dominant"). Furthermore, the analysis of 21 corresponding pairs of primary and recurrent glioblastoma demonstrated that, additionally to an intratumoral heterogeneity, there is also a chronological heterogeneity with dominance of the mesenchymal subtype in recurrent tumors. Our study confirms the prognostic impact of intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma and makes this hallmark assessable by routine diagnostics. Tumor heterogeneity is considered to be a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM). Only more recently, it has become apparent that GBM is not only heterogeneous between patients (intertumoral heterogeneity) but more importantly, also within individual patients (intratumoral heterogeneity). In this study, we focused on assessing intratumoral heterogeneity. For this purpose, the heterogeneity of 38 treatment-naive GBM was characterized by immunohistochemistry. Perceptible areas were rated for ALDH1A3, EGFR, GFAP, Iba1, Olig2, p53, and Mib1. By clustering methods, two distinct groups similar to subtypes described in literature were detected. The classical subtype featured a strong EGFR and Olig2 positivity, whereas the mesenchymal subtype displayed a strong ALDH1A3 expression and a high fraction of Iba1-positive microglia. 18 tumors exhibited both subtypes and were classified as "subtype-heterogeneous", whereas the areas of the other tumors were all assigned to the same cluster and named "subtype-dominant". Results of epigenomic analyses corroborated these findings. Strikingly, the subtype-heterogeneous tumors showed a clearly shorter overall survival compared to subtype-dominant tumors. Furthermore, 21 corresponding pairs of primary and recurrent GBM were compared, showing a dominance of the mesenchymal subtype in the recurrent tumors. Our study confirms the prognostic impact of intratumoral heterogeneity in GBM, and more importantly, makes this hallmark assessable by routine diagnostics.

Live-Cell, Temporal Gene Expression Analysis of Osteogenic Differentiation in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a widely investigated type of mesenchymal stem cells with great potential for musculoskeletal regeneration. However, the use of ASCs is complicated by their cellular heterogeneity, which exists at both the population and single-cell levels. This study demonstrates a live-cell assay to investigate gene expression in ASCs undergoing osteogenesis using fluorescently tagged DNA hybridization probes called molecular beacons. A molecular beacon was designed to target the mRNA sequence for alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), a gene characteristically expressed during early osteogenesis. The percentage of cells expressing this gene in a population was monitored daily to quantify the uniformity of the differentiation process. Differentiating ASC populations were repeatedly measured in a nondestructive fashion over a 10-day period to obtain temporal gene expression data. Results showed consistent expression patterns for the investigated osteogenic genes in response to induction medium. Peak signal level, indicating when the most cells expressed ALPL at once, was observed on days 3-5. The differentiation response of sample populations was generally uniform when assessed on a well-by-well basis over time. The expression of alkaline phosphatase is consistent with previous studies of osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that molecular beacons are a viable means of monitoring the spatiotemporal gene expression of live, differentiating ASCs.

Brain Tumor Cells in Circulation Are Enriched for Mesenchymal Gene Expression	CANCER DISCOVERY												Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer characterized by local invasion and angiogenic recruitment, yet metastatic dissemination is extremely rare. Here, we adapted a microfluidic device to deplete hematopoietic cells from blood specimens of patients with GBM, uncovering evidence of circulating brain tumor cells (CTC). Staining and scoring criteria for GBM CTCs were first established using orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and then applied clinically: CTCs were identified in at least one blood specimen from 13 of 33 patients (39%; 26 of 87 samples). Single GBM CTCs isolated from both patients and mouse PDX models demonstrated enrichment for mesenchymal over neural differentiation markers compared with primary GBMs. Within primary GBMs, RNA in situ hybridization identified a subpopulation of highly migratory mesenchymal tumor cells, and in a rare patient with disseminated GBM, systemic lesions were exclusively mesenchymal. Thus, a mesenchymal subset of GBM cells invades the vasculature and may proliferate outside the brain.

MSC populations derived from different tissues or donors have been shown to exhibit variable gene expression patterns. Further, it is widely acknowledged that MSC isolates are heterogeneous mixtures of cells at different developmental stages. However, the heterogeneity of expression of lineage regulators has not been linked to differentiation potential of different MSC populations towards mesenchymal lineages. Here, we analyzed variation of expression of differentiation markers across whole population and between single differentiating cells of multipotent stromal cell populations derived from adipose tissue (AdMSCs) and skin (FBs) of seven donors. The results of the analyses show that all cell populations exhibit similar differentiation potential towards adipocyte, osteoblast and chondrocyte lineages despite tissue type- and donor-specific variations of expression of differentiation-associated genes. Further, we detected variable expression of lineage regulators in individual differentiating cells. Together, our data indicate that single cells of stromal cell populations could use distinct molecular mechanisms to reach a common cell fate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To shed light on the causes of this heterogeneity, MSCs were collected from either human BM (n = 5) or adipose tissue (AT) (n = 5), and expanded using 2 different culture methods: one based on fetal calf serum, and one based on human platelet lysate. After initial expansion, MSCs were frozen, and the vials were transported to 3 different laboratories and grown for 1 passage using the same brand of culture plastic, medium, and supplements. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and assayed for their gene expression profile using the Affymetrix exon microarray platform. Based on gene expression profiles, the most discriminative feature was the anatomical harvesting site, followed by culture methodology. Remarkably, genes in the WNT pathway were expressed at higher levels in BM-derived MSCs than in AT-derived MSCs. Although differences were found between laboratories, cell culture location only slightly affects heterogeneity. Furthermore, individual donors contributed marginally to the observed differences in transcriptomes. Finally, BM-derived MSCs displayed the highest level of similarity, irrespective their culture conditions, when compared to AT-derived cells.				Torensma, Ruurd/C-2853-2009; Jansen, Bastiaan J.

However, clinical studies have not yet provided conclusive evidence of their efficacy largely because of lack of patients' stratification criteria. The heterogeneity of MSC preparations is also a major contributing factor, as manufacturing of therapeutic MSC is performed according to different protocols among different centers. Understanding the variability of the manufacturing protocol would allow a better comparison of the results obtained in the clinical setting among different centers. In order to acquire information on MSC manufacturing we sent a questionnaire to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers registered as producing MSC. Data from 17 centers were obtained and analyzed by means of a 2-phase questionnaire specifically focused on product manufacturing. Gathered information included MSC tissue sources, MSC donor matching, medium additives for ex vivo expansion, and data on MSC product specification for clinical release. The majority of centers manufactured MSC from bone marrow (88%), whilst only 2 centers produced MSC from umbilical cord blood or cord tissue. One of the major changes in the manufacturing process has been the replacement of fetal bovine serum with human platelet lysate as medium supplement. 59% of centers used only third-party MSC, whilst only 1 center manufactured exclusively autologous MSC. The large majority of these facilities (71%) administered MSC exclusively from frozen batches. Aside from variations in the culture method, we found large heterogeneity also regarding product specification, particularly in the markers used for phenotypical characterization and their threshold of expression, use of potency assays to test MSC functionality, and karyotyping. The initial data collected from this survey highlight the variability in MSC manufacturing as clinical products and the need for harmonization. Until more informative potency assays become available, a more homogeneous approach to cell production may at least reduce variability in clinical trials and improve interpretation of results.

Using transcriptomic data of human patient-derived brain tumor stem cell lines (BTSCs), classified based on GBM-intrinsic signatures, we identify the AP-1 transcription factor FOSL1 as a key regulator of the mesenchymal (MES) subtype. We provide a mechanistic basis to the role of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (NF1), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway, in GBM mesenchymal transformation through the modulation of FOSL1 expression. Depletion of FOSL1 in NF1-mutant human BTSCs and Kras-mutant mouse neural stem cells results in loss of the mesenchymal gene signature and reduction in stem cell properties and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Our data demonstrate that FOSL1 controls GBM plasticity and aggressiveness in response to NF1 alterations.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) can be identified by expression of cell surface markers or enzymatic activity, but these methods are limited by phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of CSCs. An alternative phenotypic methodology based on in-vitro sphere formation has been developed, but it is typically labor-intensive and low-throughput. In this work, we present a 1,024-microchamber microfluidic platform for single-cell derived sphere formation. Utilizing a hydrodynamic capturing scheme, more than 70% of the microchambers capture only one cell, allowing for monitoring of sphere formation from heterogeneous cancer cell populations for identification of CSCs. Single-cell derived spheres can be retrieved and dissociated for single-cell analysis using a custom 96-gene panel to probe heterogeneity within the clonal CSC spheres. This microfluidic platform provides reliable and high-throughput sphere formation for CSC identification and downstream clonal analysis.

Longitudinal tracking of subpopulation dynamics and molecular changes during LNCaP cell castration and identification of inhibitors that could target the PSA(-/lo) castration-resistant cells	ONCOTARGET												We have recently demonstrated that the undifferentiated PSA(-/lo) prostate cancer (PCa) cell population harbors self-renewing long-term tumor-propagating cells that are refractory to castration, thus representing a therapeutic target. Our goals here are, by using the same lineage-tracing reporter system, to track the dynamic changes of PSA(-/lo) and PSA(+) cells upon castration in vitro, investigate the molecular changes accompanying persistent castration, and develop large numbers of PSA-/lo PCa cells for drug screening. To these ends, we treated LNCaP cells infected with the PSAP-GFP reporter with three regimens of castration, i.e., CDSS, CDSS plus bicalutamide, and MDV3100 continuously for up to similar to 21 months. We observed that in the first similar to 7 months, castration led to time-dependent increases in PSA(-/lo) cells, loss of AR and PSA expression, increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, and many other molecular changes. Meanwhile, castrated LNCaP cells became resistant to high concentrations of MDV3100, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other agents. However, targeted and medium-throughput library screening identified several kinase (e.g., IGF-1R, AKT, PI3K/mTOR, Syk, GSK3) inhibitors as well as the BCL2 inhibitor that could effectively sensitize the LNCaP-CRPC cells to killing. Of interest, LNCaP cells castrated for >7 months showed evidence of cyclic changes in AR and the mTOR/AKT signaling pathways potentially involving epigenetic mechanisms. These observations indicate that castration elicits numerous molecular changes and leads to enrichment of PSA-/lo PCa cells. The ability to generate large numbers of PSA-/lo PCa cells should allow future high-throughput screening to identify novel therapeutics that specifically target this population.

TGF beta promotes breast cancer stem cell self-renewal through an ILEI/LIFR signaling axis	ONCOGENE												FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGF beta signaling pathway by 3'-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGF beta stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates with enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knockdown cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies.

J	Shao, FJ; Liu, C				Shao, Fangjie; Liu, Chong			Revisit the Candidacy of Brain Cell Types as the Cell(s) of Origin for Human High-Grade Glioma	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE												High-grade glioma, particularly, glioblastoma, is the most aggressive cancer of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults. Due to its heterogeneous nature, glioblastoma almost inevitably relapses after surgical resection and radio-/chemotherapy, and is thus highly lethal and associated with a dismal prognosis. Identifying the cell of origin has been considered an important aspect in understanding tumor heterogeneity, thereby holding great promise in designing novel therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma. Taking advantage of genetic lineage-tracing techniques, performed mainly on genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), multiple cell types in the CNS have been suggested as potential cells of origin for glioblastoma, among which adult neural stem cells (NSCs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are the major candidates. However, it remains highly debated whether these cell types are equally capable of transforming in patients, given that in the human brain, some cell types divide so slowly, therefore may never have a chance to transform. With the recent advances in studying adult NSCs and OPCs, particularly from the perspective of comparative biology, we now realize that notable differences exist among mammalian species. These differences have critical impacts on shaping our understanding of the cell of origin of glioma in humans. In this perspective, we update the current progress in this field and clarify some misconceptions with inputs from important findings about the biology of adult NSCs and OPCs. We propose to re-evaluate the cellular origin candidacy of these cells, with an emphasis on comparative studies between animal models and humans.																	1662-5099					FEB 21	2018	11								48	10.3389/fnmol.2018.00048							WOS:000425648000002	29515370

Ink4a/Arf(-/-) and HRAS(G12V) transform mouse mammary cells into triple-negative breast cancer containing tumorigenic CD49f(-) quiescent cells	ONCOGENE												Intratumoral heterogeneity within individual breast tumors is a well-known phenomenon that may contribute to drug resistance. This heterogeneity is dependent on several factors, such as types of oncogenic drivers and tumor precursor cells. The purpose of our study was to engineer a mouse mammary tumor model with intratumoral heterogeneity by using defined genetic perturbations. To achieve this, we used mice with knockout (-/-) of Ink4a/Arf, a tumor suppressor locus; these mice are known to be susceptible to non-mammary tumors such as fibrosarcoma. To induce mammary tumors, we retrovirally introduced an oncogene, HRAS(G12V), into Ink4a/Arf(-/-) mammary cells in vitro, and those cells were inoculated into syngeneic mice mammary fat pads. We observed 100% tumorigenesis. The tumors formed were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. Further, they had pathological features similar to those of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (for example, pushing borders, central necrosis). The tumors were found to be heterogeneous and included two subpopulations: CD49f(-) quiescent cells and CD49f(-) cells. Contrary to our expectation, CD49f(-) quiescent cells had high tumor-initiating potential and CD49f(-) cells had relatively low tumor-initiating potential. Gene expression analysis revealed that CD49f(-) quiescent cells overexpressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-driving genes, reminiscent of tumor-initiating cells and claudin-low breast cancer. Our animal model with intratumoral heterogeneity, derived from defined genetic perturbations, allows us to test novel molecular targeted drugs in a setting that mimics the intratumoral heterogeneity of human TNBC.

Mouse mammary stem cells express prognostic markers for triple-negative breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH												Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of tumours in which chemotherapy, the current mainstay of systemic treatment, is often initially beneficial but with a high risk of relapse and metastasis. There is currently no means of predicting which TNBC will relapse. We tested the hypothesis that the biological properties of normal stem cells are re-activated in tumour metastasis and that, therefore, the activation of normal mammary stem cell-associated gene sets in primary TNBC would be highly prognostic for relapse and metastasis. Methods: Mammary basal stem and myoepithelial cells were isolated by flow cytometry and tested in low-dose transplant assays. Gene expression microarrays were used to establish expression profiles of the stem and myoepithelial populations; these were compared to each other and to our previously established mammary epithelial gene expression profiles. Stem cell genes were classified by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the expression of a subset analysed in the stem cell population at single cell resolution. Activation of stem cell genes was interrogated across different breast cancer cohorts and within specific subtypes and tested for clinical prognostic power. Results: A set of 323 genes was identified that was expressed significantly more highly in the purified basal stem cells compared to all other cells of the mammary epithelium. A total of 109 out of 323 genes had been associated with stem cell features in at least one other study in addition to our own, providing further support for their involvement in the biology of this cell type. GO analysis demonstrated an enrichment of these genes for an association with cell migration, cytoskeletal regulation and tissue morphogenesis, consistent with a role in invasion and metastasis. Single cell resolution analysis showed that individual cells co-expressed both epithelial-and mesenchymal-associated genes/proteins. Most strikingly, we demonstrated that strong activity of this stem cell gene set in TNBCs identified those tumours most likely to rapidly progress to metastasis. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that the biological properties of normal stem cells are drivers of metastasis and that these properties can be used to stratify patients with a highly heterogeneous disease such as TNBC.

MSC products are heterogeneous and we therefore investigated whether acoustophoresis, an ultrasound-based separation technology, could be used for the label-free enrichment of functionally different MSC populations. Acoustophoresis uses an ultrasonic standing wave field in a microchannel that differentially affects the movement of cells depending on their acoustophysical properties, such as size, density, and compressibility. Human bone marrow (BM) MSCs were generated by standard adherent culture in xeno-free medium and separated by microchip acoustophoresis. MSCs with up to 20% higher proliferation and 1.7-fold increased clonogenic potential were enriched in the side outlet of the chip compared to the input sample. These cells were significantly smaller (average diameter 14.5 +/- 0.4 mu m) compared to the center outlet fraction (average diameter 17.1 +/- 0.6 mu m) and expressed higher levels of genes related to proliferation and stem cell properties (i.e.,Ki-67[1.9-fold],Nanog1[6.65-fold],Oct4[2.9-fold], andCXCL12[1.8-fold],n= 3) in the side outlet compared to input. Fractions of MSCs in G(0)/G(1)cell cycle phase were significantly enriched in the side fraction and an up to 2.8-fold increase of cells in S/G(2)/M phases were observed in center fractions compared to side fractions and 1.3-fold increased compared to the input sample. Acoustophoresis did not compromise MSC phenotype, proliferation, clonogenic capacity, and viability (generally 87-98%), nor did it affect differentiation or immunomodulatory capacities. These results demonstrate that label-free acoustic separation can enrich functionally different MSC subsets which can potentially be employed to produce better-defined stromal cell products from cultured MSCs. Hence, acoustophoresis is a potentially promising separation technology to provide improved cell products for research and possible future clinical use.

GSCs are essential to drive tumor progression, whereas the biological roles of DGCs are largely unknown. In this study, we focused on the roles of DGCs in the tumor microenvironment. To this end, we extracted DGC-specific signature genes from transcriptomic profiles of matched pairs of in vitro GSC and DGC models. By evaluating the DGC signature using single cell data, we confirmed the presence of cell subpopulations emulated by in vitro culture models within a primary tumor. The DGC signature was correlated with the mesenchymal subtype and a poor prognosis in large GBM cohorts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project. In silico signaling pathway analysis suggested a role of DGCs in macrophage infiltration. Consistent with in silico findings, in vitro DGC models promoted macrophage migration. In vivo, coimplantation of DGCs and GSCs reduced the survival of tumor xenograft-bearing mice and increased macrophage infiltration into tumor tissue compared with transplantation of GSCs alone. DGCs exhibited a significant increase in YAP/TAZ/TEAD activity compared with GSCs. CCN1, a transcriptional target of YAP/TAZ, was selected from the DGC signature as a candidate secreted protein involved in macrophage recruitment. In fact, CCN1 was secreted abundantly from DGCs, but not GSCs. DGCs promoted macrophage migration in vitro and macrophage infiltration into tumor tissue in vivo through secretion of CCN1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that DGCs contribute to GSC-dependent tumor progression by shaping a mesenchymal microenvironment via CCN1-mediated macrophage infiltration. This study provides new insight into the complex GBM microenvironment consisting of heterogeneous cells.

Experimental Design: We performed immunohistochemical analyses of 12 proteins [CD44, CD24, ALDH1, vimentin, osteonectin, EPCR, caveolin 1, connexin 43, cytokeratin 18 (CK18), MUC1, claudin 7, and GATA3] selected based on their differential expression in breast cancer cells with more differentiated and stem cell-like characteristics in 47 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) only, 135 cases of IDC with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 35 cases of DCIS with microinvasion, and 58 cases of pure DCIS. We also analyzed 73 IDCs with adjacent DCIS to determine the differences in the expression of markers by histology within individual tumors. CD44+/CD24- and CD24-/CD24+ cells were detected using double immunohistochemistry. Results: CD44 and EPCR expression was different among the four histologic groups and was lower in invasive compared with in situ tumors, especially in luminal A subtype. The expression of vimentin, osteonectin, connexin 43, ALDH1, CK18, GATA3, and MUC1 differed by tumor subtype in some histologic groups. ALDH1-positive cells were more frequent in basal-like and HER2+ than in luminal tumors. CD44+/CD24- cells were detected in 69% of all tumors with 100% of the basal-like and 52% of HER2+ tumors having some of these cells.

J	Gan, JD; Wang, YJ; Zhou, XD				Gan, Jiadi; Wang, Yingjin; Zhou, Xiaodong			Stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis	EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE												The efficacy of stem cell (SC) transplantation in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has remained to be fully elucidated. In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine the clinical outcomes. Electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, WanFang and the Cochrane Library were screened for relevant studies published until January 13, 2018. The references of retrieved papers, systematic reviews and trial registries were manually screened for additional papers. Two authors were involved in screening the titles in order to select eligible studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. Studies were pooled using a random-effects model as well as the Begg's funnel plot and subgroup analysis was performed using Stata 14.0 software. A total of 47 studies were retrieved for detailed evaluation, of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. No substantial publication bias was identified. The meta-analysis revealed that SC therapy increased C-peptide levels when compared with placebo treatment in randomized-controlled trials [RCT; standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-1.63] and self-controlled trials (SMD, 0.66; 95% CI, -0.22 to 1.54). An analysis demonstrated that SC therapy was more efficient at reducing the glycated hemoglobin level compared with the control group in RCTs (SMD, 0.56; 95% CI; 0.06-1.06; and SMD, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.92-2.34, respectively). The graphs demonstrated that SC transplantation resulted in a reduction of insulin requirement. Furthermore, subgroup analyses revealed that patient age, medical history and the SC injection dose may be sources of the heterogeneity observed. The greatest benefit of SC transplantation was seen in patients aged 18 years or a medical history of <3 months. In addition, the SC injection dose of 10(7) IU/kg/day was more effective than <10(7) IU/kg/day when the cellular composition included mesenchymal SCs and hematopoietic SCs. In conclusion, SC therapy represents an efficient option for patients with T1DM. This systematic review was registered at the International prospective register of systematic reviews (no. 42018093930).																	1792-0981	1792-1015				DEC	2018	16	6					4479	4492		10.3892/etm.2018.6769							WOS:000452151700022	30542397

Cancer aggressiveness relates to intratumoral heterogeneity, including rare tumor initiating cells that share many features with adult stem cells. Both normal and cancer stem cells are characterized by their plasticity between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, progressing through a series of reversible intermediates. While a core of regulators (Snail, Zeb1-2,...) is renowned to promote epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT), OvoL/Shavenbaby factors now emerge as a family of key epithelial stabilizers. Therefore, pro-EMT and OvoL/Shavenbaby transcription factors could provide a molecular rheostat to control stemness and epithelial-mesenchyme plasticity. We address this question in flies, in which the unique OvoL/Shavenbaby factor offers a powerfulin vivoparadigm for functional analyses. Our results show that Shavenbaby is critical for adult stem cell homeostasis, and directly interacts with the Hippo pathway to protect stem cells from death.

Single Cell Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells: Transcriptional Heterogeneity and Diversity from Breast Cancer Cell Lines	PLOS ONE												Background: To improve cancer therapy, it is critical to target metastasizing cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors and may play a key role in cancer dissemination. Uncovering CTC phenotypes offers a potential avenue to inform treatment. However, CTC transcriptional profiling is limited by leukocyte contamination; an approach to surmount this problem is single cell analysis. Here we demonstrate feasibility of performing high dimensional single CTC profiling, providing early insight into CTC heterogeneity and allowing comparisons to breast cancer cell lines widely used for drug discovery. Methodology/Principal Findings: We purified CTCs using the MagSweeper, an immunomagnetic enrichment device that isolates live tumor cells from unfractionated blood. CTCs that met stringent criteria for further analysis were obtained from 70% (14/20) of primary and 70% (21/30) of metastatic breast cancer patients; none were captured from patients with non-epithelial cancer (n = 20) or healthy subjects (n = 25). Microfluidic-based single cell transcriptional profiling of 87 cancer-associated and reference genes showed heterogeneity among individual CTCs, separating them into two major subgroups, based on 31 highly expressed genes. In contrast, single cells from seven breast cancer cell lines were tightly clustered together by sample ID and ER status. CTC profiles were distinct from those of cancer cell lines, questioning the suitability of such lines for drug discovery efforts for late stage cancer therapy. Conclusions/Significance: For the first time, we directly measured high dimensional gene expression in individual CTCs without the common practice of pooling such cells. Elevated transcript levels of genes associated with metastasis NPTN, S100A4, S100A9, and with epithelial mesenchymal transition: VIM, TGF beta 1, ZEB2, FOXC1, CXCR4, were striking compared to cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that profiling CTCs on a cell-by-cell basis is possible and may facilitate the application of 'liquid biopsies' to better model drug discovery.

Pericytes possess a multilineage differentiation potential and have been suggested to be one of the developmental sources for MSCs. In human liver, pericytes have not been defined. Here, we describe the identification, purification, and characterization of pericytes in human adult and fetal liver. Flow cytometry sorting revealed that human adult and fetal liver contains 0.56% +/- 0.81% and 0.45% +/- 0.39% of CD146(+)CD45(-)CD56(-)CD34(-) pericytes, respectively. Of these, 41% (adult) and 30% (fetal) were alkaline phosphatase-positive (ALP(+)). In situ, pericytes were localized around periportal blood vessels and were positive for NG2 and vimentin. Purified pericytes could be cultured extensively and had low population doubling times. Immunofluorescence of cultures demonstrated that cells were positive for pericyte and mesenchymal cell markers CD146, NG2, CD90, CD140b, and vimentin, and negative for endothelial, hematopoietic, stellate, muscle, or liver epithelial cell markers von Willebrand factor, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD144, CD326, CK19, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, CYP3A7, glial fibrillary acid protein, MYF5, and Pax7 by gene expression; myogenin and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression were variable. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of cultures confirmed surface expression of CD146, CD73, CD90, CD10, CD13, CD44, CD105, and ALP and absence of human leukocyte antigen-DR. In vitro differentiation assays demonstrated that cells possessed robust osteogenic and myogenic, but low adipogenic and low chondrogenic differentiation potentials. In functional in vitro assays, cells had typical mesenchymal strong migratory and invasive activity. In conclusion, human adult and fetal livers harbor pericytes that are similar to those found in other organs and are distinct from hepatic stellate cells.

Extracellular Vesicles Induce Mesenchymal Transition and Therapeutic Resistance in Glioblastomas through NF-kappa B/STAT3 Signaling	ADVANCED BIOSYSTEMS												Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor and despite optimal treatment, long-term survival remains uncommon. GBM can be roughly divided into three different molecular subtypes, each varying in aggressiveness and treatment resistance. Recent evidence shows plasticity between these subtypes in which the proneural (PN) glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) undergo transition into the more aggressive mesenchymal (MES) subtype, leading to therapeutic resistance. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures secreted by nearly every cell and are shown to play a key role in GBM progression by acting as multifunctional signaling complexes. Here, it is shown that EVs derived from MES cells educate PN cells to increase stemness, invasiveness, cell proliferation, migration potential, aggressiveness, and therapeutic resistance by inducing mesenchymal transition through nuclear factor-kappa B/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling. The findings could potentially help explore new treatment strategies for GBM and indicate that EVs may also play a role in mesenchymal transition of different tumor types.

However, there are no reports presenting a clonal analysis of the proliferative potential, differentiation potential and allosuppressive effects of human mesenchymal stromal cell subsets. In this study, we performed a clonal analysis of mesenchymal stromal cells generated from human CD271(+) bone marrow mononuclear cells (CD271-MSCs). After transfection with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein, the cells were single-cell sorted and cultured for 2-4 weeks. A population doubling analysis demonstrated that 25% of CD271-MSC clones are fast-proliferating clones compared to only 10% of PA-MSC clones. Evaluation of the allosuppressive potential demonstrated that 81.8% of CD271-MSC clones were highly allosuppressive compared to only 58% of PA-MSC clones. However, no consistent correlation was observed between allosuppression and proliferative potential. Prostaglandin E2 levels were positively correlated with the allosuppressive activity of individual clones, suggesting that this molecule may be a useful predictive biomarker for the allosuppressive potential of mesenchymal stromal cells. In contrast, inhibitory studies of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase indicated that none of the clones used this enzyme to mediate their allosuppressive effect. Differentiation studies revealed the presence of tripotent, bipotent and unipotent CD271-MSC and PA-MSC clones which suppressed the allogeneic reaction to differing extents in vitro. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate differences between CD271-MSCs and PA-MSCs and indicate that neither proliferation potential nor differentiation potential represents a consistent predictive parameter for the immunomodulatory effects of either type of mesenchymal stromal cells.

ONCOTARGET												Glioblastomas in adults are highly heterogeneous tumors that can develop throughout the brain. To date no predictive-location marker has been identified. We previously derived two glioblastoma cell lines from cortical and periventricular locations and demonstrated distinct transcriptomic profiles. Based on these preliminary results, the aim of this study was to correlate glioblastoma locations with the expression of ten selected genes (VEGFC, FLT4, MET, HGF, CHI3L1, PROM1, NOTCH1, DLL3, PDGFRA, BCAN). Fifty nine patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were retrospectively included. Tumors were classified into cortical and periventricular locations, which were subsequently segregated according to cerebral lobes involved: cortical fronto-parietal (C-FP), cortical temporal (C-T), periventricular fronto-parietal (PV-FP), periventricular temporal (PV-T), and periventricular occipital (PV-O). Gene expression levels were determined using RT-qPCR. Compared to cortical glioblastomas, periventricular glioblastomas were characterized by a higher expression of two mesenchymal genes, VEGFC (p = 0.001) and HGF (p = 0.001). Among cortical locations, gene expressions were homogeneous. In contrast, periventricular locations exhibited distinct expression profiles. PV-T tumors were associated with higher expression of two proneural and cancer stem cell genes, NOTCH1 (p = 0.028) and PROM1 (p = 0.033) while PV-FP tumors were characterized by high expression of a mesenchymal gene, CHI3L1 (p = 0.006). Protein expression of NOTCH1 was correlated with RNA expression levels. PV-O glioblastomas were associated with lower expression of VEGFC (p = 0.032) than other periventricular locations, whereas MET overexpression remained exceptional. These data suggest a differential gene expression profile according to initial glioblastoma location.

Live-Cell, Temporal Gene Expression Analysis of Osteogenic Differentiation in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a widely investigated type of mesenchymal stem cell with great potential for musculoskeletal regeneration. However, use of ASCs is complicated by their cellular heterogeneity, which exists at both the population and single-cell levels. This study demonstrates a live-cell assay to investigate gene expression in ASCs undergoing osteogenesis using fluorescently tagged DNA hybridization probes called molecular beacons. Three molecular beacons were designed to target mRNA sequences for alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin (ALPL, COL1A1, and BGLAP), genes characteristically expressed during osteogenesis. The percentage of cells expressing these genes in a population was monitored daily to quantify the uniformity of the differentiation process. Differentiating ASC populations were repeatedly measured in a nondestructive fashion over a 21-day period to obtain temporal gene expression data. Results showed consistent expression patterns for the investigated osteogenic genes in response to induction medium. Peak expression was observed at days 3-4 for ALPL, day 14 for COL1A1, and day 21 for BGLAP. Additionally, the differentiation response of sample populations became more uniform after 2 weeks in osteogenic induction medium, suggesting a syncing of ASCs occurs over time. These findings are consistent with previous studies of osteogenic differentiation and suggest that molecular beacons are a viable means to monitor the spatiotemporal gene expression of live, differentiating ASCs.

Moreover, these cells remain phenotypically distinct even after they have been serially passaged under identical culture conditions, thus ruling out local mesenchymal influence as the sole cause of their in vivo differences. During vitamin A deficiency, mouse urothelium form multiple keratinized foci in proximal urethra probably originating from scattered K14-positive basal cells, and the keratinized epithelium expands horizontally to replace the surrounding normal urothelium. These data suggest that the urothelium consists of multiple cell lineages, that trigone urothelium is closely related to the urothelium covering the rest of the bladder, and that lineage heterogeneity coupled with cell migration/ replacement form the cellular basis for urothelial squamous metaplasia.

However, previous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising therapeutic approach, whereas the exact underlying molecular mechanisms of MSCs in treating CD remain unclear. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of MSCs, as well as the in vivo microenvironments may influence the therapeutic efficacy. In our previous study, we found that a subpopulation of mouse MSCs with a high expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), one of the members of vitamin K-dependent protein family, possessed better immunoregulatory properties. Therefore, in this study we investigate whether the abundant MSCs-derived MGP participate in the therapeutic mechanisms for MSCs treating CD. Obvious suppression of cell proliferation and cytokine production in T cells were observed in vitro through MSCs-derived MGP. Moreover, MGP alleviated the clinical and histopathological severity of colonic inflammation in mouse experimental colitis models to a remarkable degree. Our results indicate that MGP might be a novel important mediator of MSCs- mediated immunomodulation in treating CD.

Lipomas, benign neoplasms in adipose tissue, have been reported as a potential source of stem cells. These lipoma-derived mesenchymal stem cells (LDSCs) may be useful for regenerative medicine. However, the detailed characteristics of LDSCs have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the cellular proteomics and secretomes of canine LDSCs in addition to morphology and proliferation and differentiation capacities. Some LDSCs isolated from canine subcutaneous lipomas were morphologically different from ADSCs and showed a rounded shape instead of fibroblast-like morphology. The phenotype of cell surface markers in LDSCs was similar to those in ADSCs, but CD29 and CD90 stem cell markers were more highly expressed compared with those of ADSCs. LDSCs had noticeably high proliferation ability, but no significant differences were observed compared with ADSCs. In regard to differentiation capacity compared to ADSCs, LDSCs showed higher adipogenesis, but no differences were observed with osteogenesis. Cellular proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that over 95% of protein spots showed similar expression levels between LDSCs and ADSCs. Secretome analysis was performed using iTRAQ and quantitative cytokine arrays. Over 1900 proteins were detected in conditioned medium (CM) of LDSCs and ADSCs, and 94.0% of detected proteins showed similar expression levels between CM of both cell types. Results from cytokine arrays including 20 cytokines showed no significant differences between CM of LDSCs and that of ADSCs. Our results indicate that canine LDSCs had variability in characteristics among individuals in contrast with those of ADSCs. Cellular proteomics and secretomes were similar in both LDSCs and ADSCs. These findings suggest that LDSCs may be suitable for application in regenerative medicine.

To clarify the feature of K19-proficient HCC, we traced epigenetic footprints in cultured cells and clinical materials. Patients and Methods: In vitro, KRT19 promoter methylation was analyzed and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine with trichostatin A (TSA) treatment was performed. Among 564 surgically resected HCCs, the clinicopathological relevance of K19-proficent HCCs was performed in comparison with hepatocytic (HepPar-1 and arginase-1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin and vimentin), biliary differentiation- associated (K7 and NOTCH-1) markers, and epigenetic markers (KRT19 promoter/long interspersed nucleotide element-1 [LINE-1] methylation status). Results: KRT19 promoter methylation was clearly associated with K19 deficiency and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine with TSA treatment-stimulated K19 re-expression, implicating DNA methylation as a potential epigenetic process for K19 expression. After excluding HCCs with recurrence, TNM stage as IIIB or greater, preoperative therapy, transplantation, and combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, we assessed 125 of 564 HCC cases. In this cohort, K19 expression was found in 29 HCCs (23.2%) and corresponded with poor survival following surgery (p = 0.025) and extrahepatic recurrence-free survival (p = 0.017). Compared with K19-deficient HCCs, lower KRT19 promoter methylation level was observed in K19-proficient HCCs (p < 0.0001). Conversely, HCC with genome-wide LINE-1 hypermethylation was frequently observed in K19-proficient HCCs (p = 0.0079). Additionally, K19 proficiency was associated with K7 proficiency (p = 0.043), and reduced E-cadherin and HepPar-1 expression (p = 0.043 and p < 0.0001, respectively).

Therefore, we investigated cellular composition of growing and non-growing mouse and human teeth. As a result, we report an unappreciated cellular complexity of the continuously-growing mouse incisor, which suggests a coherent model of cell dynamics enabling unarrested growth. This model relies on spatially-restricted stem, progenitor and differentiated populations in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments underlying the coordinated expansion of two major branches of pulpal cells and diverse epithelial subtypes. Further comparisons of human and mouse teeth yield both parallelisms and differences in tissue heterogeneity and highlight the specifics behind growing and non-growing modes. Despite being similar at a coarse level, mouse and human teeth reveal molecular differences and species-specific cell subtypes suggesting possible evolutionary divergence. Overall, here we provide an atlas of human and mouse teeth with a focus on growth and differentiation. Unlike human teeth, mouse incisors grow throughout life, based on stem and progenitor cell activity. Here the authors generate single cell RNA-seq comparative maps of continuously-growing mouse incisor, non-growing mouse molar and human teeth, combined with lineage tracing to reveal dental cell complexity.

A strict dependency between BCSCs and stromal cell components of tumor microenvironment exists. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies aimed to target the crosstalk between activated microenvironment and BCSCs have the potential to improve clinical outcome. Here, we investigated how leptin, as a mediator of tumor-stromal interactions, may affect BCSC activity using patient-derived samples (n = 16) and breast cancer cell lines, and determined the potential benefit of targeting leptin signaling in these model systems. Conditioned media (CM) from cancer-associated fibroblasts and breast adipocytes significantly increased mammosphere formation in breast cancer cells and depletion of leptin from CM completely abrogated this effect. Mammosphere cultures exhibited increased leptin receptor (OBR) expression and leptin exposure enhanced mammosphere formation. Microarray analyses revealed a similar expression profile of genes involved in stem cell biology among mammospheres treated with CM and leptin. Interestingly, leptin increased mammosphere formation in metastatic breast cancers and expression of OBR as well as HSP90, a target of leptin signaling, were directly correlated with mammosphere formation in metastatic samples (r = 0.68/p = 0.05; r = 0.71/p = 0.036, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that OBR and HSP90 expression were associated with reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients (HR = 1.9/p = 0.022;HR = 2.2/p = 0.00017, respectively). Furthermore, blocking leptin signaling by using a full leptin receptor antagonist significantly reduced mammosphere formation in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived samples. Our results suggest that leptin/leptin receptor signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target that can block the stromal-tumor interactions driving BCSC-mediated disease progression.

It is characterized by a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only around 10% and an ongoing increase in death rate. Due to the lack of early and specific symptoms, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced or even metastasized stage, essentially limiting curative treatment options. However, even curative resection of the primary tumor and adjuvant therapy often fails to provide a long-term survival benefit. One reason for this dismal situation can be seen in the evolution of therapy resistances. Furthermore, PDAC is characterized by high intratumor heterogeneity, pointing towards an abundance of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are regarded as essential for tumor initiation and drug resistance. Additionally, it was shown that the gut microbiome is altered in PDAC patients, promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT), determines responses towards chemotherapy, and affects survival in PDAC patients. Given the established links between CSCs and EMT as well as drug resistance, and the emerging role of the microbiome in PDAC, we postulate that the composition of the microbiome of PDAC patients is a critical determinant for the abundance and plasticity of CSC populations and thus tumor heterogeneity in PDAC. Unravelling this complex interplay might pave the way for novel treatment strategies.</p>																	2234-943X					SEP 23	2021	11								740606	10.3389/fonc.2021.740606							WOS:000705100400001	34631577

Here, we report that the LGALS1 gene, encoding the carbohydrate binding protein, galectin1, is a key regulator of BTSCs and glioblastoma resistance to therapy. Genetic deletion of LGALS1 alters BTSC gene expression profiles and results in downregulation of gene sets associated with the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we establish that inhibition of LGALS1 signaling in BTSCs impairs self-renewal, suppresses tumorigenesis, prolongs lifespan, and improves glioblastoma response to ionizing radiation in preclinical animal models. Mechanistically, we show that LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 with its expression robustly regulated by the ligand OSM. Importantly, we establish that galectin1 forms a complex with the transcription factor HOXA5 to reprogram the BTSC transcriptional landscape. Our data unravel an oncogenic signaling pathway by which the galectin1/HOXA5 complex maintains BTSCs and promotes glioblastoma.

Generation and Characterization of Multipotent Stem Cells from Established Dermal Cultures	PLOS ONE												Human multipotent skin derived precursor cells (SKPs) are traditionally sourced from dissociated dermal tissues; therefore, donor availability may become limiting. Here we demonstrate that both normal and diseased adult human dermal fibroblasts (DF) pre-cultured in conventional monolayers are capable of forming SKPs (termed m-SKPs). Moreover, we show that these m-SKPs can be passaged and that cryopreservation of original fibroblast monolayer cultures does not reduce m-SKP yield; however, extensive monolayer passaging does. Like SKPs generated from dissociated dermis, these m-SKPs expressed nestin, fibronectin and versican at the protein level. At the transcriptional level, m-SKPs derived from normal adult human DF, expressed neural crest stem cell markers such as p75NTR, embryonic stem cell markers such as Nanog and the mesenchymal stem cell marker Dermo-1. Furthermore, appropriate stimuli induced m-SKPs to differentiate down either mesenchymal or neural lineages resulting in lipid accumulation, calcification and S100 beta or beta-III tubulin expression (with multiple processes). m-SKP yield was greater from neonatal foreskin cultures compared to those from adult DF cultures; however, the former showed a greater decrease in m-SKP forming capacity after extensive monolayer passaging. m-SKP yield was greater from adult DF cultures expressing more alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA). In turn, elevated alpha SMA expression correlated with cells originating from specimens isolated from biopsies containing more terminal hair follicles; however, alpha SMA expression was lost upon m-SKP formation. Others have shown that dissociated human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) are a highly enriched source of SKPs. However, conversely and unexpectedly, monolayer cultured human hair follicle DP cells failed to form m-SKPs whereas those from the murine vibrissae follicles did. Collectively, these findings reveal the potential for using expanded DF cultures to produce SKPs, the heterogeneity of SKP forming potential of skin from distinct anatomical locations and ages, and question the progenitor status of human hair follicle DP cells.

We characterized stochastic phenotype switching as a mechanism contributing to intratumor heterogeneity and malignant potential of liver cancer. Clonal analysis of primary tumor cell cultures of a human sarcomatoid cholangiocarcinoma identified different types of self-propagating subclones characterized by stable (keratin-7-positive or keratin-7-negative) phenotypes and an unstable phenotype consisting of mixtures of keratin-7-positive and keratin-7-negative cells, which lack stem cell features but may reversibly switch their phenotypes. Transcriptome sequencing and immunohistochemical studies with the markers Zeb1 and CD146/MCAM demonstrated that switching between phenotypes is linked to changes in gene expression related but not identical to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Stochastic phenotype switching occurred during mitosis and did not correlate with changes in DNA methylation. Xenotransplantation assays with different cellular subclones demonstrated increased tumorigenicity of cells showing phenotype switching, resulting in tumors morphologically resembling the invasive component of primary tumor and metastasis. Conclusion. Our data demonstrate that stochastic phenotype switching contributes to intratumor heterogeneity and that cells with a switching phenotype have increased malignant potential.

While cultured cell lines have been derived from both normal and malignant tissues, it remains unclear to what extent they retain similar levels of differentiation and heterogeneity as that found within breast tissues. Methods: We used 12 reduction mammoplasty tissues, 15 primary breast cancer tissues, and 20 human breast epithelial cell lines (16 cancer lines, 4 normal lines) to perform flow cytometry for CD44, CD24, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and CD49f expression, as well as immunohistochemistry, and in vivo tumor xenograft formation studies to extensively analyze the molecular and cellular characteristics of breast epithelial cell lineages. Results: Human breast tissues contain four distinguishable epithelial differentiation states (two luminal phenotypes and two basal phenotypes) that differ on the basis of CD24, EpCAM and CD49f expression. Primary human breast cancer tissues also contain these four cellular states, but in altered proportions compared to normal tissues. In contrast, cultured cancer cell lines are enriched for rare basal and mesenchymal epithelial phenotypes, which are normally present in small numbers within human tissues. Similarly, cultured normal human mammary epithelial cell lines are enriched for rare basal and mesenchymal phenotypes that represent a minor fraction of cells within reduction mammoplasty tissues. Furthermore, although normal human mammary epithelial cell lines exhibit features of bi-potent progenitor cells they are unable to differentiate into mature luminal breast epithelial cells under standard culture conditions. Conclusions: As a group breast cancer cell lines represent the heterogeneity of human breast tumors, but individually they exhibit increased lineage-restricted profiles that fall short of truly representing the intratumoral heterogeneity of individual breast tumors. Additionally, normal human mammary epithelial cell lines fail to retain much of the cellular diversity found in human breast tissues and are enriched for differentiation states that are a minority in breast tissues, although they do exhibit features of bi-potent basal progenitor cells. These findings suggest that collections of cell lines representing multiple cell types can be used to model the cellular heterogeneity of tissues.

However, determination of cell shape phenotype in biomaterials is complicated by heterogeneous cell populations, microenvironment heterogeneity, and multi-parametric definitions of cell morphology. To associate cell morphology with cell-material interactions, we developed a shape phenotyping framework based on support vector machines. A feature selection procedure was implemented to select the most significant combination of cell shape metrics to build classifiers with both accuracy and stability to identify and predict microenvironment-driven morphological differences in heterogeneous cell populations. The analysis was conducted at a multi-cell level, where a "supercell" method used average shape measurements of small groups of single cells to account for heterogeneous populations and microenvironment. A subsampling validation algorithm revealed the range of supercell sizes and sample sizes needed for classifier stability and generalization capability. As an example, the responses of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) to fibrous vs flat microenvironments were compared on day 1. Our analysis showed that 57 cells (grouped into supercells of size 4) are the minimum needed for phenotyping. The analysis identified that a combination of minor axis length, solidity, and mean negative curvature were the strongest early shape-based indicator of hBMSCs response to fibrous microenvironment.

Despite extensive therapy the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor and the extraordinary therapy resistance has been attributed to intertumoral heterogeneity of glioblastoma. Different prognostic relevant GBM tumor subtypes have been identified based on their molecular profile. This approach, however, neglects the heterogeneity within individual tumors, that is, the intratumoral heterogeneity. Here, we detected the regional immunoreactivity by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using nine different markers on resected GBM specimens (IDH wildtype, WHO grade IV). We found repetitive expression profiles, that could be classified into clusters. These clusters could then be assigned to five pathophysiologically relevant groups that reflect the previously described subclasses of GBM, including mesenchymal, classical, and proneural subtype. Our data indicate the presence of tumor differentiations and tumor subclasses that occur within individual tumors, and might therefore contribute to develop adapted, individual-based therapies.

We demonstrated that ZEB2, the transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was upregulated in ascites cells from HGSOC patients and in CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB2 in EOC cells decreased the percentage of CSLCs and reduced the colony forming potential, cell invasion capacity and expression of pluripotent genes Oct4 and Nanog. Inhibition of ZEB2 also induced cellular apoptosis and impacted the tumorigenicity of ovarian CSLCs. The mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin were downregulated, while the epithelial marker E-cadherin was upregulated after ZEB2 knockdown. MiR-200a, a molecule that downregulates ZEB2, had the opposite effect of ZEB2 expression in EOC-CSLCs. A retrospective study of 98 HGSOC patients on the relationship of ascites volume, pelvic and abdominal metastasis, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and the malignant involvement of abdominal organs and lymph nodes was performed. Patients with high expression of ZEB2 in tumour tissues had a higher metastasis rate and a poorer prognosis than those with low expression. The parameters of ZEB2 expression and ascites volume were strongly linked with the prognostic outcome of HGSOC patients and had higher hazard ratios. These findings illustrated that ZEB2 facilitates the invasive metastasis of EOC-CSLCs and can predict peritoneal metastasis and a poor prognosis in HGSOC patients.																	0950-9232	1476-5594				AUG 12	2021	40	32					5131	5141		10.1038/s41388-021-01913-3		JUL 2021					WOS:000668832500002	34211089

Gelation was achieved via a mixed-mode step-and-chain-growth photopolymerization using functionalized 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol) as backbone macromer, eosin-Y as photosensitizer, and di-thiol containing molecule as dual purpose co-initiator/cross-linker. N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) was used to accelerate gelation kinetics and to adjust the stiffness of the hydrogels. Visible light (wavelength: 400-700 nm) was used to initiate rapid gelation (gel points: similar to 20 s) that reached completion within a few minutes. The major differences between current thiol-vinyl gelation and prior visible light mediated photopolymerization are that: (1) the co-initiator triethanolamine (TEA) used in the previous systems was replaced with multifunctional thiols and (2) mixed-mode polymerized gels contain less network heterogeneity. The gelation kinetics and gel properties at the same PEG macromer concentration could be tuned by changing the identity of vinyl groups and di-thiol cross-linkers, as well as concentration of cross,linker and NVP. Specifically, acrylate-modified PEG afforded the fastest gelation rate, followed by acrylamide and methacrylate-functionalized PEG. Increasing NVP concentration also accelerated gelation and led to a higher network cross-linking density. Further, increasing di-thiol peptide concentration in the gel formulation increased hydrogel swelling and decreased gel stiffness. Due to the formation of thiol-ether-ester bonds following thiol-acrylate reaction, the gels degraded hydrolytically following a pseudo first order degradation kinetics. Degradation rate was controlled by adjusting thiol or NVP content in the polymer precursor solution. The cytocompatibility and utility of this hydrogel system were evaluated using in situ encapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Encapsulated hMSCs remained alive (>90%) throughout the duration of the study and the cells were differentiated down osteogenic lineage with varying degrees by controlling the rate and mode of gel degradation.

We used an antibody-independent CTC enrichment platform, ApoStream (R), which does not rely on any antibody, including anti-EpCAM, to capture EMT- and CSC-CTCs in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and correlated them to pathological complete response (pCR). Methods Blood samples from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were prospectively collected before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T-0), after chemotherapy but before surgery (T-1), and after surgery (T-2) and processed using ApoStream. CTCs detected were stained with additional markers to define 3 CTC subsets with the following phenotypes: epithelial CTCs (CK +, EpCAM+ or E-cadherin+), EMT-CTCs (beta- catenin+ or vimentin+), and CSC-CTCs (CD44 + and CD24(low)). Results We enrolled 55 patients, 47 of which had data for analysis. EMT-CTCs were detected in 57%, 62%, and 72% and CSC-CTCs in 9%, 22%, and 19% at the T-0, T-1, and T-2 time points, respectively. Counts of epithelial (P = 0.225) and EMT (P = 0.522) phenotypes of CTCs at T-0 did not significantly predict pCR. Moreover, no correlation between CTC count change and pCR was demonstrated. Conclusions ApoStream was successful in detecting EMT-CTCs among patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, EMT-/CSC-CTC counts did not correlate with pCR. Due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of this patient population, further study in a larger cohort of molecularly homogeneous patients is warranted.

However, its tumor heterogeneity and molecular characteristics are largely unknown. In this study, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of 23 ICC and combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma tumor specimens from Asian patients using Affymetrix messenger RNA (mRNA) and NanoString microRNA microarrays to search for unique gene signatures linked to tumor subtypes and patient prognosis. We validated the signatures in an additional 68 ICC cases derived from Caucasian patients. We found that both mRNA and microRNA expression profiles could independently classify Asian ICC cases into two main subgroups, one of which shared gene expression signatures with previously identified hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with stem cell gene expression traits. ICC-specific gene signatures could predict survival in Asian HCC cases and independently in Caucasian ICC cases. Integrative analyses of the ICC-specific mRNA and microRNA expression profiles revealed that a common signaling pathway linking miR-200c signaling to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was preferentially activated in ICC with stem cell gene expression traits. Inactivation of miR-200c resulted in an induction of EMT, whereas activation of miR-200c led to a reduction of EMT including a reduced cell migration and invasion in ICC cells. We also found that miR-200c and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) expression were negatively correlated and their expression levels were predictive of survival in ICC samples. NCAM1, a known hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker, was experimentally demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-200c. Conclusion: Our results indicate that ICC and HCC share common stem-like molecular characteristics and poor prognosis. We suggest that the specific components of EMT may be exploited as critical biomarkers and clinically relevant therapeutic targets for an aggressive form of stem cell-like ICC.

NGH is, therefore, a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is confounded by genetic heterogeneity. Here we show that NGH in serous ovarian cancer (SOC) can be accurately measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) cells, the cells of origin of SOC. Surveying the transcriptomes of similar to 6,000 FTE cells, predominantly from non-ovarian cancer patients, identified 6 FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of similar to 1,700 tumors robustly correlated with survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic stratification of SOC.				majd, Hooman Soleymani/ABI-5841-2020; Hu, Zhiyuan/U-1990-2019	majd, Hooman Soleymani/0000-0003-3293-5321; Hu, Zhiyuan/0000-0002-1688-6032; Yau, Christopher/0000-0001-7615-8523; Mallett, Garry/0000-0001-5475-9061; Morotti, Matteo/0000-0002-1790-1185												1535-6108	1878-3686				FEB 10	2020	37	2					226	+		10.1016/j.ccell.2020.01.003							WOS:000513775300012	32049047

However, its effects on tumor cell sternness are poorly understood at molecular level. Here we describe two epithelial tumor cells A431 and A459, originating from human lung and skin tumors, in which epithelial growth factor (EGF) induces sequential up-regulation of mPGES-1 and iNOS enzymes, producing an inflammatory intracellular milieu. We demonstrated that concerted action of EGF, mPGES-1 and iNOS causes sharp changes in cell phenotype demonstrated by acquisition of stem-cell features and activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). When primed with EGF, epithelial tumor cells transfected with mPGES-1 or iNOS to ensure steady enzyme levels display major stem-like and EMT markers, such as reduction in E-cadherin with a concomitant rise in vimentin, ALDH-1, CD133 and ALDH activity. Tumorsphere studies with these cells show increased sphere number and size, enhanced migratory and clonogenic capacity and sharp changes in EMT markers, indicating activation of this process. The concerted action of the enzymes forms a well-orchestrated cascade where expression of iNOS depends on overexpression of mPGES-1. Indeed, we show that through its downstream effectors (PGE-2, PICA, PI3K/Akt), mPGES-1 recruits non-canonical transcription factors, thus facilitating iNOS production. In conclusion, we propose that the initial event leading to tumor stem-cell activation may be a leveraged intrinsic mechanism in which all players are either inherent constituents (EGF) or highly inducible proteins (mPGES-1, iNOS) of tumor cells. We suggest that incipient tumor aggressiveness may be moderated by reducing pivotal input of mPGES-1. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We highlight the hierarchical and functional heterogeneity of the adipocyte lineage within the bone marrow, and how potentially different contexts dictate their interactions with hematopoietic populations. Recent findings: Growing evidence associates the adipocyte lineage with important functions in hematopoietic regulation within the BM niche. Initially proposed to serve as negative regulators of the hematopoietic microenvironment, studies have also demonstrated that BMAds positively influence the survival and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These seemingly incongruous findings may at least be partially explained by stagespecificity across the adipocytic differentiation axis and by BMAds subtypes, suggesting that the heterogeneity of these populations allows for differential context-based interactions. One such distinction relies on the location of adipocytes. Constitutive bone marrow adipose tissue (cBMAT) historically associates to the "yellow" marrow containing so-called "stable" BMAs larger in size, less responsive to stimuli, and linked to HSC quiescence. On the other hand, regulated bone marrow adipose tissue (rBMAT)-asso-ciated adipocytes, also referred to as "labile" are smaller, more responsive to hematopoietic demand and strategically situated in hematopoietically active regions of the skeleton. Here we propose a model where the effect of distinct BM stromal cell populations (BMSC) in hematopoiesis is structured along the BMSC-BMAd differentiation axis, and where the effects on HSC maintenance versus hematopoietic proliferation are segregated. In doing so, it is possible to explain how recently identified, adipocyte-primed leptin receptor-expressing, CXCL12-high adventitial reticular cells (AdipoCARs) and marrow adipose lineage precursor cells (MALPs) best support active hematopoietic cell proliferation, while adipose progenitor cells (APCs) and maturing BMAd gradually lose the capacity to support active hematopoiesis, favoring HSC quiescence. Implicated soluble mediators include MCP-1, PAI-1, NRP1, possibly DPP4 and limiting availability of CXCL12 and SCF. How remodeling occurs within the BMSC-BMAd differentiation axis is yet to be elucidated and will likely unravel a three-way regulation of the hematopoietic, bone, and adipocytic compartments orchestrated by vascular elements. The interaction of malignant hematopoietic cells with BMAds is precisely contributing to unravel specific mechanisms of remodeling. Summary: BMAds are important operative components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Their heterogeneity directs their ability to exert a range of regulatory capacities in a manner dependent on their hierarchical, spatial, and biological context. This complexity highlights the importance of (i) developing experimental tools and nomenclature adapted to address stage -specificity and heterogeneity across the BMSC-BMAd differentia-tion axis when reporting effects in hematopoiesis, (ii) interpreting gene reporter studies within this framework, and (iii) quantifying changes in all three compartments (hematopoiesis, adiposity and bone) when addressing interdependency.

Emerging evidences suggest that miR-200c functions as an effective CSCs inhibitor and can restore sensitivity to microtubule-targeting drugs. In the present work, the intelligent gelatinases-stimuli nanoparticles (NPs) was set up to co-deliver miR-200c and docetaxel (DOC) to verify their synergetic effects on inhibition of CSCs and non-CSC cancer cells. After tumor cells were treated with miR-200c NPs, miR-200c and its targeted gene class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3)TUBB3 expression were evaluated. The effects of miR-200c/DOC NPs on tumor cell viability, migration and invasion as well as the expression of E-cadherin and CD44 were studied. The antitumor effects of miR-200c/DOC NPs were compared with DOC NPs in xenograft gastric cancer mice. Moreover, the residual tumors after treatment were subcutaneously seeded into nude mice to further investigate the effective maintenance of NPs. We found that the gelatinases-stimuli NPs facilitated miR-200c into cells, achieving sustained miR-200c expression in tumor cells during 9 days. The miR-200c/DOC NPs significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of DOC, possibly by decreasing TUBB3 level, and reversing EMT. The miR-200c NPs achieved high levels of in vivo accumulation and long retention in gastric cancer xenografts after intravenous administration. The miR-200c/DOC NPs prominently suppressed in vivo tumor growth with elevated miR-200c and E-cadherin levels and down-regulated TUBB3 and CD44 expressions. When the residual tumors after miR-200c/DOC NPs treatment were re-transplanted into nude mice, the tumors demonstrated the slowest growth speed. The miR-200c/DOC NPs may provide a promising modality for co-delivery of nucleic acid and drugs to simultaneously inhibit CSCs and non-CSC cancer cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the principal cells commonly found in the tumor stromal niche, with capability of macrophage phenotypic switching. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) produced by marrow-derived MSCs in the phenotypic and functional pattern of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Methods First, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used for the CXCL12 gene knock-out in MSCs. Then, coculture systems were used to investigate the role of MSCsCXCL12-/- and MSCsCXCL12+/+ in determination of macrophage phenotype. To further analyze the role of the MSC-derived CXCL12 niche, cocultures of 4T1 mammary tumor cells and macrophages primed with MSCsCXCL12-/- or MSCsCXCL12+/+ as well as in-vivo limiting dilution assays were performed. Results Our results revealed that the expression of IL-4, IL-10, TGF-beta and CD206 as M2 markers was significantly increased in macrophages co-cultured with MSCsCXCL12+/+ , whereas the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha and iNOS was conversely decreased. The number and size of multicellular tumor spheroids were remarkably higher when 4T1 cells were cocultured with MSCCXCL12+/+-induced M2 macrophages. We also found that the occurrence of tumors was significantly higher in coinjection of 4T1 cells with MSCCXCL12+/+-primed macrophages. Tumor initiating cells were significantly decreased after coinjection of 4T1 cells with macrophages pretreated with MSCsCXCL12-/-. Conclusions In conclusion, our findings shed new light on the role of MSC-derived CXCL12 in macrophage phenotypic switching to M2, affecting their function in tumorigenesis.																	1425-8153	1689-1392				DEC	2021	26	1							30	10.1186/s11658-021-00273-w							WOS:000666862300001	34174813

However, the safety concerns regarding the use of MSCs remain unsolved, and conflicting effects are observed due to the heterogeneity of MSCs. Recently, exosomes were shown to mediate the paracrine effects of MSCs, making it a potential candidate for cell-free therapies. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of MSCs-derived exosomes (MSCs-exo) in an established cGVHD mouse model.MethodsBone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs were cultured, and the supernatants of these cultures were collected to prepare exosomes using ultracentrifugation. Exosomes from human dermal fibroblasts (Fib-exo) were used as a negative control. The cGVHD model was established, and tail vein injections of MSCs-exo or Fib-exo were administered once per week for 6weeks. The symptoms and signs of cGVHD were monitored, and histopathological changes were detected by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining. The effects of MSCs-exo on Th17, Th1, and Treg were evaluated by flow cytometry, qPCR, and Luminex. In addition, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated and treated with MSCs-exo in vitro. IL-17-expressing Th17 and IL-10-expressing Treg were evaluated by flow cytometry, qPCR, and ELISA.ResultsWe found that MSCs-exo effectively prolonged the survival of cGVHD mice and diminished the clinical and pathological scores of cGVHD. Fibrosis in the skin, lung, and liver was significantly ameliorated by MSCs-exo application. In MSCs-exo treated mice, activation of CD4+ T cells and their infiltration into the lung were reduced. Of note, MSCs-exo exhibited potent immunomodulatory effects via the inhibition of IL-17-expressing pathogenic T cells and induction of IL-10-expressing regulatory cells during cGVHD. The expressions of Th17 cell-relevant transcription factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines was markedly reduced after MSCs-exo treatment. In vitro, MSCs-exo blocked Th17 differentiation and improved the Treg phenotype in PBMCs obtained from healthy donors and patients with active cGVHD, further indicating the regulatory effect of MSCs-exo on GVHD effector T cells.ConclusionsOur data suggested that MSCs-exo could improve the survival and ameliorate the pathologic damage of cGVHD by suppressing Th17 cells and inducing Treg. This finding provides a novel alternative approach for the treatment of cGVHD.																	1756-8722					DEC 7	2018	11								135	10.1186/s13045-018-0680-7							WOS:000452707300001	30526632

Here, a microvasculature-on-a-chip system as a PVN model is used to evaluate the ex vivo dynamics of BTSCs from ten glioblastoma patients. BTSCs are found to preferentially localize in the perivascular zone, where they exhibit either the lowest motility, as in quiescent cells, or the highest motility, as in the invasive phenotype, with migration over long distance. These results indicate that PVN is a niche for BTSCs, while the microvascular tracks may serve as a path for tumor cell migration. The degree of colocalization between tumor cells and microvessels varies significantly across patients. To validate these results, single-cell transcriptome sequencing (10 patients and 21 750 single cells in total) is performed to identify tumor cell subtypes. The colocalization coefficient is found to positively correlate with proneural (stem-like) or mesenchymal (invasive) but not classical (proliferative) tumor cells. Furthermore, a gene signature profile including PDGFRA correlates strongly with the "homing" of tumor cells to the PVN. These findings demonstrate that the model can recapitulate in vivo tumor cell dynamics and heterogeneity, representing a new route to study patient-specific tumor cell functions.

William			The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition drivers ZEB1 and ZEB2 in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer	MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY												Docetaxel is the main treatment for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer; however, resistance eventually occurs. The development of intratumoral drug-resistant subpopulations possessing a cancer stem cell (CSC) morphology is an emerging mechanism of docetaxel resistance, a process driven by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study characterised EMT in docetaxel-resistant sublines through increased invasion, MMP-1 production and ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression. We also present evidence for differential EMT across PC-3 and DU145 in vitro resistance models as characterised by differential migration, cell colony scattering and susceptibility to the CSC inhibitor salinomycin. siRNA manipulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 in PC-3 and DU145 docetaxel-resistant sublines identified ZEB1, through its transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, to be a driver of both EMT and docetaxel resistance. The clinical relevance of ZEB1 was also determined through immunohistochemical tissue microarray assessment, revealing significantly increased ZEB1 expression in prostate tumours following docetaxel treatment. This study presents evidence for a role of ZEB1, through its transcriptional repression of E-cadherin to be a driver of both EMT and docetaxel resistance in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, this study highlights the heterogeneity of prostate cancer and in turn emphasises the complexity of the clinical management of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.					fabre, aurelie/0000-0001-8176-1386; Murphy, Keefe/0000-0002-7709-3159; Prencipe, Maria/0000-0002-8864-1560; Watson, William/0000-0001-8831-3244												1574-7891	1878-0261				MAR	2017	11	3					251	265		10.1002/1878-0261.12030							WOS:000405731900001	28133913					
J	Kalamohan, K; Gunasekaran, P; Ibrahim, S				Kalamohan, Kalaivani; Gunasekaran, Paramasamy; Ibrahim, Syed			Gene coexpression network analysis of multiple cancers discovers the varying stem cell features between gastric and breast cancer	META GENE												Several decades of research efforts gave a very good platform of genomic data repository for the researchers to study the gene expression and interactions of cancer samples. The analysis of genomic data in large scale provides a global view on dysregulation of molecular mechanisms in cancer. The conserved cancer hallmarks in prior studies motivated the researchers to identify the common molecular changes across cancers. In this study the mRNA profile data of gastric, colon, liver and breast were studied. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of four cancers has identified coexpressed and conserved modules in all four cancers. The conserved module depicts the major cellular mechanisms like immune response, extracellular matrix, mesenchymal stem cell, dream complex, cell cycle and embryonic stem cell. Intensive screening of the genes related to mesenchymal and embryonic stem cell has made a striking finding that the presence of stem cell properties in gastric and breast cancers is varying during the cancer progression. The change in expression of stem cell associated genes from grade II to grade III cancer samples are showing inverse relationship between gastric and breast cancers. Mesenchymal stem cell related genes are enriched in grade III gastric tumour samples, and in breast cancer it is enriched in grade II. On the other hand the embryonic stem cell related genes are enriched in grade II sample types of gastric tumour and in case of breast cancer it is enriched in grade III. The result of this study is integrative of two important cancer factors, the grade and stem cell properties. This finding unveils, the occurrence of stem cell properties in cancer, differ in grades. Hence, for remarkable results studies in cancer stem cell might be diverted and concentrated from single stem cell to mesenchymal and embryonic cells. This study hypothesize that varying stem cell properties during cancer progression might be a better concordance among the shared tumour cell properties defined as hallmark of cancer.

ASCL1 represses a SOX9(+) neural crest stem-like state in small cell lung cancer	GENES & DEVELOPMENT												ASCL1 is a neuroendocrine lineage-specific oncogenic driver of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), highly expressed in a significant fraction of tumors. However, similar to 25% of human SCLC are ASCL1-low and associated with low neuroendocrine fate and high MYC expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), we show that alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc in the mouse lung induce an ASCL1+ state of SCLC in multiple cells of origin. Genetic depletion of ASCL1 in MYC-driven SCLC dramatically inhibits tumor initiation and progression to the NEUROD1+ subtype of SCLC. Surprisingly, ASCL1 loss promotes a SOX9+ mesenchymal/neural crest stem-like state and the emergence of osteosarcoma and chondroid tumors, whose propensity is impacted by cell of origin. ASCL1 is critical for expression of key lineage-related transcription factors NKX2-1, FOXA2, and INSM1 and represses genes involved in the Hippo/Wnt/Notch developmental pathways in vivo. Importantly, ASCL1 represses a SOX9/RUNX1/RUNX2 program in vivo and SOX9 expression in human SCLC cells, suggesting a conserved function for ASCL1. Together, in a MYC-driven SCLC model, ASCL1 promotes neuroendocrine fate and represses the emergence of a SOX9+ nonendodermal stem-like fate that resembles neural crest.

GBM is highly refractory to therapy, and such unresponsiveness is due, primarily, but not exclusively, to the glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). This subpopulation express stem-like cell markers and is responsible for the heterogeneity of GBM, generating multiple differentiated cell phenotypes. However, how GBMs maintain the balance between stem and non-stem populations is still poorly understood. We investigated the GBM ability to interconvert between stem and non-stem states through the evaluation of the expression of specific stem cell markers as well as cell communication proteins. We evaluated the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of GSCs derived from differentiated GBM cell lines by comparing their stem-like cell properties and expression of connexins. We showed that non-GSCs as well as GSCs can undergo successive cycles of gain and loss of stem properties, demonstrating a bidirectional cellular plasticity model that is accompanied by changes on connexins expression. Our findings indicate that the interconversion between non-GSCs and GSCs can be modulated by extracellular factors culminating on differential expression of stem-like cell markers and cell-cell communication proteins. Ultimately, we observed that stem markers are mostly expressed on GBMs rather than on low-grade astrocytomas, suggesting that the presence of GSCs is a feature of high-grade gliomas. Together, our data demonstrate the utmost importance of the understanding of stem cell plasticity properties in a way to a step closer to new strategic approaches to potentially eliminate GSCs and, hopefully, prevent tumor recurrence.

Parametric analysis of colony morphology of non-labelled live human pluripotent stem cells for cell quality control	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Given the difficulties inherent in maintaining human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a healthy state, hPSCs should be routinely characterized using several established standard criteria during expansion for research or therapeutic purposes. hPSC colony morphology is typically considered an important criterion, but it is not evaluated quantitatively. Thus, we designed an unbiased method to evaluate hPSC colony morphology. This method involves a combination of automated non-labelled live-cell imaging and the implementation of morphological colony analysis algorithms with multiple parameters. To validate the utility of the quantitative evaluation method, a parent cell line exhibiting typical embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like morphology and an aberrant hPSC subclone demonstrating unusual colony morphology were used as models. According to statistical colony classification based on morphological parameters, colonies containing readily discernible areas of differentiation constituted a major classification cluster and were distinguishable from typical ESC-like colonies; similar results were obtained via classification based on global gene expression profiles. Thus, the morphological features of hPSC colonies are closely associated with cellular characteristics. Our quantitative evaluation method provides a biological definition of 'hPSC colony morphology', permits the non-invasive monitoring of hPSC conditions and is particularly useful for detecting variations in hPSC heterogeneity.

Despite considerable research on MSCs and their clinical application, the biology of these cells is not fully clarified and data on signalling activation during mesenchymal differentiation and proliferation are controversial. The role of Wnt pathways is still debated, partly due to culture heterogeneity and methodological inconsistencies. Recently, we described a new bone marrow cell population isolated from MSC cultures that we named Mesodermal Progenitor Cells (MPCs) for their mesenchymal and endothelial differentiation potential. An optimized culture method allowed the isolation from human adult bone marrow of a highly pure population of MPCs (more than 97%), that showed the distinctive SSEA-4(+)CD105(+)CD90(neg) phenotype and not expressing MSCA-1 antigen. Under these selective culture conditions the percentage of MSCs (SSEA-4(neg)CD105(+)CD90(bright) and MSCA-1(+)), in the primary cultures, resulted lower than 2%. Methodology/Principal Finding: We demonstrate that MPCs differentiate to MSCs through an SSEA-4(+)CD105(+)CD90(bright) early intermediate precursor. Differentiation paralleled the activation of Wnt5/Calmodulin signalling by autocrine/paracrine intense secretion of Wnt5a and Wnt5b (p<0.05 vs uncondictioned media), which was later silenced in late MSCs (SSEA-4(neg)). We found the inhibition of this pathway by calmidazolium chloride specifically blocked mesenchymal induction (ID50 = 0.5 mu M, p<0.01), while endothelial differentiation was unaffected. Conclusion:The present study describes two different putative progenitors (early and kite MSCs) that, together with already described MPCs, could be co-isolated and expanded in different percentages depending on the culture conditions. These results suggest that some modifications to the widely accepted MSC nomenclature are required.

Transcriptional heterogeneity of stemness phenotypes in the ovarian epithelium	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												Using spheroids as a model, the authors report the molecular signatures of ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells exhibiting stemness phenotype under various conditions in vitro, and found that there is a large degree of heterogeneity in the transcriptional profiles of stem cells induced under different conditions. They suggest that maintenance of the OSE may not require a single stem cell population, but heterogeneous stem cells that can be induced transiently under diverse environmental cues. The ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) is a monolayer of epithelial cells surrounding the ovary that ruptures during each ovulation to allow release of the oocyte. This wound is quickly repaired, but mechanisms promoting repair are poorly understood. The contribution of tissue-resident stem cells in the homeostasis of several epithelial tissues is widely accepted, but their involvement in OSE is unclear. We show that traits associated with stem cells can be increased following exposure to the cytokine TGFB1, overexpression of the transcription factor Snai1, or deletion of Brca1. We find that stemness is often linked to mesenchymal-associated gene expression and higher activation of ERK signalling, but is not consistently dependent on their activation. Expression profiles of these populations are extremely context specific, suggesting that stemness may not be associated with a single, distinct population, but rather is a heterogeneous cell state that may emerge from diverse environmental cues. These findings support that the OSE may not require distinct stem cells for long-term maintenance, and may instead achieve this through transient dedifferentiation into a stem-like state.

Inoculation of small cell numbers derived from these non-adherent cultures leads to rapid xenograft tumor formation in mice. Accordingly, injection of more differentiated monolayer cells derived from spheres results in significantly decelerated tumor growth. For our study, two breast cancer cell lines were generated from primary tumors and cultured as mammospheres or as their adherent counterparts. We examined the in vivo tumorigcnicity of these cells by injecting serial dilutions into immunodeficient mice. Inoculation of 10(6) cells per mouse led to rapid tumor formation, irrespective of cell line or culture conditions. However, after injection of only 103 cells, solely sphere cells were highly tumorigenic. In vitro, we investigated differentiation markers, established breast CSC markers and conducted mRNA profiling. Cytokeratin 5 and 18 were increased in both monolayer cell types, indicating a more differentiated phenotype. All cell lines were CD24(-)/CD44(+) and did not express CD133, CD326 or E-cadherin. ALDH1 activity was not detectable in any cell line. A verapamil-sensitive Hoechst side population was present in sphere cells, but there was no correlation with tumorigenicity in vivo. m RNA profiling did not reveal upregulation of relevant transcription factors. In vitro cell cycle kinetics and in vivo tumor doubling times displayed no difference between sphere and monolayer cultures. Our data indicate that intrinsic genetic and functional markers investigated are not indicative of the in vivo tumori-genicity of putative breast tumor-initiating cells.																	1019-6439					DEC	2012	41	6					1932	1942		10.3892/ijo.2012.1654							WOS:000311587900004	23042145

Expression of E-cadherin repressors SNAIL, ZEB1 and ZEB2 by tumour and stromal cells influences tumour-budding phenotype and suggests heterogeneity of stromal cells in pancreatic cancer	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER												Background: There is evidence that tumour-stroma interactions have a major role in the neoplastic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumour budding is thought to reflect the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, the relationship between tumour buds and EMT remains unclear. Here we characterize the tumour-budding-and stromal cells in PDAC at protein and mRNA levels concerning factors involved in EMT. Methods: mRNA in situ hybridisation and immunostaining for E-cadherin, beta-catenin, SNAIL1, ZEB1, ZEB2, N-cadherin and TWIST1 were assessed in the main tumour, tumour buds and tumour stroma on multipunch tissue microarrays from 120 well-characterised PDACs and associated with the clinicopathological features, including peritumoural (PTB) and intratumoural (ITB) budding. Results: Tumour-budding cells showed increased levels of ZEB1 (Po0.0001) and ZEB2 (P = 0.0119) and reduced E-cadherin and b-catenin (P<0.0001, each) compared with the main tumour. Loss of membranous beta-catenin in the main tumour (P = 0.0009) and tumour buds (P = 0.0053), without nuclear translocation, as well as increased SNAIL1 in tumour and stromal cells (P = 0.0002, each) correlated with high PTB. ZEB1 overexpression in the main tumour-budding and stromal cells was associated with high ITB (P = 0.0084; 0.0250 and 0.0029, respectively) and high PTB (P = 0.0005; 0.0392 and 0.0007, respectively). ZEB2 overexpression in stromal cells correlated with higher pT stage (P = 0.03), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.0172) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0152). Conclusions: In the tumour microenvironment of phenotypically aggressive PDAC, tumour-budding cells express EMT hallmarks at protein and mRNA levels underlining their EMT-type character and are surrounded by stromal cells expressing high levels of the E-cadherin repressors ZEB1, ZEB2 and SNAIL1, this being strongly associated with the tumour-budding phenotype. Moreover, our findings suggest the existence of subtypes of stromal cells in PDAC with phenotypical and functional heterogeneity.

Placental stem cells pre-treated with a hyaluronan mixed ester of butyric and retinoic acid to cure infarcted pig hearts: a multimodal study	CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH												Aims Pre-treating placenta-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (FMhMSCs) with a hyaluronan mixed ester of butyric and retinoic acid (HBR) potentiates their reparative capacity in rodent hearts. Our aim was to test FMhMSCs in a large-animal model by employing a novel combination of in vivo and ex vivo analyses. Methods and results Matched regional quantifications of myocardial function and viability were performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) 4 weeks after myocardial infarction combined with intramyocardial injection of FMhMSCs (n = 7), or HBR-pre-treated FMhMSCs (HBR-FMhMSCs, n = 6), or saline solution (PBS, n = 7). Sham-operated pigs (n = 4) were used as control animals. Despite no differences in the ejection fraction and haemodynamics, regional MRI revealed, in pigs treated with HBR-FMhMSCs compared with the other infarcted groups, a 40% smaller infarct scar size and a significant improvement of the end-systolic wall thickening and circumferential shortening of the infarct border zone. Consistently, PET showed that myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake were, respectively, 35 and 23% higher in the border zone of pigs treated with HBR-FMhMSCs compared with the other infarcted groups. Histology supported in vivo imaging; the delivery of HBR-FMhMSCs significantly enhanced capillary density and decreased fibrous tissue by approximately 68%. Moreover, proteomic analysis of the border zone in the HBR-FMhMSCs group and the FMhMSCs group indicated, respectively, 45 and 30% phenotypic homology with healthy tissue, while this homology was only 26% in the border zone of the PBS group. Conclusion Our results support a more pronounced reparative potential of HBR-pre-treated FMhMSCs in a clinically relevant animal model of infarction and highlight the necessity of using combined diagnostic imaging to avoid underestimations of stem cell therapeutic effects in the heart.				aquaro, giovanni donato/AAB-8978-2019; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea/I-7088-2012; Lionetti, Vincenzo/G-9528-2014; Ventura, Carlo/AAV-3658-2020; Neglia, Danilo/AAR-6384-2020; Lionetti, Vincenzo/AAN-1994-2020; Valente, Sabrina/ABI-1022-2020; Lionetti, Vincenzo/AAH-9503-2020; Mauri, Pietro Luigi/AAC-3095-2019; Cantoni, Silvia/H-3938-2011	Pasquinelli, Gianandrea/0000-0003-1506-1829; Lionetti, Vincenzo/0000-0002-0640-8651; Mauri, Pietro Luigi/0000-0003-4364-0393; Neglia, Danilo/0000-0003-0016-9538; di silvestre, dario/0000-0002-7143-6229; aquaro, giovanni donato/0000-0003-0915-915X; VALENTE, SABRINA/0000-0002-4090-291X; Cavallini, Claudia/0000-0002-8079-9697; Cantoni, Silvia/0000-0002-3866-3307												0008-6363					JUN	2011	90	3					546	556		10.1093/cvr/cvr018							WOS:000290820200021	21257613

Quantitative, Label-Free Characterization of Stem Cell Differentiation at the Single-Cell Level by Broadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Microscopy	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS												We use broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) microscopy to characterize lineage commitment of individual human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in adipogenic, osteogenic, and basal culture media. We treat hyperspectral images obtained by BCARS in two independent ways, obtaining robust metrics for differentiation. In one approach, pixel counts corresponding to functional markers, lipids, and minerals, are used to classify individual cells as belonging to one of the three lineage groups: adipocytes, osteoblasts, and undifferentiated stem cells. In the second approach, we use multivariate analysis of Raman spectra averaged exclusively over cytosol regions of individual cells to classify the cells into the same three groups, with consistent results. The exceptionally high speed of spectral imaging with BCARS allows us to chemically map a large number of cells with high spatial resolution, revealing not only the phenotype of individual cells, but also population heterogeneity in the degree of phenotype commitment.

Cytology analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the diagnostic gold standard, however, the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CSF (CSF-CTCs) are not well defined at the molecular and transcriptome levels. Methods We established an effective CSF-CTCs collection procedure and isolated individual CSF cells from five lung adenocarcinoma leptomeningeal metastases (LUAD-LM) patients and three controls. Three thousand seven hundred ninety-two single-cell transcriptomes were sequenced, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) gene expression analysis was used to perform a comprehensive characterization of CSF cells. Results Through clustering and expression analysis, we defined CSF-CTCs at the transcriptome level based on epithelial markers, proliferation markers, and genes with lung origin. The metastatic-CTC signature genes are enriched for metabolic pathway and cell adhesion molecule categories, which are crucial for the survival and metastases of tumor cells. We discovered substantial heterogeneity in patient CSF-CTCs. We quantified the degree of heterogeneity and found significantly greater among-patient heterogeneity compared to among-cell heterogeneity within a patient. This observation could be explained by spatial heterogeneity of metastatic sites, cell-cycle gene, and cancer-testis antigen (CTA) expression profiles as well as the proportion of CTCs displaying mesenchymal and cancer stem cell properties. In addition, our CSF-CTCs transcriptome profiling allowed us to determine the biomarkers during the progression of an LM patient with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP). Conclusions Our results will provide candidate genes for an RNA-based digital detection of CSF-CTCs from LUAD-LM and CUP-LM cases, and shed light on the therapy and mechanism of LUAD-LM.

Methods: RCTs that purported to use stem cells or MSCs to treat knee cartilage were identified with use of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). Study variables were compiled, and methodological quality was assessed. The cell treatments and the methods used to characterize them were recorded and compared. Clinical, radiographic, and arthroscopic outcomes were extracted and evaluated qualitatively. Results: There was extensive variation among the treatments, adjuvant therapies, and outcome measures. Treatments did not coincide with terminology. Significant differences in clinical outcomes were reported infrequently, and intra-group improvements or inter-group subscore differences were consistently highlighted, particularly when inter-group comparisons were left unreported. Conclusions: Overall, there are isolated cases in which positive efficacy results have been published, but our results suggest that the generally positive efficacy conclusions concerning stem cell therapy for knee cartilage pathology may be overstated. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the efficacy of stem cell therapies should not be considered in aggregate. Cells that are procured or processed differently produce entirely different drugs. When evaluating the efficacy of "stem cell" therapies, clinicians must consider the methodological quality, nomenclature, and inherent distinctness of each treatment.

The objectives of the study are to identify and characterize two head and neck cancer cell lines with regard CD44(high)/ CD133(high)/CD117(high) profile (CSCs) and CD44(low)/CD133(low)/CD117(low) profile (Non-CSCs); to investigate the influence of chemotherapy treatment in CSCs and compare with Non-CSCs; to evaluate CD44 and EGFR gene expression in CSCs. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) using specific cell surface marker combination (CD44, CD117 and CD133) was performed to isolate CSCs of Non-CSCs from cell lines. The Wound Healing assay was performed to confirm the presence of CSCs. After, the CSCs subpopulation and Non-CSCs were cultured and exposed for 24 h to Cetuximab and Paclitaxel treatment, separately. Cell proliferation was determined by MTS assay. CD44 and EGFR gene expression was quantified by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) using TaqMan (R) Assay in both subpopulations. CSCs subpopulation untreated were considered as relative expression control. We firstly characterized CSCs in HN13 and HEP-2 cell lines with CD44, CD133 and CD117 biomarkers. We treated CSCs and Non-CSCs subpopulations with Cetuximab and Paclitaxel treatment and found that CSCs subpopulations demonstrated more resistance to Paclitaxel chemoterapy, when compared with Non-CSCs subpopulations of oral cancer cell line. These CSCs subpopulations presented up-regulation of CD44 gene and down-regulation of EGFR gene in oral cancer cell line, and down-regulation of CD44 gene and up-regulation of EGFR gene in laryngeal cancer cell line when compared with Non-CSCs subpopulations. We conclude that the combination of CD44, CD133 and CD117 biomarkers have stem cell properties in both cell lines. CSCs has ability to resist to Paclitaxel treatment in oral cancer cell line. CSCs present high expression of CD44 gene and down expression of EGFR gene in oral cancer cell line. CSCs in laryngeal cell line present down expression of CD44 gene and high expression of EGFR gene when compared with cells without characteristics of cancer stem cells.				de Mendonca Fernandes, Glaucia Maria/C-8416-2018; Goloni-Bertollo, Eny Maria/B-8405-2012; Galbiatti-Dias, Ana Livia Silva/P-6679-2018; Pavarino, Erika C/L-5899-2016; Castanhole-Nunes, Marcia Maria U/B-2003-2009	de Mendonca Fernandes, Glaucia Maria/0000-0002-8113-3598; Goloni-Bertollo, Eny Maria/0000-0002-2622-4673; Galbiatti-Dias, Ana Livia Silva/0000-0002-4312-3954; Pavarino, Erika C/0000-0003-0959-0695; Castanhole-Nunes, Marcia Maria U/0000-0002-5506-8155; Antunes Muniz Ferreira, Leticia/0000-0003-4840-8753												2156-6976						2018	8	8					1633	1641									WOS:000443206500024	30210931

Transcriptome analysis demonstrated for the first time the upregulation of 115 and downregulation of 131 genes in CD271-MSCs. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in CD271-MSCs are significantly enriched for extracellular matrix (tenascin XB, elastin, ABI family, member 3 (NESH) binding protein, carboxypeptidase Z, laminin alpha 2 and nephroblastoma overexpressed) and cell adhesion (CXCR7, GPNMB, MYBPH, SVEP1, ARHGAP6, TSPEAR, PIK3CG, ABL2 and NCAM1). CD271-MSCs expressed higher gene transcript levels that are involved in early osteogenesis/chondrogenesis/adipogenesis (ZNF145, FKBP5). In addition, increased transcript levels for early and late osteogenesis (DPT, OMD, ID4, CRYAB, SORT1), adipogenesis (CTNNB1, ZEB, LPL, FABP4, PDK4, ACDC), and chondrogenesis (CCN3/NOV, CCN4/WISP1, CCN5/WISP2 and ADAMTS-5) were detected. Interestingly, CD271-MSCs expressed increased levels of hematopoiesis associated genes (CXCL12, FLT3L, IL-3, TPO, KITL). Down-regulated genes in CD271-MSCs were associated with WNT and TGF-beta signaling, and cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. In addition to their capacity to support hematopoiesis, these results suggest that CD271-MSCs may contain more osteo/chondro progenitors and/or feature a greater differentiation potential.

Therefore, a combination of markers is necessary to identify the cells. No comprehensive analysis of the immunophenotype of expanded plastic adherent ASCs has been published. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the general phenotype of cultured ASCs and to further analyze cellular subsets. ASCs were isolated from lipoaspirates from patients undergoing cosmetic liposuction and cultured in standard cell culture. A comprehensive phenotype characterization was done with the BD Lyoplate (TM) Human Cell Surface Marker Screening Panel containing 242 antibodies and isotype controls. Cultured ASCs not only showed the characteristic expression profile of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), but also revealed donor-specific variability in the expression of 49 other markers. We further detected markers with a scattering in the fluorescence intensity, indicating subpopulations with different expression profiles. Therefore, a multi-color flow cytometric analysis was done after staining the cells with direct-labeled antibodies against CD73, CD90, CD105, and either CD34, CD140b, CD200, CD201, or CD36 to verify the selected subpopulations of ASCs. We detected no CD34-CD36 double-positive population, but CD34(+)-CD36(-) and CD34(-)CD36(+) subpopulations, both of which are positive for the 3 main MSC markers, CD73, CD90, and CD105. All other detected subpopulations also co-expressed the 3 main MSC markers, and therefore fulfill the minimal phenotypic criteria for the definition of cultured MSCs. Our study demonstrates the first comprehensive phenotypic characterization of ASCs and clearly highlights donor-specific variability in ASC preparations.

However, most patients eventually experience tumour recurrence, treatment failure and metastatic dissemination with fatal consequences. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of resistance to radio- and chemotherapy, we exposed human cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7 and DU145) to clinically relevant doses of 5-azacytidine or ionizing radiation and compared the transcript profiles of all surviving cell subpopulations, including low-adherent stem-like cells. Stress-mobilized low-adherent cell fractions differed from other survivors in terms of deregulation of hundreds of genes, including those involved in interferon response. Exposure of cancer cells to interferon-gamma but not interferon-beta resulted in the development of a heterogeneous, low-adherent fraction comprising not only apoptotic/necrotic cells but also live cells exhibiting active Notch signalling and expressing stem-cell markers. Chemical inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) or siRNA-mediated knockdown of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and interferon responsible factor 1 (IRF1) prevented mobilization of the surviving low-adherent population, indicating that interferon-gamma-mediated loss of adhesion and anoikis resistance required an active Erk pathway interlinked with interferon signalling by transcription factor IRF1. Notably, a skin-specific protein suprabasin (SBSN), a recently identified oncoprotein, was among the top scoring genes upregulated in surviving low-adherent cancer cells induced by 5-azacytidine or irradiation. SBSN expression required the activity of the MEK/Erk pathway, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SBSN suppressed the low-adherent fraction in irradiated, interferon-gamma- and 5-azacytidine-treated cells, respectively, implicating SBSN in genotoxic stress-induced phenotypic plasticity and stress resistance. Importantly, SBSN expression was observed in human clinical specimens of colon and ovarian carcinomas, as well as in circulating tumour cells and metastases of the 4T1 mouse model. The association of SBSN expression with progressive stages of cancer development indicates its role in cancer evolution and therapy resistance.

A dynamic in vivo model of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in circulating tumor cells and metastases of breast cancer	ONCOGENE												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes endow epithelial cells with enhanced migratory/invasive properties and are therefore likely to contribute to tumor invasion and metastatic spread. Because of the difficulty in following EMT processes in human tumors, we have developed and characterized an animal model with transplantable human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-468) uniquely showing spontaneous EMT events to occur. Using vimentin as a marker of EMT, heterogeneity was revealed in the primary MDA-MB-468 xenografts with vimentin-negative and vimentin-positive areas, as also observed on clinical human invasive breast tumor specimens. Reverse transcriptase-PCR after microdissection of these populations from the xenografts revealed EMT traits in the vimentin-positive zones characterized by enhanced 'mesenchymal gene' expression (Snail, Slug and fibroblast-specific protein-1) and diminished expression of epithelial molecules (E-cadherin, ZO-3 and JAM-A). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected in the blood as soon as 8 days after s.c. injection, and lung metastases developed in all animals injected as examined by in vivo imaging analyses and histology. High levels of vimentin RNA were detected in CTCs by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR as well as, to a lesser extent, Snail and Slug RNA. Von Willebrand Factor/vimentin double immunostainings further showed that tumor cells in vascular tumoral emboli all expressed vimentin. Tumoral emboli in the lungs also expressed vimentin whereas macrometastases displayed heterogenous vimentin expression, as seen in the primary xenografts. In conclusion, our data uniquely demonstrate in an in vivo context that EMT occurs in the primary tumors, and associates with an enhanced ability to intravasate and generate CTCs. They further suggest that mesenchymal-to-epithelial phenomena occur in secondary organs, facilitating the metastatic growth.

In our lab, we found that MSC preparations from bone marrow of many different donors had a limited capacity of in vitro differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages-a capacity claimed to be inherent to MSCs. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that the amount of heparin used as anticoagulant during bone marrow harvest had an inhibitory influence on the in vitro differentiation capacity of isolated MSCs. Bone marrow was obtained from the femoral cavity of twelve donors during total hip arthroplasty in the absence or presence of heparin. No coagulation was observed in the absence of heparin. The number of mononuclear cells was independent of heparin addition. Isolated MSCs were characterized by morphology, population doubling times, expression of cell surface antigens and in vitro differentiation. Results of these analyses were independent of the amount of heparin. Transcriptome analyses of cells from three randomly chosen donors and quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis from cells of all donors demonstrated no clear effect of heparin on the transcriptome of the cells. This excludes heparin as a potential source of disparate results.

Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have aimed to recapitulate the main components of the bone marrow (BM) niche. Nonetheless, the models are limited by a lack of heterogeneity and compound structure. Here, we fabricated coaxial extruded core-shell tubular scaffolds and extrusion-based bioprinted cell-laden mesh scaffolds to mimic the functional niche in vitro. A multicellular mesh scaffold and two different core-shell tubular scaffolds were developed with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) in comparison with a conventional 2D coculture system. A clear cell-cell connection was established in all three bioprinted constructs. Cell distribution and morphology were observed in different systems with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Collected hCB-CD34+ cells were characterized by various stem cell-specific and lineage-specific phenotypic parameters. The results showed that compared with hCB-CD34+ cells cocultured with BMSCs in Petri dishes, the self-renewal potential of hCB-CD34+ cells was stronger in the tubular scaffolds after 14 days. Besides, cells in these core-shell constructs tended to obtain stronger differentiation potential of lymphoid and megakaryocytes, while cells encapsulated in mesh scaffolds obtained stronger differentiation tendency into erythroid cells. Consequently, 3D bioprinting technology could partially simulate the niche of human hematopoietic stem cells. The three models have their potential in stemness maintenance and multilineage differentiation. This study can provide initial effective guidance in the directed differentiation research and related screening of drug models for hematological diseases.																	2373-9878					JUN 14	2021	7	6					2592	2604		10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01297							WOS:000662265300050	33939424

However, the rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs as well as the difficulties of primary culture limit their practical application. Establishing efficient in vitro culture methods and functionally characterizing CTCs is essential for cancer studies. To this end, we developed an experimental protocol for the isolation, expansion, and identification of breast cancer CTCs. Methods: The CTC-3 cell line was established from peripheral blood cells of a breast cancer patient. A karyotype analysis was performed. The molecular profile was assessed by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot. The characteristics of tumors formed by CTC-3 cells were evaluated by cell growth and tumor sphere formation assays and in a mouse xenograft model. The tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence analysis, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: The CTC-3 cell line showed more aggressive growth both in vitro and in vivo than the widely used MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. CTC-3 cells were also more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, and gene profiling indicated higher expression levels of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness markers as compared to MCF-7 cells. Conclusions: CTC-3 cells are a better model for investigating the malignant behavior of breast cancer than existing cell lines.

Here we describe a functional role and the prognostic value of PROX1 in glioblastoma. Low expression of PROX1 correlated with poor overall survival and the mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype signature. The latter finding was recapitulated in vitro, where suppression or overexpression of PROX1 in glioma cell cultures transitioned cells to a mesenchymal or to a nonmesenchymal glioblastoma gene expression signature, respectively. PROX1 modulation affected proliferation rates that coincided with changes in protein levels of CCNA1 and CCNE1 as well as the cyclin inhibitors CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C. Overexpression of SOX2 increased PROX1 expression, but treatment with a CDK2 inhibitor subsequently decreased PROX1 expression, which was paralleled by decreased SOX2 levels. The THRAP3 protein was a novel binding partner for PROX1, and suppression of THRAP3 increased both transcript and protein levels of PROX1. Together, these findings highlight the prognostic value of PROX1 and its role as a regulator of glioblastoma gene expression subtypes, intratumoral heterogeneity, proliferation, and cell-cycle control. Significance: These findings demonstrate the role and prognostic value of PROX1 in glioblastomas; low PROX1 levels correlate with a mesenchymal gene expression subtype and shorter survival in glioblastoma tumors.

Targeting BCSCs may ameliorate therapy resistance, tumor growth, and metastatic progression. However, the origin and molecular mechanisms underlying their cellular properties are poorly understood. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) promotes mammary stem/progenitor cell (MaSC) expansion and maintenance but also confers stem-like traits to differentiated tumor cells. Here, we describe the rapid generation of experimentally induced BCSCs by TAZ-mediated reprogramming of human mammary epithelial cells, hence allowing for the direct analysis of BCSC phenotypes. Specifically, we establish genetically well-defined TAZ-dependent (TAZ(DEP)) and -independent (TAZ(IND)) cell lines with cancer stem cell (CSC) traits, such as self-renewal, variable resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and tumor seeding potential. TAZ(DEP) cells were associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, embryonic, and MaSC signature genes. In contrast, TAZ(IND) cells were characterized by a neuroendocrine transdifferentiation transcriptional program associated with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Mechanistically, we identify Cyclin D1 (CCND1) as a critical downstream effector for TAZ-driven tumorigenesis. Overall, our results reveal a critical TAZ-CCND1-CDK4/CDK6 signaling axis, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches to eliminate both BCSCs and therapy-resistant cancer cells.																	2296-634X					JUN 15	2021	9								673374	10.3389/fcell.2021.673374							WOS:000667668300001	34211974

We evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics of a cohort of 246 Chinese patients in relation to the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers in benign, borderline and malignant tumors and the prognostic value of different surgical regimens. We observed that survival outcomes correlated with the mode of surgical management in the three patient groups. Expression of E-cadherin, Snail, Slug and Twist were higher in epithelial cells from borderline and malignant tumors than those in benign tumors, whereas the expression of N-cadherin was opposite. Levels of the EMT markers Snail and Slug in the stromal compartment increased with the advancing tumor grade. Expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers contributed to the inherent heterogeneity in the malignant tumors. Based on Cox models, surgical management emerged as an independent predictor for disease-free survival, whereas a history of recent growth and tumor grade were independent predictors for overall survival. These findings show that expression of EMT markers, the mode of surgical management, and a history of recent tumor growth had prognostic potential for patients with phyllodes tumors of the breast.																		1949-2553				MAY 16	2017	8	20					33365	33374		10.18632/oncotarget.16497							WOS:000401767700080	28380418

Despite this functional heterogeneity, BMSCs continue to be utilized for many applications due to the lack of definitive and universally accepted markers to prospectively identify and purify SSCs. Isolation is widely based on adherence to tissue culture plastic; however, high hematopoietic contamination is a significant impediment in murine models. Remarkably, when cultured at a physiological oxygen tension of 1% O-2, a 10-fold reduction in CD45(+) hematopoietic cells associated with a concomitant increase in PDGFR alpha(+) stromal cells occur. This is due, in part, to a differential response of the two populations to hypoxia. In standard tissue culture conditions of 21% O-2, CD45(+) cells showed increased proliferation coupled with no changes in cell death compared to their counterparts grown at 1% O-2. In contrast, PDGFR alpha(+) stromal cells responded to hypoxia by increasing proliferation and exhibiting a 10-fold decrease in cell death. In summary, we describe a simple and reliable method exploiting the divergent biological response of hematopoietic and stromal cells to hypoxia to significantly increase the PDGFR alpha(+) stromal cell population in murine BMSC cultures.																	1873-5061	1876-7753				MAY	2021	53								102317	10.1016/j.scr.2021.102317							WOS:000663439200009	33848794

However, intratumoral heterogeneity of bile duct carcinoma (BDC) is rarely studied. Methods: Two highly heterogeneous cell lines named EH-CA1a and EH-CA1b were established from a primary tumor tissue of a pathologically proven BDC. Distinct heterogeneity and underlying mechanisms of two cell lines in karyotype, colony formation, tumorgenicity, and sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy were intensively studied. Results: Both cell lines showed typical morphology of cancer cells. EH-CA1a cells grew as free-floating aggregates, while EH-CA1b cells grew adherently as a monolayer. EH-CA1 alpha cells had higher cloning efficiencies and were able to keep proliferating under hypoxic condition. Coincidentally, hypoxia-induced factor-1a (HIF1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA were significantly higher in EH-CA1a cells than in EH-CA1b cells. Both cell lines were tumorigenic in nude mouse, however, EH-CA1a cells showed more aggressive characteristics. Most importantly, the EH-CA1a cells showed much more resistance against radiation and chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Metastasis-related genes including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as Vimentin, Snail, and Twist, are more highly expressed in EH-CA1a cells than in EH-CA1b cells. Moreover, the percentage of cells expressing cancer stem cell-like marker, CD133, in EH-CA1a cells is much higher than that in EH-CA1b cells. Moreover, knockdown of CD133 in both EH-CA1a and EH-CA1b cells significantly reduced their invasive potential and increased their sensitivities to radiation and gemcitabine, suggesting the differential expression of CD133 protein may partially account for the difference in malignancy between these two cancer cells. Conclusion: Establishment of these two cell lines will not only shed light on intratumoral heterogeneities of BDC, but also potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches of BDC.

However the identity of BM MSC subpopulations is poorly defined mainly due to the absence of specific markers allowing in situ localization of those cells and isolation of pure cell types. Here, we aimed at characterization of surface markers in mouse BM MSCs and in their subsets with distinct differentiation potential. Using conditionally immortalized BM MSCs we performed a screening with 176 antibodies and high-throughput flow cytometry, and found 33 markers expressed in MSCs, and among them 3 were novel for MSCs and 13 have not been reported for MSCs from mice. Furthermore, we obtained clonally derived MSC subpopulations and identified bipotential progenitors capable for osteo-and adipogenic differentiation, as well as monopotential osteogenic and adipogenic clones, and thus confirmed heterogeneity of MSCs. We found that expression of CD200 was characteristic for the clones with osteogenic potential, whereas SSEA4 marked adipogenic progenitors lacking osteogenic capacity, and CD140a was expressed in adipogenic cells independently of their efficiency for osteogenesis. We confirmed our observations in cell sorting experiments and further investigated the expression of those markers during the course of differentiation. Thus, our findings provide to our knowledge the most comprehensive characterization of surface antigens expression in mouse BM MSCs to date, and suggest CD200, SSEA4 and CD140a as markers differentially expressed in distinct types of MSC progenitors.

Recent studies have shown that TNBC can be classified into 6 subtypes, including basal-like, mesenchymal-like, and mesenchymal stem-like subtypes. However, clinical significance of the EMT in TNBC remains unclear. We analyzed immunohistochemical expression of EMT-related markers, including EMT markers (expression of vimentin, smooth muscle actin, osteonectin, and N-cadherin; loss of E-cadherin), EMT inducers (ZEB1 and CD146), and breast cancer stem cell markers (CD44(+)/CD24(-) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1) in 173 TNBCs and correlated their expression with clinicopathological features of the tumors, including clinical outcome. Expressions of vimentin, CD44(+)/CD24(-), and CD146 were more frequent in basal-like TNBCs than non-basal-like TNBCs. Whereas CD146 expression was closely associated with the expression of various EMT markers and CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype, ZEB1 expression correlated only with the expression of smooth muscle actin. Expressions of vimentin, smooth muscle actin, osteonectin, and ZEB1 and loss of E-cadherin were more frequently found in metaplastic carcinomas than in other histologic subtypes. In survival analyses, EMT markers were not associated with patients' clinical outcomes. However, ZEB1 expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival. These findings indicate that expression of EMT-related markers in TNBCs can be a signature of a certain subgroup of TNBC, which is associated with metaplastic carcinoma, and ZEB1 expression can serve as a potential biomarker to define a subgroup of TNBC associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Recent reports have proved that fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells share much more in common than previously recognized. The aim of this study was to investigate comparative studies in fibroblasts on the differences in the expression of molecular markers and differentiation capacity from different organs. Methods: Combined trypsin/collagenase enzymes digestion method was used to isolate and culture the fibroblasts derived from heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and skin. Cell activity was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Common molecular markers for fibroblasts such as vimentin, DDR2 and FSP1, stem cell markers nanog, c-kit and sca-1 were detected by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The osteogenic, adipogenic and cardiogenic differentiations of fibroblasts were performed by inductive culture in special mediums, and analyzed by Alizarin red, Oil red O and immunofluorescence staining of cTnT respectively. Results: The proliferation rate of fibroblasts in lung was faster than in other five organs. Common molecular markers for fibroblasts were expressed differently in different organs. DDR2 was strongly expressed in fibroblasts in the heart, partly expressed in the heart, skin, liver and spleen. Interestingly, no expression of DDR2 was detected in liver and kidney. However, vimentin and FSP1 were consistently expressed in fibroblasts from skin, liver, kidney, spleen and lung. nanog expression in fibroblasts from lung was less than that from heart, skin, liver and spleen (P < 0.01). c-kit expression in fibroblasts from heart, skin and kidney was higher than that from spleen (P < 0.05), while the c-kit positive fibroblasts from liver was obviously higher than that from spleen (P < 0.01). But sca-1 expression in fibroblasts from lung was the lowest among six organs (P < 0.01). Directed differentiation in vitro had demonstrated that skin fibroblasts had the strongest multiple differentiation potential, and the next was cardiac fibroblasts. And fibroblasts in liver and kidney had the advantage in myocardial differentiation, while fibroblasts in spleen only had the advantage in osteogenic differentiation. Conclusions: There are obvious heterogeneity in molecular markers and muti-directional differentiation in fibroblasts from six organs. (C) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

O-GlcNAc Transferase Regulates Cancer Stem-like Potential of Breast Cancer Cells	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH												Breast tumors are heterogeneous and composed of different subpopulation of cells, each with dynamic roles that can change with stage, site, and microenvironment. Cellular heterogeneity is, in part, due to cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that share properties with stem cells and are associated with treatment resistance. CSCs rewire metabolism to meet energy demands of increased growth and biosynthesis. O-GlcNAc transferase enzyme (OGT) uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate for adding O-GlcNAc moieties to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. OGT/O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in multiple cancers and reducing OGT in cancer cells blocks tumor growth. Here, we report that breast CSCs enriched in mammo-sphere cultures contain elevated OGT/O-GlcNAcylation. Inhibition of OGT genetically or pharmacologically reduced mammosphere forming efficiency, the CD44(H)/CD24(L), NANOG+, and ALDH+ CSC population in breast cancer cells. Conversely, breast cancer cells overexpressing OGT increased mammosphere formation, CSC populations in vitro, and also increased tumor initiation and CSC frequency in vivo. Furthermore, OGT regulates expression of a number of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and CSC markers including CD44, NANOG, and c-Myc. In addition, we identify Kruppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) as a novel regulator of breast cancer mammosphere formation and a critical target of OGT in regulating CSCs.				; Reginato, Mauricio/I-6155-2013	Akella, Neha Manjari/0000-0003-1827-1768; Reginato, Mauricio/0000-0002-7541-4094												1541-7786	1557-3125				APR	2020	18	4					585	598		10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-0732							WOS:000522839400007	31974291

Intratumoral Heterogeneity in a Trp53-Null Mouse Model of Human Breast Cancer	CANCER DISCOVERY												Intratumoral heterogeneity correlates with clinical outcome and reflects the cellular complexity and dynamics within a tumor. Such heterogeneity is thought to contribute to radio-and chemoresistance because many treatments may target only certain tumor cell subpopulations. A better understanding of the functional interactions between various subpopulations of cells, therefore, may help in the development of effective cancer treatments. We identified a unique subpopulation of tumor cells expressing mesenchymal-like markers in a Trp53-null mouse model of basal-like breast cancer using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and microarray analysis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed the existence of cross-talk between these "mesenchymal-like" cells and tumor-initiating cells. Knockdown of genes encoding ligands upregulated in the mesenchymal cells and their corresponding receptors in the tumor-initiating cells resulted in reduced tumorigenicity and increased tumor latency. These studies illustrate the non-cell-autonomous properties and importance of cooperativity between tumor subpopulations. SIGNIFICANCE: Intratumoral heterogeneity has been considered one important factor in assessing a patient's initial response to treatment and selecting drug regimens to effectively increase tumor response rate. Elucidating the functional interactions between various subpopulations of tumor cells will help provide important new insights in understanding treatment response and tumor progression.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are intrinsically resistant to most chemotherapy agents, exhibit considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in their epithelial versus mesenchymal states. However, the drug response of CSCs in the epithelial and mesenchymal states has not been completely investigated. In this study, we found that epithelial-type (E-cadherin(high)/CD133(high)) CSCs displayed a higher sphere formation ability and chemoresistance than mesenchymal-type (E-cadherin(low)CD133(high)) CSCs. Gene expression profiling of the CSC and non-CSC subpopulations with distinct epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states showed that MyoD family inhibitor domain-containing (MDFIC) was selectively upregulated in epithelial-type CSCs. Knockdown of MDFIC sensitized epithelial-type CSCs to chemotherapy agents. Ectopic expression of MDFIC increased the chemoresistance of mesenchymal-type CSCs. In a tissue microarray, high MDFIC expression was associated with poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A mechanistic study showed that the MDFIC p32 isoform, which is located in the cytoplasm, interacted with the destruction complex, Axin/GSK-3/beta-catenin. This interaction stabilized beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin phosphorylation at S33/37 and increased the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. Knockdown of beta-catenin decreased MDFIC-enhanced chemoresistance. These results suggested that the upregulation of MDFIC enhanced the chemoresistance of epithelial-type CSCs by elevating beta-catenin activity. Thus, targeting MDFIC-regulated beta-catenin signaling of epithelial-type CSCs may be a potential strategy to overcome chemoresistance in NSCLC.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been extensively studied for the treatment of schistosomiasis. However, the mechanism by which MSCs modulate the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis has not been clarified. Furthermore, the local inflammatory milieu may greatly influence the immunoregulatory properties of MSCs, and our early experiments demonstrated that Toll-like receptor (TLR)2/TLR4 agonist effected immune modulation of MSC. Here, we further investigated their modulation on the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis.MethodsAdult BALB/c male mice were percutaneously infected with 162 pairs S. japonicum cercariae and received intravenously pretreated MSC at 1week and 3weeks post-infection, respectively. At 8weeks post-infection, effects of MSC on liver histology were shown by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson staining and quantitatively compared by the hepatic hydroxyproline content; alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen type I(Col-1), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expression in the liver were assessed by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR); the Th1/Th2 dominance among different groups was compared by analyzing CD4(+) interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)+ and CD4+interleukin-4 (IL-4)+T cells in the liver by flow cytometry and serum level of IFN-gamma and IL-5 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Effects of different kinds of MSC were further evaluated in vitro by the coculture system.ResultsResults showed TLR4- and IFN-gamma-activated MSC alleviated liver fibrosis in infected mice, without a significant increase of mortality, and unpretreated MSC showed no clear improvement; however, TLR2- and IFN-gamma-activated MSC displayed aggravated immunopathology. In accord with the pathological results, TLR4- and IFN-gamma-activated MSC groups showed moderate enhancement of Th1 response in vitro and clear Th1 dominance in vivo without leading to extreme inflammation, whereas TLR2- and IFN-gamma-activated MSC not only induced Th1 response, but also triggered excessive inflammation as evidenced by atrophy of the thymus and higher TNF level in the coculture system.Conclusions This study demonstrates that TLR4 combined with IFN-gamma can activate the MSC group with positive effects on the pathology of schistosomiasis by modulating Th subsets at some degree. This result suggests that when MSC is being used to treat different immuno-disturbance complications, subtle pretreatment methods should be seriously considered.																		1757-6512				JUN 5	2020	11	1							217	10.1186/s13287-020-01735-2							WOS:000540236200002	32503644

LncRNAs are involved in the regulation of a diverse array of biological processes, including cancer progression. An evolutionarily conserved lncRNA TUNA, was found to be required for pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells. In this study, we found the human ortholog of TUNA, linc00617, was upregulated in breast cancer samples. Linc00617 promoted motility and invasion of breast cancer cells and induced epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), which was accompanied by generation of stem cell properties. Moreover, knockdown of linc00617 repressed lung metastasis in vivo. We demonstrated that linc00617 upregulated the expression of stemness factor Sox2 in breast cancer cells, which was shown to promote the oncogenic activity of breast cancer cells by stimulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhancing the tumor-initiating capacity. Thus, our data indicate that linc00617 functions as an important regulator of EMT and promotes breast cancer progression and metastasis via activating the transcription of Sox2. Together, it suggests that linc00617 may be a potential therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancer.

The aim of the present meta-analysis was to systematically review the therapeutic role of MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or MSCs released by extracellular vesicles (Evs) for the treatment of AKI in rodent models. Studies were identified using PubMed and Scopus databases using a custom search strategy and eligibility criteria. Data regarding serum creatinine (SCr) concentration, CM or Evs, measurement time point, AKI model (toxic or non-toxic) and other parameters, including delivery route, animal type and animal numbers, were extracted. Pooled analysis and subgroup analysis as well as multivariable meta-regression were performed. Heterogeneity and publication bias were also investigated. A total of 13 studies were included and analyzed. Pooled analysis showed reduced SCr (0.93 [0.67, 1.20], mg/dl) in rodent models of AKI after CM/Evs therapy. The results of the subgroup analysis suggested that Evs induced an increased therapeutic effect, in the form of SCr reduction, as compared with CM (P=0.05). There were also other significant influential factors for SCr reduction including measurement time point (P=0.0004) and therapeutic time point (P<0.0001) after surgery. By contrast, parameters such as delivery route, injury type and cell type were not significant influential factors. Multivariable meta-regression analysis showed that measurement time point (P=0.041), therapeutic time point (P=0.03), Evs or CM (P=0.0003) and cell type (P<0.0001) were influential factors in the reduction of SCr. The present meta-analysis indicates that CM or Evs derived from MSCs are able to improve the impaired renal function in rodents modelling AKI. Compared with CM, Evs may produce a more marked therapeutic effect in recovery from renal failure. In addition, CM or Evs administration in early stages of AKI may result in more evident effects.

As it has been demonstrated that there are molecular changes at the end-plate during the early stages of motorneuron degeneration in animal models, we hypothesize that the local effect of this stem cell delivery method could slow the progressive loss of motor units (MUs) in ALS patients. Methods We designed a Phase I/II clinical trial to study the safety of intramuscularly implanting autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), including stem cells, in ALS patients and their possible effects on the MU of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Twenty-two patients participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that consisted of a baseline visit followed by one intramuscular injection of BMNCs, follow-up visits at 30, 90, 180, and 360 days, and an additional year of clinical follow-up. In each patient, one TA muscle was injected with a single dose of BMMCs while the contralateral muscle was given a placebo; the sides were selected randomly. All visits included a complete EMG study of both TA muscles. Results Our results show that (1) the intramuscular injection of BMMCs is a safe procedure; (2) ALS patients show heterogeneities in the degree of TA injury; (3) a comparison of placebo-injected muscles with BMMC-injected muscles showed significant differences in only one parameter, the D50 index used to quantify the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) scan curve. This parameter was higher in the BMMC-injected TA muscle at both 90 days (placebo side: 29.55 +/- 2.89, n = 20; experimental side: 39.25 +/- 3.21, n = 20; p < 0.01) and 180 days (placebo side: 29.35 +/- 3.29, n = 17; experimental side: 41.24 +/- 3.34, n = 17; p < 0.01). Conclusion This procedure had no effect on the TA muscle MU properties, with the exception of the D50 index. Finding differences in just this index supports the fact that it may be much more sensitive than other electrophysiological parameters when studying treatment effects. Given the low number of patients and their heterogeneity, these results justify exploring the efficacy of this procedure in further patients and other muscles, through Phase II trials.

Comparison of the immunomodulatory effect of single MSC batches versus pooled MSC products	CELL AND TISSUE BANKING												Severe corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is a major non-relapse cause of mortality and morbidity after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). One of the most promising treatment options is using advanced therapy medicinal products based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) immunomodulation ability. The protocols of MSC application differ in many parameters including a source of MSC, a dose, a number of doses or way of preparation of the medicinal product. The process is limited by the need for laborious and expensive manufacturing processes fraught with batch-to-batch variability. In our study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects of different MSC batches versus pooled MSC, specifically the influence on lymphocyte proliferation, the metabolic activity, and the expression of activation markers on T cells. Our goal was to determine whether the effect depends on donor-to-donor heterogeneity and if pooling of MSCs could increase their immunomodulatory ability. All tested batches showed an immunomodulatory effect, with no significant differences between the groups. Our study suggests that immunosuppressive potential is comparable in single batches and pooled products, and the use of products got from individual donors is suitable to treat corticosteroid-refractory GVHD.				; Vlas, Tomas/J-4058-2017	Holubova, Monika/0000-0002-5096-9659; Vlas, Tomas/0000-0002-4835-6511; Cedikova, Miroslava/0000-0003-1505-5971; Jindra, Pavel/0000-0002-8415-7069												1389-9333	1573-6814				MAR	2020	21	1					119	129		10.1007/s10561-019-09805-3		DEC 2019					WOS:000503678100001	31863261					
J	Niemeyer, P; Hirschmann, MT				Niemeyer, Philipp; Hirschmann, Michael T.			Future perspectives of stem cell therapy in Germany. Chondral therapy between regulation, scientific evidence and marketing	ARTHROSKOPIE												Stem cell therapy for the treatment of cartilage damage and osteoarthritis is awidely discussed topic of increasing interest. For both clinicians and patients it is considered ahighly attractive therapeutic approach associated with ahigh degree of innovation. Nevertheless, the field of cell therapy does not seem to be unproblematic. Thus, cell and tissue therapeutic agents are controlled in Germany by the regulation for drugs for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) and there is awide heterogeneity in the possibilities of application. In addition, the currently available limited scientific evidence is difficult to classify. It is not only against this background that, from the authors' point of view, controlled studies with specific questions need to be performed before these therapeutic approaches are offered to patients in the daily routine. This article covers the different aspects of the current problem in relation to the application of cell and tissue therapies in Germany.																	0933-7946	1434-3924				MAY	2019	32	3					205	211		10.1007/s00142-019-0279-1							WOS:000467795400008

Synovial macrophages play a critical immunomodulatory role in the acute inflammatory response surrounding joint injury. Due to the contrasting differences and heterogeneity of macrophage, the phenotype of macrophages are the key determinants of the healing response after cartilage injury. Biomaterials derived from extracellular matrix have been used for the repair and reconstruction of a variety of tissues by modulating the host macrophage response. However, the immunomodulatory effect of decellularized cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) on macrophages has not been elucidated. It is necessary to clarify the immunomodulatory properties of decellularized cartilage matrix (DCM) to guide the design of cartilage regeneration materials. Here, we prepared porcine articular cartilage derived DCM and determined the response of mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) to the pepsin-solubilized DCM (PDCM) in vitro . Macrophages activated by the PDCM could promote bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) invasion, migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic differentiation. Then, we verified that early optimization of the immunomodulatory effects of the cell-free DCM scaffold using IL-4 in vivo could achieve good cartilage regeneration in a rat knee osteochondral defect model. Therefore, this decellularized cartilage ECM scaffold combined with accurate and active immunomodulatory strategies provides a new approach for the development of cartilage regeneration materials. Statement of significance This work reports a decellularized cartilage extracellular matrix (DCM) scaffold combined with an accurate and active immunomodulatory strategy to improve cartilage regeneration. Our findings demonstrated that the pepsin-solubilized DCM (PDCM) activated bone marrow-derived macrophages to polarize to a constructive macrophage phenotype. These polarized macrophages promoted bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell invasion, migration, proliferation, and chondrogenic differentiation. DCM scaffolds combined with early-stage intra-articular injection of IL-4 created a wound-healing microenvironment and improved cartilage regeneration in a rat knee osteochondral defect model.					li, jun qi/0000-0003-3457-4099												1742-7061	1878-7568				JUN	2021	127						131	145		10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.054							WOS:000653397700008	33812074

Using a reference-panel-based statistical approach, the cell type composition of heterogeneous tissues can be estimated by comparison of whole tissue DNA methylation profiles with cell type-specific DNA methylation signatures. Currently, there is no adequate DNA methylation reference panel for CT, and existing CB panels have been generated on lower coverage Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays. In this study, we generate a reference panel for CT and improve available CB panels by using the higher coverage Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays. We performed DNA methylation profiling of 9 cell types isolated from CT and CB samples from 14 neonates. In addition to these cell types, we profiled DNA methylation of unfractionated CT and CB. Cell type composition of these unfractionated tissue samples, as estimated by our reference panels, was in agreement with that obtained by flow cytometry. Expectedly, DNA methylation profiles from CT and CB were distinct, reflecting their mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell origins. Variable CpGs from both unfractionated CT and its isolated cell types were more likely to be located in open seas and intronic regions than those in CB. Cell type specific CpGs in CT were enriched in intercellular matrix pathways, while those from CB were enriched in immune-related pathways. This study provides an open source reference panel for estimation and adjustment of cellular heterogeneity in CT and CB, and broadens the scope of tissue utilization assessed in future neonatal EWAS studies.

IEE cells further differentiate into enamel-forming ameloblasts, which play distinct roles, and are essential for enamel formation. These are conventionally classified by their shape, although their transcriptome and biological roles are yet to be fully understood. Here, we aimed to use single-cell RNA sequencing to clarify the heterogeneity of dental epithelial cell types. Unbiased clustering of 6,260 single cells from incisors of postnatal day 7 mice classified them into two clusters of ameloblast, IEE/OEE, SI/SR, and two mesenchymal populations. Secretory-stage ameloblasts expressedAmelandEnamwere divided intoDspp+ andAmbn+ ameloblasts. Pseudo-time analysis indicatedDspp+ ameloblasts differentiate intoAmbn+ ameloblasts. Further,DsppandAmbncould be stage-specific markers of ameloblasts. Gene ontology analysis of each cluster indicated potent roles of cell types: OEE in the regulation of tooth size and SR in the transport of nutrients. Subsequently, we identified novel dental epithelial cell marker genes, namelyPttg1,Atf3,Cldn10, andKrt15. The results not only provided a resource of transcriptome data in dental cells but also contributed to the molecular analyses of enamel formation.

Recently, Drop-seq single-cell RNA sequencing technology for measuring gene expression from thousands of individual cells identified the different cell types in the developing kidney. However, that analysis did not include the additional layer of heterogeneity that alternative mRNA splicing creates. Methods Full transcript length single-cell RNA sequencing characterized the transcriptomes of 544 individual cells from mouse embryonic kidneys. Results Gene expression levels measured with full transcript length single-cell RNA sequencing identified each cell type. Further analysis comprehensively characterized splice isoform switching during the transition between mesenchymal and epithelial cellular states, which is a key transitional process in kidney development. The study also identified several putative splicing regulators, including the genes Esrp1/2 and Rbfox1/2. Conclusions Discovery of the sets of genes that are alternatively spliced as the fetal kidney mesenchyme differentiates into tubular epithelium will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive kidney development.

Sequential genetic mutations, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, interaction with local stroma, and formation of hybrids between cancer cells and normal bone marrow-derived cells have been advocated as tumor progression mechanisms. We report herein the spontaneous in vitro formation of heterotypic hybrids between human bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and two different breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (MDA) and MA11. Hybrids showed predominantly mesenchymal morphological characteristics, mixed gene expression profiles, and increased DNA ploidy. Both MA11 and MDA hybrids were tumorigenic in inununodeficient mice, and some MDA hybrids had an increased metastatic capacity. Both in culture and as xenografts, hybrids underwent DNA ploidy reduction and morphological reversal to breast carcinoma-like morphological characteristics, while maintaining a mixed breast cancer-mesenchymal expression profile. Analysis of coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms by RNA sequencing revealed genetic contributions from both parental partners to hybrid tumors and metastasis. Because MSCs migrate and localize to breast carcinoma, our findings indicate that formation of MSC-breast cancer cell hybrids is a potential mechanism of the generation of invasive/metastatic breast cancer cells. Our findings reconcile the fusion theory of cancer progression with the common observation that breast cancer metastases are generally aneuploid, but not tetraploid, and are histopathologically similar to the primary neoplasm.

Glioblastomas within the Subventricular Zone Are Region-Specific Enriched for Mesenchymal Transition Markers: An Intratumoral Gene Expression Analysis	CANCERS												Simple Summary Involvement of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in glioblastoma is associated with poor prognosis and is associated with specific tumor-biological characteristics. In this study, we demonstrate that patient-derived glioblastoma samples from within the SVZ region show increased (epithelial-)mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis/hypoxia signaling as compared to glioblastoma samples from the same patient from outside the SVZ. These results suggest that intratumoral alterations in oncogenic signaling could be mediated by the SVZ microenvironment. Our findings offer rationale for specific targeting of the SVZ in the development of glioblastoma therapy. Background: Involvement of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in glioblastoma is associated with poor prognosis and is associated with specific tumor-biological characteristics. The SVZ microenvironment can influence gene expression in glioblastoma cells in preclinical models. We aimed to investigate whether the SVZ microenvironment has any influence on intratumoral gene expression patterns in glioblastoma patients. Methods: The publicly available Ivy Glioblastoma database contains clinical, radiological and whole exome sequencing data from multiple regions from resected glioblastomas. SVZ involvement of the various tissue samples was evaluated on MRI scans. In tumors that contacted the SVZ, we performed gene expression analyses and gene set enrichment analyses to compare gene (set) expression in tumor regions within the SVZ to tumor regions outside the SVZ. We also compared these samples to glioblastomas that did not contact the SVZ. Results: Within glioblastomas that contacted the SVZ, tissue samples within the SVZ showed enrichment of gene sets involved in (epithelial-)mesenchymal transition, NF-kappa B and STAT3 signaling, angiogenesis and hypoxia, compared to the samples outside of the SVZ region from the same tumors (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.25). Comparison of glioblastoma samples within the SVZ region to samples from tumors that did not contact the SVZ yielded similar results. In contrast, we observed no differences when comparing the samples outside of the SVZ from SVZ-contacting glioblastomas with samples from glioblastomas that did not contact the SVZ at all. Conclusion: Glioblastoma samples in the SVZ region are enriched for increased (epithelial-)mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis/hypoxia signaling, possibly mediated by the SVZ microenvironment.

Acquisition of a hybrid E/M state is essential for tumorigenicity of basal breast cancer cells	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Carcinoma cells residing in an intermediate phenotypic state along the epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) spectrum are associated with malignant phenotypes, such as invasiveness, tumor-initiating ability, and metastatic dissemination. Using the recently described CD104(+)/CD44(hi) antigen marker combination, we isolated highly tumorigenic breast cancer cells residing stably-both in vitro and in vivo-in an intermediate phenotypic state and coexpressing both epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) markers. We demonstrate that tumorigenicity depends on individual cells residing in this E/M hybrid state and cannot be phenocopied by mixing two cell populations that reside stably at the two ends of the spectrum, i.e., in the E and in the M state. Hence, residence in a specific intermediate state along the E-M spectrum rather than phenotypic plasticity appears critical to the expression of tumor-initiating capacity. Acquisition of this E/M hybrid state is facilitated by the differential expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) and is accompanied by the expression of adult stem cell programs, notably, active canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, transition from the highly tumorigenic E/M state to a fully mesenchymal phenotype, achieved by constitutive ectopic expression of Zeb1, is sufficient to drive cells out of the E/M hybrid state into a highly mesenchymal state, which is accompanied by a substantial loss of tumorigenicity and a switch from canonical to noncanonical Wnt signaling. Identifying the gatekeepers of the various phenotypic states arrayed along the E-M spectrum is likely to prove useful in developing therapeutic approaches that operate by shifting cancer cells between distinct states along this spectrum.

Several studies, however, have reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are capable of transdifferentiating to neural cell types, effectively crossing normal lineage restriction boundaries. Such reports have been based on the detection of neural-related proteins by the differentiated MSCs. In order to assess the potential of human adult MSCs to undergo true differentiation to a neural lineage and to determine the degree of homogeneity between donor samples, we have used RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry to investigate the basal expression of a range of neural related mRNAs and proteins in populations of non-differentiated MSCs obtained from 4 donors. Results: The expression analysis revealed that several of the commonly used marker genes from other studies like nestin, Enolase2 and microtubule associated protein 1b (MAP1b) are already expressed by undifferentiated human MSCs. Furthermore, mRNA for some of the neural-related transcription factors, e. g. Engrailed-1 and Nurr1 were also strongly expressed. However, several other neural-related mRNAs (e. g. DRD2, enolase2, NFL and MBP) could be identified, but not in all donor samples. Similarly, synaptic vesicle-related mRNA, STX1A could only be detected in 2 of the 4 undifferentiated donor hMSC samples. More significantly, each donor sample revealed a unique expression pattern, demonstrating a significant variation of marker expression. Conclusion: The present study highlights the existence of an inter-donor variability of expression of neural-related markers in human MSC samples that has not previously been described. This donor-related heterogeneity might influence the reproducibility of transdifferentiation protocols as well as contributing to the ongoing controversy about differentiation capacities of MSCs. Therefore, further studies need to consider the differences between donor samples prior to any treatment as well as the possibility of harvesting donor cells that may be inappropriate for transplantation strategies.

The current neuro-oncology practice has incorporated genes involved in key molecular events that drive GBM tumorigenesis as biomarkers to guide diagnosis and design treatment. This study summarizes findings describing the significant heterogeneity of GBM at the transcriptional and genomic levels, emphasizing 18 driver genes with clinical relevance. A pattern was identified fitting the stem cell model for GBM ontogenesis, with an upregulation profile for MGMT and downregulation for ATRX, H3F3A, TP53 and EGFR in the mesenchymal subtype. We also detected overexpression of EGFR, NES, VIM and TP53 in the classical subtype and of MKi67 and OLIG2 genes in the proneural subtype. Furthermore, we found a combination of the four biomarkers EGFR, NES, OLIG2 and VIM with a remarkable differential expression pattern which confers them a strong potential to determine the GBM molecular subtype. A unique distribution of somatic mutations was found for the young and adult population, particularly for genes related to DNA repair and chromatin remodelling, highlighting ATRX, MGMT and IDH1. Our results also revealed that highly lesioned genes undergo differential regulation with particular biological pathways for young patients. This multi-omic analysis will help delineate future strategies related to the use of these molecular markers for clinical decision-making in the medical routine.																	2042-8898	2042-8901				JUN 11	2021	11	4							20200072	10.1098/rsfs.2020.0072							WOS:000662964700006	34123356

These cells are characterized by morphological, phenotypic, and molecular features distinct from MSCs and we named them Mesodermal Progenitor Cells (MPCs). MPCs are round, with a thick highly refringent core region; they show strong, trypsin resistant adherence to plastic. Failure to expand MPCs directly revealed that they are slow in cycling. This is as also suggested by Ki-67 negativity. On the other hand, culturing MPCs in standard medium designed for MSC expansion, gave rise to a population of exponentially growing MSC-like cells. Besides showing mesenchymal differentiation capacity MPCs retained angiogenic potential, confirming their multiple lineage progenitor nature. Here we describe an optimized highly reproducible protocol to isolate and characterize hBM-MPCs by flow cytometry (CD73, CD90, CD31, and CD45), nestin expression, and F-actin organization. Protocols for mesengenic and angiogenic differentiation of MPCs are also provided. Here we also suggest a more appropriate nomenclature for these cells, which has been re-named as "Mesangiogenic Progenitor Cells".

Although previous studies have demonstrated that certain cell subsets and communications are activated to drive the repair and regeneration of bladder, it is not well understood how distinct bladder cell subsets function synergistically in this process. Here, we used droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the cell types within the murine bladder mucous layer under normal and injured conditions. Our analysis showed that superficial cells are directly repaired by cycling intermediate cells. We further identified two resident mesenchymal lineages (Acta2(+) myofibroblasts and Cd34(+) fibroblasts). The delineation of cell-cell communications revealed that Acta2(+) myofibroblasts upregulated Fgf7 expression during acute injury, which activated Fgfr signaling in progenitor cells within the basal/intermediate layers to promote urothelial cell growth and repair. Overall, our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular dynamics during cyclophosphamide-induced bladder injury and may help identify important niche factors contributing to the regeneration of injured bladders.

Single-cell cancer studies reveal significant genomic and transcriptomic ITH within a tumour and it is no longer adequate to employ single-subtype assignment as this does not acknowledge the ITH that exists. Molecular assessment of subtype heterogeneity (MASH) was developed to comprehensively report on the composition of all transcriptomic subtypes within a tumour lesion. Using MASH on 3431 ovarian cancer samples, correlation and association analyses with survival, metastasis and clinical outcomes were performed to assess the impact of subtype composition as a surrogate for ITH. The association was validated on two independent cohorts. We identified that 30% of ovarian tumours consist of two or more subtypes. When biological features of the subtype constituents were examined, we identified significant impact on clinical outcomes with the presence of poor prognostic subtypes (Mes or Stem-A). Poorer outcomes correlated with having higher degrees of poor prognostic subtype populations within the tumour. Subtype prediction in several independent datasets reflected a similar prognostic trend. In addition, paired analysis of primary and recurrent/metastatic tumours demonstrated Mes and/or Stem-A subtypes predominated in recurrent and metastatic tumours regardless of the original primary subtype.

Development of an Innovative Cell Isolation Method for the Investigation of Breast Cancer Pathogenesis and Angiogenesis for Experimental In Vitro And In Vivo Assays	HANDCHIRURGIE MIKROCHIRURGIE PLASTISCHE CHIRURGIE												Background Breast cancer is the world's most common cancer among women. Autologous lipotransfer is increasingly used for breast reconstruction following surgical removal of the tumour. In cell-assisted lipotransfer, the transplant is enriched with stem cells from adipose tissue (ADSC). Despite positive clinical results, there are some concerns regarding oncological safety due to transplanted stem cells. To date there are only a few breast cancer studies using primary cells from the same patient to enable further investigation into the complexity of cell-cell interactions in breast cancer in an experimental setting. Materials and methods We performed literature research on the topic of autologous lipotransfer. 5 different cell types (epithelial, mesenchymal cells, ADSC, endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells) were isolated from mammary (carcinoma) tissue or blood and were subsequently characterised for gene and protein expression as well as functional properties. The arteriovenous (AV) loop model in the rat was evaluated as a possible in vivo model for breast cancer pathogenesis and angiogenesis in this study. Results The literature provided evidence for an in-vitro interaction between ADSC and cells of the mammary (carcinoma) tissue. In some clinical studies, certain subgroups of patients appeared to be exposed to an increased risk of tumour recurrence after lipotransfer, but in most studies no correlation between lipotransfer and tumour recurrence was found. Different cell populations, which differed significantly in terms of surface markers, gene expression and functional properties, were isolated from tissue of the same patient. Axial vascularised tissue was successfully generated in the AV loop model. Conclusion In this study we were able to isolate different cell populations from the same patient, which reflect the heterogeneity of the tumour tissue. This enables a precise analysis of cell-cell interactions and their effects on tumour angiogenesis and pathogenesis in breast cancer. In combination with the AV loop model, this offers new possibilities to generate vascularised mammary carcinoma tissue as well as healthy mammary gland tissue in vivo as an optimal model for the clinical setting.

Methods: A comparative analysis of cultured hOSSCs derived from four unrelated donors was conducted by multichromatic flow cytometry for six distinct CD antigens, including the CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, CD146, and CD34. Results: The hOSSCs, as well as the reference cells, displayed phenotypical profiles that were similar in high expression of the hallmark mesenchymal stem cell markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, and also the cancer stem cell marker CD166. Notably, there was considerable variation regarding the expression of CD34, where the highest levels were found in the corneal and scleral compartments. The multi-differentiation potential marker CD146 was also expressed highly variably, ranging from 9% to 89%, but the limbal stromal and endometrial mesenchymal stem cells significantly surpassed their counterparts within the ocular and reference groups, respectively. The use of six markers enabled investigation of 64 possible variants, however, just four variants accounted for almost 90% of all hOSSCs, with the co-expression of CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166 and a combination of CD146 and CD34. The limbal compartment appeared unique in that it displayed greatest immunophenotype diversity and harbored the highest proportion of the CD146+CD34-pericyte-like forms, but, interestingly, the pericyte-like cells were also found in the avascular cornea. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that the hOSSCs exhibit an immunophenotype consistent with that of MSCs, further highlight the phenotypical heterogeneity in stroma from distinct ocular surface compartments, and finally underscore the uniqueness of the limbal region.

Richard			Harnessing OLIG2 function in tumorigenicity and plasticity to target malignant gliomas	CELL CYCLE												Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and malignant brain tumor, displaying notorious resistance to conventional therapy, partially due to molecular and genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the mechanisms for gliomagenesis, tumor stem/progenitor cell propagation and phenotypic diversity is critical for devising effective and targeted therapy for this lethal disease. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OLIG2, which is universally expressed in gliomas, has emerged as an important player in GBM cell reprogramming, genotoxic resistance, and tumor phenotype plasticity. In an animal model of proneural GBM, elimination of mitotic OLIG2(+) progenitors blocks tumor growth, suggesting that these progenitors are a seeding source for glioma propagation. OLIG2 deletion reduces tumor growth and causes an oligodendrocytic to astrocytic phenotype shift, with PDGFR downregulation and reciprocal EGFR signaling upregulation, underlying alternative pathways in tumor recurrence. In patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSC), knockdown of OLIG2 leads to downregulation of PDGFR, while OLIG2 silencing results in a shift from proneural-to-classical gene expression pattern or a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition in distinct GSC cell lines, where OLIG2 appears to regulate EGFR expression in a context-dependent manner. In addition, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation by a series of protein kinases regulates OLIG2 activity in glioma cell growth and invasive behaviors. In this perspective, we will review the role of OLIG2 in tumor initiation, proliferation and phenotypic plasticity in animal models of gliomas and human GSC cell lines, and discuss the underlying mechanisms in the control of tumor growth and potential therapeutic strategies to target OLIG2 in malignant gliomas.																	1538-4101	1551-4005					2017	16	18					1654	1660		10.1080/15384101.2017.1361062							WOS:000411086900008	28806136

We previously reported that CD73 activated AKT signaling via the Rap1/P110 beta cascade. Here, we further explored the roles of CD73 in regulating CSC characteristics of HCC. Methods CD73 expression modulations were conducted by lentiviral transfections. CD73+ fractions were purified by magnetic-based sorting, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting was used to assess differentiation potentials. A sphere-forming assay was performed to evaluate CSC traits in vitro, subcutaneous NOD/SCID mice models were generated to assess in vivo CSC features, and colony formation assays assessed drug resistance capacities. Stemness-associated gene expression was also determined, and underlying mechanisms were investigated by evaluating immunoprecipitation and ubiquitylation. Results We found CD73 expression was positively associated with sphere-forming capacity and elevated in HCC spheroids. CD73 knockdown hindered sphere formation, Lenvatinib resistance, and stemness-associated gene expression, while CD73 overexpression achieved the opposite effects. Moreover, CD73 knockdown significantly inhibited the in vivo tumor propagation capacity. Notably, we found that CD73+ cells exhibited substantially stronger CSC traits than their CD73- counterparts. Mechanistically, CD73 exerted its pro-stemness activity through dual AKT-dependent mechanisms: activating SOX9 transcription via c-Myc, and preventing SOX9 degradation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Clinically, the combined analysis of CD73 and SOX9 achieved a more accurate prediction of prognosis. Conclusions Collectively, CD73 plays a critical role in sustaining CSCs traits by upregulating SOX9 expression and enhancing its protein stability. Targeting CD73 might be a promising strategy to eradicate CSCs and reverse Lenvatinib resistance in HCC.

J	Ribeiro, AS; Paredes, J				Ribeiro, Ana Sofia; Paredes, Joana			P-cadherin linking breast cancer stem cells and invasion: a promising marker to identify an "intermediate/metastable" EMT state	FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY												Epithelial mesenchymal transition (also known as EMT) is a fundamental mechanism occurring during embryonic development and tissue differentiation, being also crucial for cancer progression. Actually, the EMT program contributes to the dissemination of cancer cells from solid tumors and to the formation of micro-metastasis that subsequently develop into clinically detectable metastases. Besides being a process that is defined by the progressive loss of epithelial cell characteristics and the acquisition of mesenchymal features, EMT has also been implicated in therapy resistance, immune escape, and maintenance of cancer stem cell properties, such as self-renewal capacity. However, the majority of the studies usually neglect the progressive alterations occurring during intermediate EMT states, which imply a range of phenotypic cellular heterogeneity that can potentially generate more metastable and plastic tumor cells. In fact, few studies have tried to identify these transitory states, partly due to the current lack of a detailed understanding of EMT, as well as of reliable readouts for its progression. Herein, a brief review of evidences is presented, showing that P-cadherin expression, which has been already identified as a breast cancer stem cell marker and invasive promoter, is probably able to identify an intermediate EMT state associated with a metastable phenotype. This hypothesis is based on our own work, as well as on the results described by others, which suggest the use of P-cadherin as a promising EMT marker, clearly functioning as an important clinical prognostic factor and putative therapeutic target in breast carcinogenesis.

J	Li, XJ; Li, CY; Bai, D; Leng, Y				Li, Xiang-Jun; Li, Chun-Yan; Bai, Dan; Leng, Ying			Insights into stem cell therapy for diabetic retinopathy: a bibliometric and visual analysis	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH												Stem cells have been confirmed to be involved in the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used Citespace software to visually analyze 552 articles exploring the stem cell-based treatment of diabetic retinopathy over the past 20 years, which were included in the Web of Science Core Collection. We found the following: (1) a co-citation analysis of the references cited by all 552 articles indicated 15 clusters. In cluster #0, representing the stem cell field, some highly cited landmark studies emerged between 2009-2013. For example, endothelial progenitor cells and diabetic retinopathy gradually received the full attention of scholars, in terms of their relationship and therapeutic prospects. Some researchers also verified the potential of adipose-derived stem cells to differentiate into stable retinal perivascular cells, using a variety of animal models of retinal vascular disease. All of these achievements provided references for the subsequent stem cell research. (2) An analysis of popular keywords among the 552 articles revealed that, during the past 20 years, a relative increase in basic research articles examining stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy was observed. The contents of these articles primarily involved the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular regeneration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. (3) A burst analysis of keywords used in the 552 articles indicated that genetic and cytological research regarding the promotion of angiogenesis was an issue of concern from 2001 to 2012, including several studies addressing the expression of various growth factor genes; from 2014 to 2020, mouse models of diabetic retinopathy were recognized as mature animal models, and the most recent research has focused on macular degeneration, macular edema, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory changes in diabetic animal models. (4) Globally, the current authoritative studies have focused on basic research towards the stem cell treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Existing clinical studies are of low quality and have insufficient evidence levels, and their findings have not yet been widely accepted in clinical practice. Major challenges during stem cell transplantation remain, including stem cell heterogeneity, cell delivery, and the effective homing of stem cells to damaged tissue. However, clinical trials examining potential stem cell-based treatments of diabetic retinopathy, including the use of pluripotent stem cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and endothelial progenitor cells, are currently ongoing, and high-quality clinical evidence is likely to appear in the future, to promote clinical transformation.

Here we show the coexistence of distinct breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) as identified by ALDH(+) and CD29(hi)CD61(+) markers, respectively, in murine models of breast cancer. While both BCSC exhibit enhanced tumor-initiating potential, CD29(hi)CD61(+) BCSC displayed increased invasive abilities and higher expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and mammary stem cell-associated genes, whereas ALDH(+) BCSC were more closely associated with luminal progenitors. Attenuating the autophagy regulator FIP200 diminished the tumor-initiating properties of both ALDH(+) and CD29(hi)CD61(+) BCSC, as achieved by impairing either the Stat3 or TGF beta/Smad pathways, respectively. Furthermore, combining the Stat3 inhibitor Stattic and the Tgf beta-R1 inhibitor LY-2157299 inhibited the formation of both epithelial and mesenchymal BCSC colonies. In vivo, this combination treatment was sufficient to limit tumor growth and reduce BCSC number. Overall, our findings reveal a differential dependence of heterogeneous BCSC populations on divergent signaling pathways, with implications on how to tailor drug combinations to improve therapeutic efficacy.

In this study, a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 was found to suppress the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway and E2F4 interacted with Smad3 to inhibit expression of mesenchymal markers. However, palmitoylation of Smad3 mediated by palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC19 promoted activation of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, and its interaction with EP300 promoted expression of mesenchymal markers in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM. Smad3 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha may be important molecular targets for treatment of glioma because they appear to coordinate the basic aspects of cancer stem cell biology.

Gene expression profiles were mainly influenced by the level of cell confluence rather than initial seeding density. The analysis showed that 276 genes were upregulated and 230 genes downregulated in MSCs harvested at similar to 90% versus similar to 50% confluence (P < 0.05, FC > 2). The genes that were highly expressed in MSCs largely corresponded to chemotaxis, inflammation, and immune responses, indicating direct or indirect involvement in immunomodulatory functions. Specifically, PTGES and ULBP1 were up-regulated in MSCs harvested at high density. Treatment of MSCs with PTGES or ULBP1 siRNA reversed their inhibition of T-cell proliferation in vitro. The culture conditions such as cell confluence at harvest seem to be important for gene expression profile of MSCs; therefore, the results of this study may provide useful guidelines for the harvest of MSCs that can appropriately suppress the immune response.																	2314-6133	2314-6141					2013	2013								154919	10.1155/2013/154919							WOS:000320549600001	23862134

A cell-based model preserving the evolving molecular profiles of a tumour during treatment is key to understanding the recurrence mechanisms and development of strategies to overcome resistance. In this study, we established a matched pair of glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) cultures from patient glioblastoma samples before and after epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy. A patient with recurrent glioblastoma (MGG70R) harboring focal, high-level EGFR amplification received the irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib. The tumour that subsequently recurred (MGG70RR) showed diploid EGFR, suggesting inhibitor-mediated elimination of EGFR-amplified tumour cells and propagation of EGFR non-amplified cell subpopulations. The MGG70R-GSC line established from MGG70R formed xenografts retaining EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression, while MGG70RR-GSC established from MGG70RR generated tumours that lacked EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression. MGG70R-GSC-derived intracranial xenografts were more proliferative than MGG70RR-GSC xenografts, which had upregulated mesenchymal markers, mirroring the pathological observation in the corresponding patient tumours. In vitro MGG70R-GSC was more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors than MGG70RR-GSC. Thus, these molecularly distinct GSC lines recapitulated the subpopulation alteration that occurred during glioblastoma evasion of targeted therapy, and offer a valuable model facilitating therapeutic development for recurrent glioblastoma.																	2045-2322					JAN 15	2019	9								139	10.1038/s41598-018-37437-2							WOS:000455593600024	30644426

GM-CSF Mediates Mesenchymal-Epithelial Cross-talk in Pancreatic Cancer	CANCER DISCOVERY												Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by a dense stroma consisting of a prevalence of activated fibroblasts whose functional contributions to pancreatic tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. In this study, we provide the first identification and characterization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) within the human PDA microenvironment, highlighting the heterogeneity of the fibroblast population. Primary patient PDA samples and low-passage human pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblast cultures were found to contain a unique population of cancer-associated MSCs (CA-MSC). CA-MSCs markedly enhanced the growth, invasion, and metastatic potential of PDA cancer cells. CA-MSCs secreted the cytokine GM-CSF that was required for tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and transendothelial migration. Depletion of GM-CSF in CA-MSCs inhibited the ability of these cells to promote tumor cell growth and metastasis. Together, these data identify a population of MSCs within the tumor microenvironment that possesses a unique ability, through GM-CSF signaling, to promote PDA survival and metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: The role of stroma in pancreatic cancer is controversial. Here, we provide the first characterization of MSCs within the human PDA microenvironment and demonstrate that CA-MSCs promote tumorigenesis through the production of GM-CSF. These data identify a novel cytokine pathway that mediates mesenchymal-epithelial cross-talk and is amenable to therapeutic intervention. Cancer Discov; 6( 8); 886-99. (C) 2016 AACR.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the extent of cell variety in single-cell-derived clones and propose a different strategy in treating cancer by observed phenotypic heterogeneity in cellular types. Additionally, the role of metabolic enzyme and housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), in cellular phenotype was evaluated in two breast cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: Two GAPDH-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, MCF7-GAPDH-RFP (MCF7-RFP) and MDA-MB-231-GAPDH-RFP (MDA-RFP), were established. Microscopic recordings were made at 12-h intervals in single-cell-derived clones of both cell lines up to 8-10 days. Crystal violet and Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst), as well as specific cell-type (epithelial and mesenchymal) antibodies, were used for cytochemical and immunohistochemical staining analyses, respectively, at 3, 6 and 9 days during cell growth. Results: Three types of clones with distinct morphologies were identified as holo-, mero-and paraclones. The rates of colony survival during cell growth were 8.3 and 41.7% in MCF7-RFP and MDA-RFP, respectively. Although no significant difference was found in the colony forming efficiency (CFE) of both MCF7 and MDAMD- 231 wild-type cells, a markedly significant difference was seen in the CFE of MCF7-RFP and MDA-RFP cells (p=0.001). Wild-type cell-derived holoclones of both cell lines showed drug resistance to doxorubicin (Dox). However, levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and vimentin (VIM) marginally decreased in Dox-treated clones. Furthermore, high level of intraclonal heterogeneity was found for CD44, CD140a, VIM, fibronectin (FN), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin (PXN) and vinculin (VCL) in MCF7 and MDA clones during different stages of clonal development. Expressions of CD140a, FN, VIM and FAK were induced in GAPDH-red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged clones of both cell lines. Conclusion: The GAPDH-RFP recombinant protein played an important role in morphological heterogeneity detection in early stages of clonal development. Moreover, phenotypic heterogeneity in clones, caused by the cells expressing specific antigens, such as CD44, CD140a, FN, VIM, FAK and VCL, can be the right target for therapeutic drugs.																	0250-7005	1791-7530				MAY	2017	37	5					2343	2354		10.21873/anticanres.11572							WOS:000402173300022	28476800

In this study, we examined the role of these senescence-associated microRNAs for cellular aging and differentiation of MSC. Proliferation was reduced upon transfection with miR-369-5p, miR-371, and miR-499. Adipogenic differentiation was impaired by miR-369-5p whereas it was highly increased by miR-371. This was accompanied by respective gene expression changes of some adipogenic key molecules (adiponectin and fatty acid-binding protein 4 [FABP4]). Furthermore luciferase reporter assay indicated that FABP4 is a direct target of miR-369-5p. Microarray analysis upon adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation revealed down-regulation of several microRNAs albeit miR-369-5p and miR-371 were not affected. Expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B was up-regulated by transfection of miR-371 whereas expression of DNMT3A was down-regulated by miR-369-5p. In summary, we identified miR-369-5p and miR-371 as antagonistic up-stream regulators of adipogenic differentiation and this might be indirectly mediated by epigenetic modifications. J. Cell.

J	Aquino, JB; Sierra, R; Montaldo, LA				Aquino, Jorge B.; Sierra, Romina; Montaldo, Laura A.			Diverse cellular origins of adult blood vascular endothelial cells	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												During embryonic stages, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) originate from the mesoderm, at specific extraembryonic and embryonic regions, through a process called vasculogenesis. In the adult, EC renewal/replacement mostly depend on local resident ECs or endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Nevertheless, contribution from circulating ECs/EPCs was also reported. In addition, cells lacking from EC/EPC markers with in vitro extended plasticity were shown to originate endothelial-like cells (ELCs). Most of these cells consist of mesenchymal stromal progenitors, which would eventually get mobilized from the bone marrow after injury. Based on that, current knowledge on different mouse and human bone marrow stromal cell (BM-SC) subpopulations, able to contribute with mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), is herein reviewed. Such analyses underline an unexpected heterogeneity among sinusoidal LepR(+) stromal/CAR cells. For instance, in a recent report a subgroup of LepR(+) stromal/CAR progenitors, which express GLAST and is traced in Wnt1(Cre);R26R(Tom) mice, was found to contribute with ELCs in vivo. These GLAST (+) Wnt1(+) BM-SCs were shown to get mobilized to the peripheral blood and to contribute with liver regeneration. Other sources of ELCs, such as adipose, neural and dental pulp tissues, were also published. Finally, mechanisms likely involved in the enhanced cellular plasticity properties of bone marrow/adipose tissue stromal cells, able to originate ELCs, are assessed. In the future, strategies to analyze the in vivo expression profile of stromal cells, with MSC properties, in combination with screening of active genomic regions at the single cell-level, during early postnatal development and/or after injury, will likely help understanding properties of these ELC sources.

Given MSC plasticity (its potential to mature into alternative lineages), nondestructive monitoring is critical for the optimization of chondrogenic differentiation conditions and the evaluation of the final product. However, conventional validation/assessments of the differentiation process (i.e., quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR] and histology) are end-point assays requiring disruption of the sample. This report introduces molecular beacon (MB)-based nanosensors to achieve noninvasive monitoring of chondrogenic differentiation. These nanosensors consist of biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) encapsulating MBs to detect Type II Collagen (Col2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs that serve as lineage-specific and housekeeping biomarkers, respectively. The sustainable release of MBs from MB-NPs allows longitudinal monitoring of MSCs undergoing chondrogenic differentiation over a period of 28 days. Dual-colored MB loading ensures accurate assessment of Colt mRNA expression level, where potential heterogeneity in nanosensor uptake and retention by MSCs are taken into account. When normalized nanosensor signal was compared against qRT-PCR result, a tight correlation was observed (R-2 = 0.9301). Finally, nanosensor usage was compatible with MSC potency with minimal influence on chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic differentiation.

Researchers have opted for least invasive and broadly multipotent cells with minimum ethical concerns. Bovine amniotic fluid derived mesenchymal stem cells (BAF-MSCs) due to their ease of collection and owing similar gestational length to that of human could be presumed as an attractive large animal model for biomedical and biotechnology research. Methods: Bovine amniotic fluid derived stem cells were isolated from abattoir based samples and characterized for epithelial, neuronal, mesenchymal and pluripotent markers by qPCR and immunofluorescence studies at P1, P3, P5 and P7 alongside population doubling time, growth curve and multilineage differentiation studies. Results: The cells were explored for unique expression of Sox2, which was observed to be up regulated with increase in passage number and Nestin was found to be downregulated during further passaging of mesenchymal cells in this study. The cells also co-expressed Oct 3/4 at initial passages which diminished within further passages. Evidence regarding diversity and heterogeneity in different cell population in amniotic fluid was recorded by positive expression of epithelial cell markers like pan Cytokeratin and p63 during early passages. The study suggested that cells with higher expression of Sox2 generated comparatively larger neurospheres with comparative strong expression of Sox2 and Nestin by immunofluorescence staining and qPCR analysis. Besides BAF-MSCs derived neurospheres were also shown to express pro-neuronal markers like beta-III Tubulin, GAP43 and ASCL-1. Conclusions: This study explores and characterizes BAF-MSCs for their multipotent and neurogenic potentials and their use for clinical applications, though more detailed studies are needed to determine the exact pathways linked with neurogenic capacities of these cells and their morphological assessments at different gestational ages in bovines. The knowledge from the bovine model after detailed studies, proven safety and efficacy could also be used to understand substitutive strategies to investigate MSCs physiology at different trimesters and potential application of these cells for human and veterinary regenerative medicine provided the animal ethics are carefully monitored.

Organ reconstruction: Dream or reality for the future	BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING					6th China-France International Symposium on Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine / 1st Meeting of the France-China International CNRS Network (GDRI)	JUL 10-13, 2016	Nancy, FRANCE	France China Int CNRS Network, CeSMeR				The relevance of research on reconstructed organs is justified by the lack of organs available for transplant and the growing needs for the ageing population. The development of a reconstructed organ involves two parallel complementary steps: de-cellularization of the organ with the need to maintain the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and vascular network and re-cellularization of the scaffold with stem cells or resident cells. Whole organ engineering for liver, heart, lung or kidneys, is particularly difficult because of the structural complexity of organs and heterogeneity of cells. Rodent, porcine and rhesus monkey organs have been de-cellularized to obtain a scaffold with preserved extracellular matrix and vascular network. As concern the cells for re-cellularization, embryonic, foetal, adult, progenitor stem cells and also iPS have been proposed. Heart construction could be an alternative option for the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. It is based on the use of an extracellular matrix coming from an animal's heart and seeded with cells likely to reconstruct a normal cardiac function. Though de-cellularization techniques now seem controlled, the issues posed by the selection of cells capable of generating the various components of cardiac tissue are not settled yet. In addition, the recolonisation of the matrix does not only depend on the phenotype of cells that are used, but it is also impacted by the nature of biochemical signals emitted. Recent researches have shown that it is possible to use decellularized whole liver treated by detergents as scaffold, which keeps the entire network of blood vessels and the integrated extracellular matrix (ECM). Beside of decellularized whole organ scaffold seeding cells selected to repopulate a decellularized liver scaffold are critical for the function of the bioengineered liver. At present, potential cell sources are hepatocyte, and mesenchymal stem cells. Pulmonary regeneration using engineering approaches is complex. In fact, several types of local progenitor cells that contribute to cell repair have been described at different levels of the respiratory tract. Moving towards the alveoles, one finds bronchioalveolar stem cells as well as epithelial cells and pneumocytes. A promising option to increase the donor organ pool is to use allogeneic or xenogeneic decellularized lungs as a scaffold to engineer functional lung tissue ex vivo. The kidney is certainly one of the most difficult organs to reconstruct due to its complex nature and the heterogeneous nature of the cells. There is relatively little research on auto-construction, and experiments have been performed on rats, pigs and monkeys. Nevertheless, before these therapeutic approaches can be applied in clinical practice, many researches are necessary to understand and in particular the behaviour of cells on the decellularized organs as well as the mechanisms of their interaction with the microenvironment. Current knowledges allow optimism for the future but definitive answers can only be given after long term animal studies and controlled clinical studies.																	0959-2989	1878-3619					2017	28			1			S121	S127		10.3233/BME-171633							WOS:000416685800016	28372287

Assembly of Tissue-Engineered Blood Vessels with Spatially Controlled Heterogeneities	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Tissue-engineered human blood vessels may enable in vitro disease modeling and drug screening to accelerate advances in vascular medicine. Existing methods for tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV) fabrication create homogenous tubes not conducive to modeling the focal pathologies characteristic of certain vascular diseases. We developed a system for generating self-assembled human smooth muscle cell (SMC) ring units, which were fused together into TEBVs. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of modular assembly and fusion of ring building units to fabricate spatially controlled, heterogeneous tissue tubes. We first aimed to enhance fusion and reduce total culture time, and determined that reducing ring preculture duration improved tube fusion. Next, we incorporated electrospun polymer ring units onto tube ends as reinforced extensions, which allowed us to cannulate tubes after only 7 days of fusion, and culture tubes with luminal flow in a custom bioreactor. To create focal heterogeneities, we incorporated gelatin microspheres into select ring units during self-assembly, and fused these rings between ring units without microspheres. Cells within rings maintained their spatial position along tissue tubes after fusion. Because tubes fabricated from primary SMCs did not express contractile proteins, we also fabricated tubes from human mesenchymal stem cells, which expressed smooth muscle alpha actin and SM22-. This work describes a platform approach for creating modular TEBVs with spatially defined structural heterogeneities, which may ultimately be applied to mimic focal diseases such as intimal hyperplasia or aneurysm.

Clinical Evolution of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Human Carcinomas	CANCER RESEARCH												The significance of the phenotypic plasticity afforded by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for cancer progression and drug resistance remains to be fully elucidated in the clinic. We evaluated epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic characteristics across a range of tumor histologies using a validated, high-resolution digital microscopic immunofluorescence assay (IFA) that incorporates beta-catenin detection and cellular morphology to delineate carcinoma cells from stromal fibroblasts and that quantitates the individual and colocalized expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (E) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin (V) at subcellular resolution ("EMT-IFA"). We report the discovery of beta-catenin(+) cancer cells that coexpress E-cadherin and vimentin in core-needle biopsies from patients with various advanced metastatic carcinomas, wherein these cells are transitioning between strongly epithelial and strongly mesenchymal-like phenotypes. Treatment of carcinoma models with anticancer drugs that differ in their mechanism of action (the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib in MKN45 gastric carcinoma xenografts and the combination of tubulin-targeting agent paclitaxel with the BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer xenografts) caused changes in the tumor epithelial-mesenchymal character. Moreover, the appearance of partial EMT or mesenchymal-like carcinoma cells in MDA-MB-468 tumors treated with the paclitaxel-nilotinib combination resulted in upregulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and susceptibility to FAK inhibitor. A metastatic prostate cancer patient treated with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib exhibited similar CSC marker upregulation. Therefore, the phenotypic plasticity conferred on carcinoma cells by EMT allows for rapid adaptation to cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapy and could create a form of acquired drug resistance that is transient in nature. Significance: Despite the role of EMT in metastasis and drug resistance, no standardized assessment of EMT phenotypic heterogeneity in human carcinomas exists; the EMT-IFA allows for clinical monitoring of tumor adaptation to therapy.

Single Tumor Cells With Epithelial-Like Morphology Are Associated With Breast Cancer Metastasis	FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY												Introduction: The identification of tumor cells that can be potential metastatic seeds would reach two key aims-prognosis of metastasis risk and appointment of the optimal adjuvant therapy to prevent metastatic disease. Single tumor cells (STCs) located out of multicellular structures can most likely demonstrate features that are needed to initiate metastasis. Methods: One-hundred-and-thirty-five patients with invasive breast carcinoma of no special type have been enrolled. Molecular subtypes of breast cancer were categorized according to St. Gallen recommendations. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to identify STCs with epithelial-like morphology (eSTCs) in breast tumors. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to evaluate stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in STCs. The correlation between STCs and recurrence and metastasis-free survival (MFS) was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Results: Distant metastasis was more frequent in eSTC-positive than eSTC-negative patients (28.0% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.007). When tumor types were analyzed separately, distant metastasis tended to be more frequent in eSTC-positive than eSTC-negative patients for HER2-positive cancer [75.0% (3/4) vs. 12.5% (1/8), p = 0.066]. In luminal A [22.7% (5/22) vs. 10.0% (3/30), p = 0.259], luminal B [21.1% (4/19) vs. 6.7% (2/30), p = 0.189], and triple-negative [40.0% (2/5) vs. 11.8% (2/17), p = 0.209] cancers, distance metastasis was not associated with eSTCs. Median MFS was not reached in eSTC-positive and eSTC-negative patients. eSTC-positive patients had a higher risk of breast cancer metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) 3.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46-8.71; p = 0.001]. When tumor types were analyzed separately, a higher risk of breast cancer metastasis occurred only in HER2-positive patients (HR 8.49, 95% CI: 1.29-55.59; p = 0.016). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed mesenchymal-like STCs (mSTCs) and inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in STCs. There were breast tumors with either eSTCs or mSTCs and tumors with both types of STCs. Both eSTCs and mSTCs were represented by cells with different stem and/or EMT phenotypes. Conclusions: STCs with epithelial-like morphology contribute to breast cancer metastasis and represent an attractive model for studying mechanisms of metastatic seeding. The assessment of STCs in histological sections of breast tumors can be a simple and effective method for the prediction of metastasis risk.

The relationship between PTC and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is also in doubt. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the transcriptome landscape of PTC from eight PTC patients, of which three were concurrent with HT. Predicted copy number variation in epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells revealed the distinct molecular signatures of carcinoma cells. Carcinoma cells demonstrated intertumoral heterogeneity based on BRAF V600E mutation or lymph node metastasis, and some altered genes were identified to be correlated with disease-free survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In addition, transcription factor regulons of follicular epithelial cells unveil the different transcription activation state in PTC patients with or without concurrent HT. The immune cells in tumors exhibited distinct transcriptional states, and the presence of tumor-infiltrating B lymphocytes was predominantly linked to concurrent HT origin. Trajectory analysis of B cells and plasma cells suggested their migration potential from HT adjacent tissues to tumor tissues. Furthermore, we revealed diverse ligand-receptor pairs between non-immune cells, infiltrating myeloid cells, and lymphocytes. Our results provided a single-cell landscape of human PTC. These data would deepen the understanding of PTC, as well as the immunological link between PTC and HT.																	2296-634X					NOV 5	2021	9								758339	10.3389/fcell.2021.758339							WOS:000720445700001	34805166

Here, we demonstrate how the combined use of third-harmonic generation (THG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) imaging can provide direct quantitative biomarkers of adipogenic stem cell differentiation and metabolic state, respectively. Specifically, we imaged over nine weeks silk scaffolds embedded with human mesenchymal stem cells and exposed to either propagation (PM) or adipogenic differentiation media (AM). THG was employed to visualize the formation of lipid droplets. 2PEF was used to assess the metabolic state of the cells through the redox ratio defined based on the endogenous FAD and NADH fluorescence. The redox ratio of cells in the AM scaffold was significantly lower than that in the PM scaffold during week 5 and 9, and correlated with significant increases in lipid-to-cell volume ratio, and number and size of lipid droplets in the AM scaffold. These findings indicate that the decrease in redox ratio during adipogenic differentiation is associated with fatty acid synthesis and lipid accumulation. Our methods therefore enabled us to identify and measure dynamic correlations between lipid droplet formation and cell metabolic state, while providing insight on the spatial heterogeneity of the observed signals.

Human Placenta-Derived CD146-Positive Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Display a Distinct Osteogenic Differentiation Potential	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be differentiated in vitro into a variety of cell types, including adipocytes or osteoblasts. Our recent studies indicated that a high expression of CD146 on MSCs from bone marrow correlates with their robust osteogenic differentiation potential. We therefore investigated if expression of CD146 on MSCs from the placenta correlates with a similar osteogenic differentiation potential. The MSCs were isolated specifically from the endometrial and fetal parts of human term placenta and expanded in separate cultures and compared with MSCs from bone marrow as controls. The expression of cell surface antigens was investigated by flow cytometry. Differentiation of MSCs was documented by cytochemistry and analysis of typical lineage marker genes. CD146-positive MSCs were separated from CD146-negative cells by magnet-assisted cell sorts (MACS). We report that the expression of CD146 is associated with a higher osteogenic differentiation potential in human placenta-derived MSCs (pMSCs) and the CD146(pos) pMSCs generated a mineralized extracellular matrix, whereas the CD146(neg) pMSCs failed to do so. In contrast, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of pMSCs was not different in CD146(pos) compared with CD146(neg) pMSCs. Upon enrichment of pMSCs by MACS, the CD146(neg) and CD146(pos) populations maintained their expression levels for this antigen for several passages in vitro. We conclude that CD146(pos) pMSCs either respond to osteogenic stimuli more vividly or, alternatively, CD146(pos) pMSCs present a pMSC subset that is predetermined to differentiate into osteoblasts.

Extra-embryonic tissues are promising sources of pluripotent stem cells. Among these, human second-trimester amniotic fluid (AF) contains cell populations exhibiting self-renewal capacity, multipotency and the expression of embryonic cell markers. Methods: Here we report the properties of the easily available third-trimester AF cells (AFCs). Different cell types from 6 of 9 AF samples were separated, expanded, and characterized by assessing their morphological, proliferative, and differentiative properties. Results: All isolated cultures presented CD105, CD90 and CD73 mesenchymal markers, whereas they differed among themselves in CD117, CD146, CD31, NG2 and CD133 expression. Their doubling time and telomere length were conserved throughout many passages. Importantly, immunofluorescence and Real-time PCR showed that, during their proliferative state and differentiation, several cultures expressed neuronal and glial markers such as nestin, GFAP, beta-tubulin III and neurofilament H indicating their potential attitude towards a neural fate. Indeed, these cells showed a rather poor capacity to differentiate in adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. Conclusions: In this work we report that cells with neural differentiation capability can be isolated from third-trimester AF, such properties could be useful for neuro-regenerative purposes.				marconi, anna maria/O-2580-2017; Adami, Raffaella/I-8725-2018; Bottai, Daniele/O-2586-2017	marconi, anna maria/0000-0001-6295-1854; Bottai, Daniele/0000-0002-7951-9512; Abrignani, Sergio/0000-0002-0794-3285; Di Giulio, Anna Maria/0000-0002-5702-4623; Adami, Raffaella/0000-0001-9656-3219												0922-6028	1878-3627					2012	30	1					55	68		10.3233/RNN-2011-0620							WOS:000300955300005	22377907

Genomic and expression profiling reveal molecular heterogeneity of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow of early breast cancer	NPJ BREAST CANCER												Detection of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow is an established negative prognostic factor. We isolated small pools of (similar to 20) EPCAM-positive DTCs from early breast cancer patients for genomic profiling. Genome-wide copy number profiles of DTC pools (n = 45) appeared less aberrant than the corresponding primary tumors (PT, n = 16). PIK3CA mutations were detected in 26% of DTC pools (n = 53), none of them were shared with matched PTs. Expression profiling of DTC pools (n = 30) confirmed the upregulation of EPCAM expression and certain oncogenes (e.g., MYC and CCNE1), as well as the absence of hematopoietic features. Two expression subtypes were observed: (1) luminal with dual epithelial-mesenchymal properties (high ESR1 and VIM/CAV1 expression), and (2) basal-like with proliferative/stem cell-like phenotype (low ESR1 and high MKI67/ALDH1A1 expression). We observed high discordance between ESR1 (40%) and ERRB2 (43%) expression in DTC pools vs. the clinical ER and HER2 status of the corresponding primary tumors, suggesting plasticity of biomarker status during dissemination to the bone marrow. Comparison of expression profiles of DTC pools with available data from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of metastatic breast cancer patients revealed gene expression signatures in DTCs that were unique from those of CTCs. For example, ALDH1A1, CAV1, and VIM were upregulated in DTC pools relative to CTCs. Taken together, analysis of pooled DTCs revealed molecular heterogeneity, possible genetic divergence from corresponding primary tumor, and two distinct subpopulations. Validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm the presence of these molecular subtypes and to evaluate their biological and clinical significance.

Thus, investigating the transcriptional profiles of CTCs might help to identify therapy resistant tumor cells and to overcome treatment failure. For this purpose, we established a multi-marker panel for the molecular characterization of single CTCs, detecting epithelial (EpCAM, Muc-1, CK5/7), EMT (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snai1/2, CD117, CD146, CD49f) and stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, SOX2, Notch1/4, Oct4, Lin28) associated transcripts. First primer specificity and PCR-performance of the multiplex-RT-PCRs were successfully validated on genomic DNA and cDNA isolated from OvCar3 cells. The assay sensitivity of the epithelial panel was evaluated by adding defined numbers of tumor cells into the blood of healthy donors and performing a subsequent immunomagnetic tumor cell enrichment (AdnaTest OvarianCancerSelect), resulting in a 100% concordance for the epithelial markers EpCAM and Muc-1 to the AdnaTest OvarianCancerDetect. Additionally, by processing blood from ovarian cancer patients, high assay sensitivity could be verified. In blood of healthy donors no signals for epithelial markers were detected, for EMT and stem cell markers, however, signals were obtained mainly originating from leukocytes which calls for single cell analysis. To that aim by using the ovarian cancer cell line OvCar3, we successfully established a workflow enabling the characterization of single CTCs. It consists of a density gradient dependent enrichment for nucleated cells, a depletion of CD45-positive cells of hematopoietic origin followed by immunofluorescent labeling of CTCs by EpCAM and Muc-1. Single CTCs are then isolated by micromanipulation and processed for panel gene expression profiling. Finally, fifteen single CTCs from three ovarian cancer patients were analyzed and found to be positive for stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, Oct4) and EMT markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, CD117, CD146). Albeit, inter-cellular and intra/inter-patient heterogeneity and co-expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and stem cell transcripts on the same CTC was observed. We have established a robust workflow to perform sensitive single cell panel gene expression analysis without the need of pre-amplification steps. Our data point towards a heterogeneous expression of stem cell and EMT associated transcripts in ovarian cancer CTCs. (C) 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A Cancer Stem Cell Model for Studying Brain Metastases From Primary Lung Cancer	JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE												Brain metastases are most common in adults with lung cancer, predicting uniformly poor patient outcome, with a median survival of only months. Despite their frequency and severity, very little is known about tumorigenesis in brain metastases. We applied previously developed primary solid tumor-initiating cell models to the study of brain metastases from the lung to evaluate the presence of a cancer stem cell population. Patient-derived brain metastases (n 20) and the NCI-H1915 cell line were cultured as stem-enriching tumorspheres. We used in vitro limiting-dilution and sphere-forming assays, as well as intracranial humanmouse xenograft models. To determine genes overexpressed in brain metastasis tumorspheres, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis. All statistical analyses were two-sided. Patient-derived brain metastasis tumorspheres had a mean sphere-forming capacity of 33 spheres/2000 cells (SD 33.40) and median stem-cell frequency of 1/60 (range 01/141), comparable to that of primary brain tumorspheres (P .53 and P .20, respectively). Brain metastases also expressed CD15 and CD133, markers suggestive of a stemlike population. Through intracranial xenotransplantation, brain metastasis tumorspheres were found to recapitulate the original patient tumor heterogeneity. We also identified several genes overexpressed in brain metastasis tumorspheres as statistically significant predictors of poor survival in primary lung cancer. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of a stemlike population in brain metastases from the lung. We also show that NCI-H1915 tumorspheres could be useful in studying self-renewal and tumor initiation in brain metastases. Our candidate genes may be essential to metastatic stem cell populations, where pathway interference may be able to transform a uniformly fatal disease into a more localized and treatable one.

However, the patterns of expression of the chemokine receptors responsible for directing thymic colonization by the earliest thymic migrants remain unknown. We have identified heterogeneity within the earliest thymus seeding cells based on chemokine receptor expression. By analyzing the first wave of progenitors to colonize the thymus at E12 of gestation, we show that multiple chemokine receptors are expressed by T-lymphoid precursors present within perithymic mesenchyme, while expression of chemokine ligands is limited to CCL21, CCL25 and CXCL12, which are located in distinct epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the thymic/parathyroid anlagen. Collectively, these results identify multiple populations of T-lymphoid precursors colonizing the fetal thymus and provide evidence for several potential pathways mediating migration of precursors into the embryonic thymus.

However, we previously reported that TECs differ from normal ECs. Whether the characteristics of TECs derived from different tumors differ remains unknown. To elucidate this, in this study, we isolated two types of TECs from high-metastatic (HM) and low-metastatic (LM) tumors and compared their characteristics. HM tumor-derived TECs (HM-TECs) showed higher proliferative activity and invasive activity than LM tumor-derived TECs (LM-TECs). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of pro-angiogenic genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2, VEGF, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, were higher in HM-TECs than in LM-TECs. The tumor blood vessels themselves and the surrounding area in HM tumors were exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, HM-TECs showed higher mRNA expression levels of the sternness-related gene stem cell antigen and the mesenchymal marker CD90 compared with LM-TECs. HM-TECs were spheroid, with a smoother surface and higher circularity in the stem cell spheroid assay. HM-TECs differentiated into osteogenic cells, expressing activated alkaline phosphatase in an osteogenic medium at a higher rate than either LM-TECs or normal ECs. Furthermore, HM-TECs contained more aneuploid cells than LM-TECs. These results indicate that TECs from HM tumors have a more pro-angiogenic phenotype than those from LM tumors.

There is evidence that EVs specifically released from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are potent cell-free regenerative agents. However, for MSC EVs to be used in therapeutic practices, there must be a standardized and reproducible method for their characterization. The detection and characterization of EVs are a challenge due to their nanoscale size as well as their molecular heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we have fabricated gold nanohole arrays of varying sizes and shapes by electron beam lithography. These platforms have the dual purpose of trapping single EVs and enhancing their vibrational signature in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In this paper, we report SERS spectra for MSC EVs derived from pancreatic tissue (Panc-MSC) and bone marrow (BM-MSC). Using principal component analysis (PCA), we determined that the main compositional differences between these two groups are found at 1236, 761, and 1528 cm(-1), corresponding to amide III, tryptophan, and an in-plane -C=C- vibration, respectively. We additionally explored several machine learning approaches to distinguish between BM- and Panc-MSC EVs and achieved 89 % accuracy, 89 % sensitivity, and 88 % specificity using logistic regression.																	1618-2642	1618-2650				AUG	2021	413	20			SI		5013	5024		10.1007/s00216-021-03464-8		JUN 2021					WOS:000662825200002	34137912

In 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) published minimal guidelines to define MSC identity. Nevertheless, many independent studies demonstrated that cells meeting the ISCT criteria possessed heterogeneous phenotypes and functionalities, heavily influenced by culture conditions. In this study, human MSC derived from many adult (bone marrow and adipose tissue) or fetal (cord blood, Wharton's jelly, umbilical cord perivascular compartment and amniotic fluid) tissues were investigated. Their immunophenotype was analyzed to define consistent source-specific markers by extensive flow cytometry analysis and real-time qRT-PCR. CD271(+) subpopulations were detected in adult MSC, whereas NG2 was significantly more expressed in fetal MSC but failed validation on independent samples coming from an external laboratory. The highest number of CD271(+) adult MSC were detected soon after isolation in serum-based culture conditions. Furthermore, heterogeneous percentages of CD271 expression were found in platelet lysate-based or serum-free culture conditions. Finally, CD271(+) adult MSC showed high clonogenic and osteogenic properties as compared to CD271(+) cells. To conclude, in this phenotype-function correlation study CD271(+) subpopulation confers heterogeneity on adult MSC, confirming the need of more specific markers to address MSC properties.

Proportions of these populations change during tumor evolution, but the occurrence and regulation of glioblastoma subtype transition is not well described. To identify regulators of glioblastoma subtypes we utilized a combination of in vitro experiments and in silico analyses, using experimentally generated as well as publicly available data. Through this combined approach SOX2 was identified to confer a proneural glioblastoma subtype gene expression signature. SFRP2 was subsequently identified as a SOX2-antagonist, able to induce a mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype signature. A subset of patient glioblastoma samples with high SFRP2 and low SOX2 expression was particularly enriched with mesenchymal subtype samples. Phenotypically, SFRP2 decreased tumor sphere formation, stemness as assessed by limiting dilution assay, and overall cell proliferation but increased cell motility, whereas SOX2 induced the opposite effects. Furthermore, an SFRP2/non-canonical-WNT/KLF4/PDGFR/phospho-AKT/SOX2 signaling axis was found to be involved in the mesenchymal transition. Analysis of human tumor tissue spatial gene expression patterns showed distinct expression of SFRP2- and SOX2-correlated genes in vascular and cellular areas, respectively. Finally, conditioned media from SFRP2 overexpressing cells increased CD206 on macrophages. Together, these findings present SFRP2 as a SOX2-antagonist with the capacity to induce a mesenchymal subtype transition in glioma cells located in vascular tumor areas, highlighting its role in glioblastoma tumor evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity.

CD117 is a well-established cancer stem cell marker, but its clinical significance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to identify correlations between CD117 expression and clinical features and outcomes in EOC patients in this meta-analysis. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, and OVID databases to identify eligible studies. Correlations between CD117 expression and clinicopathological parameters and overall survival or diseasefree survival were analyzed. A subgroup analysis was then performed, which was classified by patient ethnicity and age at diagnosis, study sample size, and tumor histological type. Results: A total of seven studies enrolling 1,247 EOC patients were included in this metaanalysis. Our results demonstrated that CD117 expression was significantly correlated with age (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-2.66), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (pooled OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.31-3.02), tumor differentiation grade (pooled OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.48-4.10), and histological type (pooled OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.05-3.26). EOC patients with high CD117 expression had significantly worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.03-1.90) than patients with low CD117 expression. However, no significant correlation was found between CD117 expression and disease-free survival (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.79-2.17). In subgroup analysis, CD117 was identified as a significant prognostic factor for overall survival in European patients (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.13-2.23), younger patients (, 60 years) (HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.10-2.30), studies with sample sizes. 200 (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.32-2.56), and the mixed histological types (HR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.08-2.00). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that CD117 is associated with EOC progression and can serve as a promising prognostic predictor for EOC patients. However, larger scale multicenter clinical trials are still needed to further validate our results.																	1178-6930						2017	10						2951	2961		10.2147/OTT.S136549							WOS:000403224400001	28652777

Therefore, the present study has been performed to investigate how the differentiation of post-harvest, native bone marrow-derived cells is regulated by cyclic stretch in vitro. Bone marrow-derived cells were obtained from mouse femur of both hind limbs and categorized into the following five categories: amebocytes, round cells, spindle cells, stellate cells and others. The cells were seeded on a silicone-made stretch chamber, and subjected to cyclic stretch with an amplitude of 10% at a frequency of 1 Hz for 7 days for cell shape analysis and for 3 days for the analysis of the expression of marker proteins of osteogenic (osteocalcin), vascular smooth muscle (alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain) and neurogenic (neurofilament) differentiation. When disregarding the differences in the cell shapes, there was an overall trend that the application of 10% cyclic stretch inhibited osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation, but enhanced smooth muscle differentiation. Close examinations revealed that round cells were influenced the most by cyclic stretch (significant up-or down-regulation in all the four marker protein expressions) while amebocytes and spindle cells were only influenced by cyclic stretch for vascular smooth muscle and/or neurogenic differentiation.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to systematically assess the outcome of SC therapy trials which report the evolution of each patient before and after cell administration. In this way, we aimed to determine the effect of the SC intervention despite individual heterogeneity in disease progression. We identified 670 references by electronic search and 90 full-text studies were evaluated according to the eligibility criteria. Eleven studies were included comprising 220 cell-treated patients who received mesenchymal (M) SC (n = 152), neural (N) SC (n = 57), or mononuclear cells (MNC: CD34, CD117, and CD133 positive cells) (n = 11). Our analyses indicate that whereas intrathecal injection of mesenchymal stromal cells appears to have a transient positive effect on clinical progression, as measured by the ALS functional rating score, there was a worsening of respiratory function measured by forced vital capacity after all interventions. Based on current evidence, we conclude that optimal cell product and route of administration need to be determined in properly controlled preclinical models before further advancing into ALS patients. In addition, in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms in subsets of patients will help tailoring SC therapy to specific targets and increase the likelihood of improving outcomes.

DNA methylation heterogeneity defines a disease spectrum in Ewing sarcoma	NATURE MEDICINE												Developmental tumors in children and young adults carry few genetic alterations, yet they have diverse clinical presentation. Focusing on Ewing sarcoma, we sought to establish the prevalence and characteristics of epigenetic heterogeneity in genetically homogeneous cancers. We performed genome-scale DNA methylation sequencing for a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma tumors and analyzed epigenetic heterogeneity on three levels: between cancers, between tumors, and within tumors. We observed consistent DNA hypomethylation at enhancers regulated by the disease-defining EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, thus establishing epigenomic enhancer reprogramming as a ubiquitous and characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma. DNA methylation differences between tumors identified a continuous disease spectrum underlying Ewing sarcoma, which reflected the strength of an EWS-FLI1 regulatory signature and a continuum between mesenchymal and stem cell signatures. There was substantial epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors, particularly in patients with metastatic disease. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of epigenetic heterogeneity in Ewing sarcoma and thereby highlights the importance of considering nongenetic aspects of tumor heterogeneity in the context of cancer biology and personalized medicine.

The Phenotypes of Proliferating Glioblastoma Cells Reside on a Single Axis of Variation	CANCER DISCOVERY												Although tumor-propagating cells can be derived from glioblastomas (GBM) of the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, a glioma stem-like cell (GSC) of the classic subtype has not been identified. It is unclear whether mesenchymal GSCs (mGSC) and/or proneural GSCs (pGSC) alone are sufficient to generate the heterogeneity observed in GBM. We performed single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 28 gliomas, and single-cell ATAC sequencing for 8 cases. We found that GBM GSCs reside on a single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. In silico lineage tracing using both transcriptomics and genetics supports mGSCs as the progenitors of pGSCs. Dual inhibition of pGSC-enriched and mGSC-enriched growth and survival pathways provides a more complete treatment than combinations targeting one GSC phenotype alone. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding lineage relationships among GSCs and presents a paradigm by which personalized combination therapies can be derived from single-cell RNA signatures, to overcome intratumor heterogeneity. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor-propagating cells can be derived from mesenchymal and proneural glioblastomas. However, a stem cell of the classic subtype has yet to be demonstrated. We show that classic-subtype gliomas are comprised of proneural and mesenchymal cells. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding lineage relationships between glioma cell types.

Oct-4 is a transcription factor responsible for self-renewal of stem cells, whereas the Notch family of receptors and ligands may play a pivotal role in the regulation of stem cell maintenance and differentiation. This study aimed at an evaluation of Oct-4 and Notch-1 expression in both carcinoma and stromal cells of 83 cases of primary bladder carcinoma and to study the relationship between them. Notch-1 was expressed in carcinoma and stromal cells of all malignant cases, where expression in both cell types was correlated with parameters indicating differentiation, such as low grade (p<0.05) and less proliferation (p<0.05). However, Notch-1 expression in stromal cells was associated with nodal metastasis (p=0.016) and advanced stage (p=0.030). 56.6 and 75.9% of carcinoma and stromal cells of malignant cases showed Oct-4 expression, respectively. Oct-4 expression in carcinoma cells or stromal cells was associated with aggressive features of bladder carcinoma, such as poor differentiation (p=0.001), high proliferation (p<0.001, 0.030), and liability for recurrence (p=0.010, p<0.001). There was an inverse relationship between Notch-1 and Oct-4 expression in carcinoma cells (p=0.002), but stromal expression of Notch-1 was found to be associated with a nuclear pattern of Oct-4 expression in carcinoma cells (p=0.030). Oct-4 as a stem cell marker is expressed in carcinoma cells and in stromal cells of bladder carcinoma, where they may cooperate in the progression of bladder carcinoma by acquiring aggressive features, such as a liability for recurrence and dissemination. Notch-1 is also expressed in both carcinoma cells and stromal cells of bladder carcinoma. Although they could share in enhancing differentiation, stromal expression of Notch-1 may have a bad impact, possibly through up-regulation of the active nuclear form of Oct-4 in carcinoma cells.

Participation of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Muscle Tissue Regeneration	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered as universal regulators of tissue homeostasis. Their use is promising for repair of skeletal muscles after injuries and diseases. The main participants of muscle regeneration are myosatellites, but resident MSCs also play a role in it. In addition, MSCs come from bone marrow to the injured muscle for its reparation. MSCs are capable of myogenic differentiation and fusion with muscle cells. However, paracrine secretion of regulatory molecules by MSCs is more important for regeneration. They promote survival, proliferation and differentiation of cells in the injured muscle. Factors secreted by MSCs affect all stages of reparative process. This allows using MSCs for complex delivery of bioactive molecules. Prospects for the use of MSCs have been demonstrated in various experimental models of muscle damage such as mechanical and chemical injuries, atrophy, ischemia, genetically determined muscular dystrophy. Improving the delivery of MSCs in the muscle can increase the efficiency of regeneration. Cell transplantation on artificial scaffolds allows to achieve this goal. Ultrasound treatment of muscles also concentrates MSCs at the site of injury. Magnetic delivery of the cells is another way to increase their concentration. The paracrine activity of MS Cs can be enhanced by preconditioning them with different stimuli that changes the secretory profile of cells in the desired direction. Genetic modification of MSCs also increases their therapeutic potential. MSCs produce extracellular vesicles with regulatory molecules such as miRNAs. The use of these vesicles and molecules is a new area of regenerative medicine. Activation of MSCs stimulates tissue regeneration due to internal reserves and, therefore, can be considered as a tool of in vivo tissue engineering.

New cell line from adipopancreatic tissue of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												We report the isolation, cultivation, and cryopreservation of cells from adipopancreatic tissue of adult Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. The cell population was cultured for >1 yr and had a mean doubling time of 2 wk. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that >50% of cells contained glial fibrillary acidic protein and pan-cytokeratins. Vigilin, a well-conserved protein related to mRNA transport, was found in only 11% of cells. Alpha smooth-muscle actin and stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 were even less abundant (<5%). Although little is known about tissue homeostasis and regeneration in adult C. harengus, the heterogeneity and long-term proliferation of the cell population described here suggest that it may contain stem cells or progenitor cells. Before the present study, there was only one C. harengus cell line available to researchers. The newly established cell line described in the present study represents an important addition to scientific investigation as well as aquaculture industries and toxicological/virological testing of herring populations.																	1864-7790	1864-7782					2011	11	3					271	278		10.3354/ab00317							WOS:000287668300009

Hypoxia is a common pathologic feature of breast cancer and potentially, at least in part, regulates the initiation, progression, and recurrence of breast cancer. However, less is known about how hypoxia regulates BCSCs. As several well-known microRNAs respond to hypoxia, we aimed to determine how hypoxia regulates the physiological processes of BCSCs by regulating the corresponding microRNAs. As expected, microRNA-137 (miRNA-137 or miR-137) was downregulated upon hypoxic exposure, indicating that it may play critical roles in BCSCs. Introduction of miR-137 mimics promoted cell cycle entry and inhibited hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis as determined by cell cycle assay and apoptosis assay. By detecting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), it was found that miR-137 inhibited ROS accumulation induced by hypoxic exposure and thus suppressed cell apoptosis. Introduction of miR-137 mimics under hypoxia inhibited mitophagy/autophagy by targeting FUN14 domain containing 1 (Fundc1) and thus promoted mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial mass, ATP synthesis and mitochondrial transcriptional activity, which was similar to the effects of Fundc1 knockdown by specific siRNA. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the survival of BCSCs under hypoxia was mediated by miR-137 by regulating mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrated here that the introduction of exogenous miR-137 promoted mitochondrial function, indicating that it may be a potential therapeutic target in BCSCs.																	1021-335X	1791-2431				OCT	2020	44	4					1627	1637		10.3892/or.2020.7714							WOS:000569361800030	32945512					
J	Tyler, M; Tirosh, I				Tyler, Michael; Tirosh, Itay			Decoupling epithelial-mesenchymal transitions from stromal profiles by integrative expression analysis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most commonly cited mechanism for cancer metastasis, but it is difficult to distinguish from profiles of normal stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment. In this study we use published single cell RNA-seq data to directly compare mesenchymal signatures from cancer and stromal cells. Informed by these comparisons, we developed a computational framework to decouple these two sources of mesenchymal expression profiles using bulk RNA-seq datasets. This deconvolution offers the opportunity to characterise EMT across hundreds of tumours and examine its association with metastasis and other clinical features. With this approach, we find three distinct patterns of EMT, associated with squamous, gynaecological and gastrointestinal cancer types. Surprisingly, in most cancer types, EMT patterns are not associated with increased chance of metastasis, suggesting that other steps in the metastatic cascade may represent the main bottleneck. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of EMT profiles and their functional significance across hundreds of tumours while circumventing the confounding effect of stromal cells. Epithelial cancer cells can transition into a mesenchymal phenotype to enable invasion and metastasis. Here, the authors use previously published single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing datasets to decouple the mesenchymal expression profiles of cancer and stromal cells.																	2041-1723					MAY 10	2021	12	1							2592	10.1038/s41467-021-22800-1							WOS:000687305500045	33972543

Radiotherapy-induced plasticity of prostate cancer mobilizes stem-like non-adherent, Erk signaling-dependent cells	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION												Fractionated ionizing radiation combined with surgery or hormone therapy represents the first-choice treatment for medium to high-risk localized prostate carcinoma. One of the main reasons for the failure of radiotherapy in prostate cancer is radioresistance and further dissemination of surviving cells. In this study, exposure of four metastasis-derived human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC-3, LNCaP and 22RV1) to clinically relevant daily fractions of ionizing radiation (35 doses of 2 Gy) resulted in generation of two radiation-surviving populations: adherent senescent-like cells expressing common senescence-associated markers and non-adherent anoikis-resistant stem cell-like cells with active Notch signaling and expression of stem cell markers CD133, Oct-4, Sox2 and Nanog. While a subset of the radiation-surviving adherent cells resumed proliferation shortly after completion of the irradiation regimen, the non-adherent cells started to proliferate only on their reattachment several weeks after the radiation-induced loss of adhesion. Like the parental non-irradiated cells, radiation-surviving re-adherent DU145 cells were tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. The radiation-induced loss of adhesion was dependent on expression of Snail, as siRNA/shRNA-mediated knockdown of Snail prevented cell detachment. On the other hand, survival of the non-adherent cells required active Erk signaling, as chemical inhibition of Erk1/2 by a MEK-selective inhibitor or Erk1/2 knockdown resulted in anoikis-mediated death in the non-adherent cell fraction. Notably, whereas combined inhibition of Erk and PI3K-Akt signaling triggered cell death in the non-adherent cell fraction and blocked proliferation of the adherent population of the prostate cancer cells, such combined treatment had only marginal if any impact on growth of control normal human diploid cells. These results contribute to better understanding of radiation-induced stress response and heterogeneity of human metastatic prostate cancer cells, document treatment-induced plasticity and phenotypically distinct cell subsets, and suggest the way to exploit their differential sensitivity to radiosensitizing drugs in overcoming radioresistance.

At least in part, CAT is likely driven by cancer-specific mechanisms the nature of which is still poorly understood, hampering diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic efforts. It is increasingly appreciated that cancer-specific drivers of CAT include a constellation of oncogenic mutations and their superimposed epigenetic states that shape the transcriptome, phenotype and secretome of cancer cell populations, including the repertoire of genes impacting the vascular and coagulation systems. High-grade brain tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represent a paradigm of locally initiated haemostatic abnormalities that propagate systemically, likely through circulating mediators, such as extracellular vesicles and soluble factors. Reciprocally, CAT impacts the biology of cancer cells and may drive tumour evolution. The constituent, oncogene-transformed cancer cell populations form complex ecosystems, the intricate architecture of which has been recently revealed by single cell sequencing technologies. Amidst this phenotypic heterogeneity, several alternative pathways of CAT may exist both between and within individual tumours and their subtypes, including GBM. Indeed, different contributions of cells expressing key coagulant mediators, such as tissue factor, or podoplanin, have been identified in GBM subtypes driven by oncogenic mutations in EGFR, IDH1 and other transforming genes. Thus, a better understanding of cellular sources of CAT, including dominant cancer cell phenotypes and their dynamic shifts, may help design more personalised approaches to thrombosis in cancer patients to improve outcomes.																	0049-3848	1879-2472				JUL	2020	191			1			S99	S105									WOS:000555314400018	32736787

Qualifying Osteogenic Potency Assay Metrics for Human Multipotent Stromal Cells: TGF-beta 2 a Telling Eligible Biomarker	CELLS												Potency assays are critical for regenerative medicine, addressing the known challenge of functional heterogeneity among human multipotent stromal cells (hMSC). Necessary laboratory cell expansion allows analysis before implantation in the patient. Levels of induction of five signature gene biomarkers, ALPL, COL1A2, DCN, ELN and RUNX2, constituted a previously reported proof-of-principle osteogenic potency assay. We tested assay modification to enhance reproducibility using six consistent bone marrow derived hBM-MSC and explored applicability to three adipose tissue derived hAT-MSC. Using a potent proprietary osteogenic induction factor, the GUSB/YWAHZ reference gene pair provided real time PCR consistency. The novel assay conditions supported the concept that genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins one week after osteogenic induction were informative. Nonetheless, relatively low induction of COL1A2 and ELN encouraged search for additional biomarkers. TGFB2 mRNA induction, important for osteogenic commitment, was readily quantifiable in both hBM-MSC and hAT-MSC. Combined with DCN, TGFB2 mRNA induction data provided discriminatory power for resolving donor-specific heterogeneity. Histomorphometric decorin and TGF-beta 2 protein expression patterns in eight-week heterotopic bone implants also discriminated the two non-bone-forming hMSC. We highlight progress towards prompt osteogenic potency assays, needed by current clinical trials to accelerate improved intervention with enhanced stem cell therapy for serious bone fractures.

Variation in primary and culture-expanded cells derived from connective tissue progenitors in human bone marrow space, bone trabecular surface and adipose tissue	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) embody the heterogeneous stem and progenitor cell populations present in native tissue. CTPs are essential to the formation and remodeling of connective tissue and represent key targets for tissue-engineering and cell-based therapies. To better understand and characterize CTPs, we aimed to compare the (i) concentration and prevalence, (ii) early in vitro biological behavior and (iii) expression of surface-markers and transcription factors among cells derived from marrowspace (MS), trabecular surface (TS), and adipose tissues (AT). Methods. Cancellousbone and subcutaneous-adipose tissues were collected from 8 patients. Cells were isolated and cultured. Colony formation was assayed using Colonyze software based on ASTM standards. Cell concentration ([Cell]), CTP concentration ([CTP]) and CTP prevalence (PCTP) were determined. Attributes of culture-expanded cells were compared based on (i) effective proliferation rate and (ii) expression of surface-markers CD73, CD90, CD105, SSEA-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-1/CD15, Cripto-1, E-Cadherin/CD324, Ep-CAM/CD326, CD146, hyaluronan and transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox-2 and Nanog using flow cytometry. Results. Mean [Cell], [CTP] and P-CTP were significantly different between MS and TS samples (P = 0.03, P = 0.008 and P = 0.0003), respectively. AT-derived cells generated the highest mean total cell yield at day 6 of culture-4-fold greater than TS and more than 40-fold greater than MS per million cells plated. TS colonies grew with higher mean density than MS colonies (290 +/- 11 versus 150 +/- 11 cell per mm(2); P = 0.0002). Expression of classical-mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers was consistently recorded (>95%) from all tissue sources, whereas all the other markers were highly variable. Conclusions. The prevalence and biological potential of CTPs are different between patients and tissue sources and lack variation in classical MSC markers. Other markers are more likely to discriminate differences between cell populations in biological performance. Understanding the underlying reasons for variation in the concentration, prevalence, marker expression and biological potential of CTPs between patients and source tissues and determining the means of managing this variation will contribute to the rational development of cell-based clinical diagnostics and targeted cell-based therapies.

J	Xia, SJ; Pan, Y; Liang, YL; Xu, JJ; Cai, XJ				Xia, Shunjie; Pan, Yu; Liang, Yuelong; Xu, Junjie; Cai, Xiujun			The microenvironmental and metabolic aspects of sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma	EBIOMEDICINE												In most cases, sorafenib-resistant HCC cells exhibit significant mesenchymal phenotype and sternness features. In this context, tumor cells might undergo cell fate transition in response to sorafenib or other targeted drugs in the presence or absence of genetic mutations. Therefore, understanding the major characteristics of drug-resistant cells state helps to discover new treatments that overcome drug resistance. To note, little is known about the metabolic or microenvironmental aspects of the certain tumor cell states beyond the genome. This review mainly focuses on the underlying mechanisms of acquired sorafenib resistance based on CSCs and EMT models, which explain tumor heterogeneity and have been considered the major cause of secondary sorafenib resistance. In particular, it discusses how the tumor microenvironment and tumor metabolism regulate cell sternness, mesenchymal state, and sorafenib resistance through epigenetic regulations, and provides reliable targets that might have synergetic effect with sorafenib.

Aggressive Phenotype of Cells Disseminated via Hematogenous and Lymphatic Route in Breast Cancer Patients	TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY												Intratumoral heterogeneity of breast cancer remains a major challenge in successful treatment. Failure of cancer therapies can also be accredited to inability to systemically eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent evidence points to the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in expanding the pool of tumor cells with CSCs features. Thus, we assessed expression level as well as heterogeneity of CSCs markers in primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-enriched blood fractions in order to correlate them with signs of EMT activation as well as clinicopathological data of breast cancer patients. Level of CSCs markers (ALDH1, CD44, CD133, OCT-4, NANOG) and EMT markers was quantified in PT (N=107), LNM (N=56), and CTCs-enriched blood fractions (N=85). Heterogeneity of CSCs markers expression within each PT and LNM was assessed by calculating Gini Index. Percentage of ALDH1-positive cells was elevated in PT in comparison to LNM (P=.005). However, heterogeneity of the four CSCs markers: ALDH1 (P=.019), CD133 (P=.009), OCT-4 (P=.027), and CD44 (P < .001) was decreased in LNM. Samples classified as mesenchymal (post-EMT) showed elevated expression of CSCs markers (OCT-4 and CD44 in PT; OCT-4 in LNM; ALDH1, OCT-4, NANOG, CD44 in CTCs). Patients with mesenchymal-like CTCs had worse prognosis than patients with epithelial-like or no CTCs (P=.0025). CSCs markers are enriched in PT, LNM, and CTCs with mesenchymal features, but their heterogeneity is decreased in metastatic lymph nodes. Mesenchymal CTCs phenotype correlates with poor prognosis of the patients.

J	Avgustinova, A; Benitah, SA				Avgustinova, Alexandra; Aznar Benitah, Salvador			The epigenetics of tumour initiation: cancer stem cells and their chromatin	CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT												Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in various tumours and are defined by their potential to initiate tumours upon transplantation, self-renew and reconstitute tumour heterogeneity. Modifications of the epigenome can favour tumour initiation by affecting genome integrity, DNA repair and tumour cell plasticity. Importantly, an in-depth understanding of the epigenomic alterations underlying neoplastic transformation may open new avenues for chromatin-targeted cancer treatment, as these epigenetic changes could be inherently more amenable to inhibition and reversal than hardwired genomic alterations. Here we discuss how CSC function is affected by chromatin state and epigenomic instability.

The study aimed also to investigate the feasibility of xenogeneic MSCs implantation. Methods and Results MSC isolated from human hearts were multipotent cells. Separation of MSC with CD105(+)CD34(-) phenotype limited the heterogeneity of the originally isolated cell population. MSC secreted a number of anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines (mainly IL-6, IL-8, and GRO). Human MSC were transplanted into C57Bl/6NCrl mice. Using the mouse model of hindlimb ischemia it was shown that human MSC treated mice demonstrated a higher capillary density 14 days after injury. It was also presented that MSC administrated into the ischemic muscle facilitated fast wound healing (functional recovery by ischemic limb). MSC transplanted into an infarcted myocardium reduced the post-infarction scar, fibrosis, and increased the number of blood vessels both in the border area, and within the post-infarction scar. The improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction was also observed. Conclusion In two murine models (hindlimb ischemia and MI) we did not observe the xenotransplant rejection. Indeed, we have shown that human cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells with CD105(+)CD34(-) phenotype exhibit therapeutic potential. It seems that M2 macrophages are essential for healing and repair of the post-infarcted heart.

Heterogeneous glioblastoma cell cross-talk promotes phenotype alterations and enhanced drug resistance	ONCOTARGET												Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal of brain cancer, and it comprises a heterogeneous mixture of functionally distinct cancer cells that affect tumor progression. We examined the U87, U251, and U373 malignant cell lines as in vitro models to determine the impact of cellular cross-talk on their phenotypic alterations in co-cultures. These cells were also studied at the transcriptome level, to define the mechanisms of their observed mutually affected genomic stability, proliferation, invasion and resistance to temozolomide. This is the first direct demonstration of the neural and mesenchymal molecular fingerprints of U87 and U373 cells, respectively. U87-cell conditioned medium lowered the genomic stability of U373 (U251) cells, without affecting cell proliferation. In contrast, upon exposure of U87 cells to U373 (U251) conditioned medium, U87 cells showed increased genomic stability, decreased proliferation rates and increased invasion, due to a plethora of produced cytokines identified in the co-culture media. This cross talk altered the expression 264 genes in U87 cells that are associated with proliferation, inflammation, migration, and adhesion, and 221 genes in U373 cells that are associated with apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell differentiation and migration. Indirect and direct co-culturing of U87 and U373 cells showed mutually opposite effects on temozolomide resistance. In conclusion, definition of transcriptional alterations of distinct glioblastoma cells upon co-culturing provides better understanding of the mechanisms of glioblastoma heterogeneity, which will provide the basis for more informed glioma treatment in the future.

We performed a meta-analysis to provide an overview of the currently available evidence. Methods Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant controlled studies. A random-effect model was used for pooled analysis of the effect of stem cell based therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Stratified analyses were performed to explore the effect of study characteristics on the outcomes. Results Pooled results from 12 preclinical studies (110 animals in stem cell treatment groups, and 106 animals in control groups) indicated that stem cell based treatment was associated with significantly improved BMD (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.84-1.74, P < 0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (Cochrane's Q test: P = 0.02, I-2 = 45%) among the constituent studies. Implantation of bone marrow cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, and human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells, were all associated with improved BMD as compared to that in the controls (P < 0.05 for all); the only exception being the use of embryonic stem cell transplantation (P > 0.05). Egger's test detected potential publication bias (P = 0.055); however, 'trim and fill' analysis yielded similar results after statistically incorporating the hypothetical studies in the analysis (SMD = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.32-2.16, P < 0.001). Conclusions Stem cell transplantation may improve BMD in animal models of osteoporosis. Our meta-analysis indicates a potential therapeutic role of stem cell based therapy for osteoporosis, and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.																	1932-6203					FEB 16	2016	11	2							e0149400	10.1371/journal.pone.0149400							WOS:000371219000074	26882451

W.; Nam, Do-Hyun			Transcriptional regulatory networks of tumor-associated macrophages that drive malignancy in mesenchymal glioblastoma	GENOME BIOLOGY												Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a complex disease with extensive molecular and transcriptional heterogeneity. GBM can be subcategorized into four distinct subtypes; tumors that shift towards the mesenchymal phenotype upon recurrence are generally associated with treatment resistance, unfavorable prognosis, and the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages. Results: We explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of mesenchymal-associated tumor-associated macrophages (MA-TAMs), which drive the malignant phenotypic state of GBM, and identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as the most highly differentially expressed gene. MARCO(high)TAMs induce a phenotypic shift towards mesenchymal cellular state of glioma stem cells, promoting both invasive and proliferative activities, as well as therapeutic resistance to irradiation. MARCO(high)TAMs also significantly accelerate tumor engraftment and growth in vivo. Moreover, both MA-TAM master regulators and their target genes are significantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes and are often associated with genomic aberrations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin/Akt pathway (PI3K-mTOR-AKT)-related genes. We further demonstrate the origination of MA-TAMs from peripheral blood, as well as their potential association with tumor-induced polarization states and immunosuppressive environments. Conclusions: Collectively, our study characterizes the global transcriptional profile of TAMs driving mesenchymal GBM pathogenesis, providing potential therapeutic targets for improving the effectiveness of GBM immunotherapy.

J	Hillebrands, JL; Klatter, FA; Rozing, J				Hillebrands, JL; Klatter, FA; Rozing, J			Origin of vascular smooth muscle cells and the role of circulating stem cells in transplant arteriosclerosis	ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY												To date, clinical solid-organ transplantation has not achieved its goals as a long-term treatment for patients with end-stage organ failure. Development of so-called chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is now recognized as the predominant cause of allograft loss long term (after the first postoperative year) after transplantation. CTD has the remarkable histological feature that the luminal areas of intragraft arteries become obliterated, predominantly with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) intermingled with some inflammatory cells (transplant arteriosclerosis, or TA). The development of TA is a multifactorial process, and many risk factors have been identified. However, the precise pathogenetic mechanisms leading to TA are largely unknown and, as a result, adequate prevention and treatment protocols are still lacking. This review discusses the origin (donor versus recipient, bone marrow versus nonbone marrow) of the VSMCs in TA lesions. Poorly controlled influx and subsequent proliferative behavior of these VSMCs are considered to be critical elements in the development of TA. Available data show heterogeneity when analyzing the origin of neointimal VSMCs in various transplant models and species, indicating the existence of multiple sites of origin. Based on these findings, a model considering plasticity of VSMC origin in TA in relation to severity and extent of graft damage is proposed.

The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose contains endothelial progenitors, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, pericytes, pre-adipocytes, and stromal/stem cells, among others. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the influence of age and gender in the field of stem cell biology. Yet few studies have evaluated the influence of biological age or sex on either SVF cell heterogeneity or immunophenotype. To address this issue, the current study has compared the flow cytometric characteristics between murine SVF of inguinal (iWAT), epidydimal (eWAT), and brown (BAT) adipose tissue of male and female, as well as young (6-8week) and middle-aged (8-12month) male C57BL/6mice. Murine gender comparisons revealed male iWAT expressed higher percentages of leukocyte and CD34(+) ASC-like sub-populations than female iWAT. Murine age comparisons revealed younger male iWAT, eWAT, and BAT SVF all contained a significantly higher percentage of pre-adipocytes, HSC-like cells, CD25(-), and FoxP3(+) T-regulatory cells compared to SVF from middle-aged male mice. These findings highlight the potential contribution of biological variables on adipose-derived cell applications and experimental outcomes.

The determination of cellular senescence is time consuming and logistically intensive. Here, we propose the use of endogenous autofluorescence as real-time quantification of cellular senescence in human MSC, based on label-free flow cytometry analysis. We correlated cell autofluorescence to senescence using senescence-associated beta-galactosidase assay (SA-beta-Gal) with chromogenic (X-GAL) and fluorescent (C(12)FDG) substrates, gene expression of senescence markers (such as p16(INK4A), p18(INK4C), CCND2 and CDCA7) and telomere length. Autofluorescence was further correlated to MSC differentiation assays (adipogenesis, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis), MSC stemness markers (CD90/CD106) and cytokine secretion (IL-6 and MCP-1). Increased cell autofluorescence significantly correlated with increased SA-beta-Gal signal (both X-GAL and C(12)FDG substrates), cell volume and cell granularity, IL-6/MCP-1 secretion and with increased p16(INK4A) and CCND2 gene expression. Increased cell autofluorescence was negatively associated with the expression of the CD90/CD106 markers, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potentials and p18(INK4C) and CDCA7 gene expression. Cell autofluorescence correlated neither with telomere length nor with adipogenic differentiation potential. We conclude that autofluorescence can be used as fast and non-invasive senescence assay for comparing MSC populations under controlled culture conditions.

Loss of Thy-1 (CD90) antigen expression on mesenchymal stromal cells from hematologic malignancies is induced by in vitro angiogenic stimuli and is associated with peculiar functional and phenotypic characteristics	CYTOTHERAPY												Background Little is known about human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) phenotypic and functional subsets in response to environmental stimuli. The strategy used in this study focused on defining hMSC functional subpopulations based in particular on their Thy-1 (CD90) antigen (Ag) surface expression. Methods The effect of different in vitro microenvironmental conditions on the isolation and expansion of bone marrow-derived (BM) hMSC from hematologic malignancies (HM) and normal samples (NS) was assayed. hMSC clonogenic and differentiation potential, phenotypic profile and long-term capacity to sustain in vitro hemopoiesis were considered in relation to the different expansion protocols. Results The results showed that angiogenic supplements used in combination with low serum content gave rise to the appearance of Thy-1- HM-MSC with high proliferative potential, capable of restoring the typical HM stromal impairment. The expression of the CD271 was partially maintained. We further report an enhancement towards the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity by the Thy-1- HM-MSC subset. Despite the angiogenic treatment, the Thy-1- MSC stopped short of full endothelial differentiation. Discussion In this paper we provide evidence that in vitro angiogenic stimuli generate HM-MSC lacking CD90 Ag expression. The Thy-1- MSC subset is characterized by peculiar functional and phenotypic characteristics, thus supporting the role played by the microenvironment in selecting particular hMSC subsets maintaining normal tissue homeostasis or inducing pathologic processes.

Fibroblastic reticulum cells, follicular dendritic cells and a third superficial stromal cell type	IMMUNOLOGY												At least three phenotypically and morphologically distinguishable types of branched stromal cells are revealed in the human splenic white pulp by subtractive immunohistological double-staining. CD271 is expressed in fibroblastic reticulum cells of T-cell zones and in follicular dendritic cells of follicles. In addition, there is a third CD271(-) and CD271(+/-) stromal cell population surrounding T-cell zones and follicles. At the surface of follicles the third population consists of individually variable partially overlapping shells of stromal cells exhibiting CD90 (Thy-1), MAdCAM-1, CD105 (endoglin), CD141 (thrombomodulin) and smooth muscle a-actin (SMA) with expression of CD90 characterizing the broadest shell and SMA the smallest. In addition, CXCL12, CXCL13 and CCL21 are also present in third-population stromal cells and/or along fibres. Not only CD27(+) and switched B lymphocytes, but also scattered IgD(++) B lymphocytes and variable numbers of CD4(+) T lymphocytes often occur close to the third stromal cell population or one of its subpopulations at the surface of the follicles. In contrast to human lymph nodes, neither podoplanin nor RANKL (CD254) were detected in adult human splenic white pulp stromal cells. The superficial stromal cells of the human splenic white pulp belong to a widespread cell type, which is also found at the surface of red pulp arterioles surrounded by a mixed T-cell/B-cell population. Superficial white pulp stromal cells differ from fibroblastic reticulum cells and follicular dendritic cells not only in humans, but apparently also in mice and perhaps in rats. However, the phenotype of white pulp stromal cells is species-specific and more heterogeneous than described so far.

J	Rigato, M; Monami, M; Fadini, GP				Rigato, Mauro; Monami, Matteo; Fadini, Gian Paolo			Autologous Cell Therapy for Peripheral Arterial Disease Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized, Nonrandomized, and Noncontrolled Studies	CIRCULATION RESEARCH												Rationale: Critical limb ischemia is a life-threatening complication of peripheral arterial disease. In patients who are ineligible for revascularization procedures, there are few therapeutic alternatives, leading to amputations and death. Objective: To provide a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of studies evaluating safety and efficacy of autologous cell therapy for intractable peripheral arterial disease/critical limb ischemia. Methods and Results: We retrieved 19 randomized controlled trials (837 patients), 7 nonrandomized trials (338 patients), and 41 noncontrolled studies (1177 patients). The primary outcome was major amputation. Heterogeneity was high, and publication bias could not be excluded. Despite these limitations, the primary analysis (all randomized controlled trials) showed that cell therapy reduced the risk of amputation by 37%, improved amputation-free survival by 18%, and improved wound healing by 59%, without affecting mortality. Cell therapy significantly increased ankle brachial index, increased transcutaneous oxygen tension, and reduced rest pain. The secondary analysis (all controlled trials; n= 1175 patients) shows that there may be potential to avoid approximate to 1 amputation/year for every 2 patients successfully treated. The tertiary analysis (all studies; n=2332 patients) precisely estimated the changes in ankle brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen tension, rest pain, and walking capacity after cell therapy. Intramuscular implantation appeared more effective than intra-arterial infusion, and mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells may outperform bone marrow-mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Amputation rate was improved more in trials wherein the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was high. Cell therapy was not associated with severe adverse events. Remarkably, efficacy of cell therapy on all end points was no longer significant in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials and disappeared in randomized controlled trials with a low risk of bias. Conclusions: Although this meta-analysis highlights the need for more high-quality placebo-controlled trials, equipoise may no longer be guaranteed because autologous cell therapy has the potential to modify the natural history of intractable critical limb ischemia.

Pluripotent Stem Cell miRNAs and Metastasis in Invasive Breast Cancer	JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE												Background The purpose of this study is to determine whether microRNA for pluripotent stem cells are also expressed in breast cancer and are associated with metastasis and outcome. Methods We studied global microRNA profiles during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (n = 26) and in breast cancer patients (n = 33) and human cell lines (n = 35). Using in situ hybridization, we then investigated MIR302 expression in 318 untreated breast cancer patients (test cohort, n = 22 and validation cohort, n = 296). In parallel, using next-generation sequencing data from breast cancer patients (n = 684), we assessed microRNA association with stem cell markers. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results In healthy tissues, the MIR302 (high)/MIR203 (low) asymmetry was exclusive for pluripotent stem cells. MIR302 was expressed in a small population of cancer cells within invasive ductal carcinoma, but not in normal breast (P < .001). Furthermore, MIR302 was expressed in the tumor cells together with stem cell markers, such as CD44 and BMI1. Conversely, MIR203 expression in 684 breast tumors negatively correlated with CD44 (Spearman correlation, Rho = -0.08, P = .04) and BMI1 (Rho = -0.11, P = .004), but positively correlated with differentiation marker CD24 (Rho = 0.15, P < .001). Primary tumors with lymph node metastasis had cancer cells showing scattered expression of MIR302 and widespread repression of MIR203. Finally, overall survival was statistically significantly shorter in patients with MIR302-positive cancer cells (P = .03). Conclusions In healthy tissues the MIR302(high)/MIR203(low) asymmetry was characteristic of embryonic and induced pluripotency. In invasive ductal carcinoma, the MIR302/MIR203 asymmetry was associated with stem cell markers, metastasis, and shorter survival.				marchesini, jlenia jm/K-2872-2016; Negrini, Massimo/J-2377-2016; Volinia, Stefano/AAA-9264-2019; Gasparini, Pierluigi/ABA-2811-2021; Volinia, Stefano/A-3029-2010; Young, Richard A/F-6495-2012; Galasso, Marco/K-2037-2016	marchesini, jlenia jm/0000-0002-1911-5938; Negrini, Massimo/0000-0002-0007-1920; Volinia, Stefano/0000-0003-0910-3893; Gasparini, Pierluigi/0000-0001-8311-8845; Volinia, Stefano/0000-0003-0910-3893; Young, Richard A/0000-0001-8855-8647; Di Leva, Gianpiero/0000-0001-6759-8682; Dama, Paola/0000-0001-5716-9665; Vecchione, Andrea/0000-0002-5497-6856; Galasso, Marco/0000-0003-2655-4792; Manfrini, Marco/0000-0003-3154-9269; Previati, Maurizio/0000-0002-2912-4029; Garofalo, Michela/0000-0002-1741-0415												0027-8874	1460-2105				DEC	2014	106	12							dju324	10.1093/jnci/dju324							WOS:000348593200021	25306216

However, subcutaneous models poorly resemble tumor complexity due to the fast growth not reflecting the natural course. Here, we describe an application of the new spheroid-plug model to combine the simplicity of subcutaneous injection with improved resemblance to natural tumor progression. Spheroid-plug model relies on in vitro formation of tumor spheroids, followed by injection of single tumor spheroid subcutaneously in Matrigel matrix. In spheroid-plug model, tumors grow slower in comparison to tumors formed by injection of cell suspension as assessed by 3D ultrasonography (USG) and in vivo bioluminescence measurements. The slower tumor growth rate in spheroid-plug model is accompanied by reduced necrosis. The spheroid-plug model ensures increased and more stable vascularization of tumor than classical subcutaneous tumor model as demonstrated by 3D USG Power Doppler examination. Flow cytometry analysis showed that tumors formed from spheroids have enhanced infiltration of endothelial cells as well as hematopoietic and progenitor cells with stem cell phenotype (c-Kit(+) and Sca-1(+)). They also contain more tumor cells expressing cancer stem cell marker CXCR4. Here, we show that spheroid-plug model allows investigating efficiency of anticancer drugs. Treatment of spheroid-plug tumors with known antiangiogenic agent axitinib decreased their size and viability. The antiangiogenic activity of axitinib was higher in spheroid-plug model than in classical model. Our results indicate that spheroid-plug model imitates natural tumor growth and can become a valuable tool for cancer research.

In particular, optimized short-term culture-enriching patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) are essential for customizing the therapeutic strategy based on clinically feasible in vitro drug screening for a wide range of DIGs, owing to the high inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Herein, we constructed a novel high-throughput culture condition screening platform called 'GFSCAN', which evaluated the cellular growth rates of GSCs for each DIG sample in 132 serum-free combinations, using 13 previously reported growth factors closely associated with glioma aggressiveness. In total, 72 patient-derived GSCs with available genomic profiles were tested in GFSCAN to explore the association between cellular growth rates in specific growth factor combinations and genomic/molecular backgrounds, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, chromosome arm 1p and 19q co-deletion, ATRX chromatin remodeler alteration, and transcriptional subtype. GSCs were clustered according to the dependency on epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (E&F), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) wild-type GSCs showed higher E&F dependencies than IDH1 mutant GSCs. More importantly, we elucidated optimal combinations for IDH1 mutant glioblastoma and lower grade glioma GSCs with low dependencies on E&F, which could be an aid in clinical decision-making for these DIGs. Thus, we demonstrated the utility of GFSCAN in personalizing in vitro cultivation to nominate personalized therapeutic options, in a clinically relevant time frame, for individual DIG patients, where standard clinical options have been exhausted.

Single-cell differences in matrix gene expression do not predict matrix deposition	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, complicating their use in regenerative medicine. However, conventional bulk assays mask this variability. Here we show that both chondrocytes and chondrogenically induced MSCs exhibit substantial mRNA expression heterogeneity. Single-molecule RNA FISH to measure mRNA expression of differentiation markers in single cells reveals that sister cell pairs have high levels of mRNA variability, suggesting that marker expression is not heritable. Surprisingly, this variability does not correlate with cell-to-cell differences in cartilage-like matrix production. Transcriptome-wide analysis suggests that no combination of markers can predict functional potential. De-differentiating chondrocytes also show a disconnect between mRNA expression of the cartilage marker aggrecan and cartilage-like matrix accumulation. Altogether, these quantitative analyses suggest that sorting subpopulations based on these markers would only marginally enrich the progenitor population for ' superior' MSCs. Our results suggest that instantaneous mRNA abundance of canonical markers is tenuously linked to the chondrogenic phenotype at the single-cell level.

Pathologic Stimulus Determines Lineage Commitment of Cardiac C-kit(+) Cells	CIRCULATION												BACKGROUND: Although cardiac c-kit(+) cells are being tested in clinical trials, the circumstances that determine lineage differentiation of c-kit(+) cells in vivo are unknown. Recent findings suggest that endogenous cardiac c-kit(+) cells rarely contribute cardiomyocytes to the adult heart. We assessed whether various pathological stimuli differentially affect the eventual cell fates of c-kit(+) cells. METHODS: We used single-cell sequencing and genetic lineage tracing of c-kit(+) cells to determine whether various pathological stimuli would result in different fates of c-kit(+) cells. RESULTS: Single-cell sequencing of cardiac CD45-c-kit(+) cells showed innate heterogeneity, indicative of the existence of vascular and mesenchymal c-kit(+) cells in normal hearts. Cardiac pressure overload resulted in a modest increase in c-kit-derived cardiomyocytes, with significant increases in the numbers of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Doxorubicin-induced acute cardiotoxicity did not increase c-kit-derived endothelial cell fates but instead induced cardiomyocyte differentiation. Mechanistically, doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in c-kit(+) cells resulted in expression of p53. Inhibition of p53 blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation in response to doxorubicin, whereas stabilization of p53 was sufficient to increase c-kit-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that different pathological stimuli induce different cell fates of c-kit(+) cells in vivo. Although the overall rate of cardiomyocyte formation from c-kit(+) cells is still below clinically relevant levels, we show that p53 is central to the ability of c-kit(+) cells to adopt cardiomyocyte fates, which could lead to the development of strategies to preferentially generate cardiomyocytes from c-kit(+) cells.

Clonal expansion within 3D soft microenvironments supported cellular stemness of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) evenwithoutpluripotentmedia, andit improvedepigenetic reprogrammingefficiency ofmouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Although differences between intrinsic breast cancer subtypes have been well studied, heterogeneity within each subtype, especially luminal-A cancers, requires further interrogation to personalize disease management. Here, we applied well-characterized and cancer-associated heterocellular signatures representing stem, mesenchymal, stromal, immune, and epithelial cell types to breast cancer. This analysis stratified the luminal-A breast cancer samples into five subtypes with a majority of them enriched for a subtype (stem-like) that has increased stem and stromal cell gene signatures, representing potential luminal progenitor origin. The enrichment of immune checkpoint genes and other immune cell types in two (including stem-like) of the five heterocellular subtypes of luminal-A tumors suggest their potential response to immunotherapy. These immune-enriched subtypes of luminal-A tumors (containing only estrogen receptor positive samples) showed good or intermediate prognosis along with the two other differentiated subtypes as assessed using recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free patient survival outcomes. On the other hand, a partially differentiated subtype of luminal-A breast cancer with transit-amplifying colon-crypt characteristics showed poor prognosis. Furthermore, published luminal-A subtypes associated with specific somatic copy number alterations and mutations shared similar cellular and mutational characteristics to colorectal cancer subtypes where the heterocellular signatures were derived. These heterocellular subtypes reveal transcriptome and cell-type based heterogeneity of luminal-A and other breast cancer subtypes that may be useful for additional understanding of the cancer type and potential patient stratification and personalized medicine.

By assessing the transcriptional response of a diploid human colonic epithelial cell line to BMP ligand stimulation, we generated a prognostic BMP signalling signature, which was applied to multiple CRC datasets to investigate BMP heterogeneity across CRC molecular subtypes. We linked BMP and Notch signalling pathway activity and function in human colonic epithelial cells, and normal and neoplastic tissue. BMP induced Notch througha gamma-secretase- independent interaction, regulated by the SMAD proteins. In homeostasis, BMP/Notch co-localization was restricted to cells at the top of the intestinal crypt, with more widespread interaction in some human CRC samples. BMP signalling was downregulated in the majority of CRCs, but was conserved specifically in mesenchymal-subtype tumours, where it interacts with Notch to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. In intestinal homeostasis, BMP-Notch pathway crosstalk is restricted to differentiating cells through stringent pathway segregation. Conserved BMP activity and loss of signalling stringency in mesenchymal-subtype tumours promotes a synergistic BMP-Notch interaction, and this correlates with poor patient prognosis. BMP signalling heterogeneity across CRC subtypes and cell lines can account for previous experimental contradictions. Crosstalk between the BMP and Notch pathways will render mesenchymal-subtype CRC insensitive to gamma-secretase inhibition unless BMP activation is concomitantly addressed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Genomic profiling studies highlighted the high level of heterogeneity of this cancer, which comprises different subtypes with unique phenotypes and response to treatment. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) is an established mesenchymal/stem cell-specific marker in human glioblastoma and, as recently suggested, it may uniquely mark breast cancer cells with stem-like characteristics and/or that have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis for PDGFR beta expression was performed on a human TNBC tissue microarray. Functional assays were conducted on mesenchymal-like TNBC cells to investigate the effect of a previously validated PDGFR beta aptamer on invasive cell growth in three-dimensional culture conditions, migration, invasion and tube formation. The aptamer was labeled with a near-infrared (NIR) dye and its binding specificity to PDGFR beta was assessed both in vitro (confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses) and in vivo (fluorescence molecular tomography in mice bearing TNBC xenografts). A mouse model of TNBC lung metastases formation was established and NIR-labeled PDGFR beta aptamer was used to detect lung metastases in mice untreated or intravenously injected with unlabeled aptamer. Results: Here, we present novel data showing that tumor cell expression of PDGFR beta identifies a subgroup of mesenchymal tumors with invasive and stem-like phenotype, and propose a previously unappreciated role for PDGFR beta in driving TNBC cell invasiveness and metastases formation. We show that the PDGFR beta aptamer blocked invasive growth and migration/invasion of mesenchymal TNBC cell lines and prevented TNBC lung metastases formation. Further, upon NIR-labeling, the aptamer specifically bound to TNBC xenografts and detected lung metastases. Conclusions: We propose PDGFR beta as a reliable biomarker of a subgroup of mesenchymal TNBCs with invasive and stem-like phenotype as well as the use of the PDGFR beta aptamer as a high efficacious tool for imaging and suppression of TNBC lung metastases. This study will allow for the significant expansion of the current repertoire of strategies for managing patients with more aggressive TNBC.

During RT therapy, cells can gradually acquire resistance implying adaptive radioresistance. Here we probe the mechanisms underlying this acquired resistance by first establishing radioresistant lines using ZR-75-1 and MCF-7 BC cells through repeated exposure to sub-lethal fractionated dose of 2Gy up to 15 fractions. Radioresistance was found to be associated with increased cancer stem cells (CSCs), and elevated EpCAM expression in the cell population. A retrospective analysis of TCGA dataset indicated positive correlation of high EpCAM expression with poor response to RT. Intriguingly, elevated EpCAM expression in the radioresistant CSCs raise the bigger question of how this biomarker expression contributes during radiation treatment in BC. Thereafter, we establish EpCAM overexpressing ZR-75-1 cells (ZR-75-1(EpCAM)), which conferred radioresistance, increased stemness through enhanced AKT activation and induced a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced contractility and invasiveness. In line with these observations, orthotopic implantation of ZR-75-1(EpCAM) cells exhibited faster growth, lesser sensitivity to radiation therapy and increased lung metastasis than baseline ZR-75-1 cells in mice. In summary, this study shows that similar to radioresistant BC cells, EpCAM overexpressing cells show high degree of plasticity and heterogeneity which ultimately induces radioresistant and metastatic behavior of cancer cells, thus aggravating the disease condition.

Especially for tendon disease where cell-based therapy is commonly used in equine patients, the translation of achieved results to human medicine would be a great accomplishment. Immunophenotyping of equine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains the last obstacle to meet the criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) definition of human MSCs. Therefore, the surface antigen expression of CD 29, CD 44, CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, CD 14, CD 34, CD 45, CD 79 alpha, and MHC II in equine MSCs from adipose tissue, bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord tissue, and tendon tissue was analyzed using flow cytometry. Isolated cells from the different sources and donors varied in their expression pattern of MSC-defining antigens. In particular, CD 90 and 105 showed most heterogeneity. However, cells from all samples were robustly positive for CD 29 and CD 44, while being mostly negative for CD 73 and the exclusion markers CD 14, CD 34, CD 45, CD 79a and MHC II. Furthermore, it was evident that enzymes used for cell detachment after in vitro-culture affected the detection of antigen expression. These results emphasize the need of standardization of MSC isolation, culturing, and harvesting techniques. As the equine MSCs did not meet all criteria the ISCT defined for human MSCs, further investigations for a better characterization of the cell type should be conducted.

Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Activates PERK-eIF2 alpha and Sensitizes Cells to Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress	CANCER DISCOVERY												Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes both tumor progression and drug resistance, yet few vulnerabilities of this state have been identified. Using selective small molecules as cellular probes, we show that induction of EMT greatly sensitizes cells to agents that perturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. This sensitivity to ER perturbations is caused by the synthesis and secretion of large quantities of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by EMT cells. Consistent with their increased secretory output, EMT cells display a branched ER morphology and constitutively activate the PERK-eIF2 alpha axis of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) activation is also required for EMT cells to invade and metastasize. In human tumor tissues, EMT gene expression correlates strongly with both ECM and PERK-eIF2 alpha genes, but not with other branches of the UPR. Taken together, our findings identify a novel vulnerability of EMT cells, and demonstrate that the PERK branch of the UPR is required for their malignancy. SIGNIFICANCE: EMT drives tumor metastasis and drug resistance, highlighting the need for therapies that target this malignant subpopulation. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized vulnerability of cancer cells that have undergone an EMT: sensitivity to ER stress. We also find that PERK-eIF2 alpha signaling, which is required to maintain ER homeostasis, is also indispensable for EMT cells to invade and metastasize.																	2159-8274	2159-8290				JUN	2014	4	6					702	715		10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0945							WOS:000337185500026	24705811

Marked differences in the genetic and epigenetic backgrounds of cancer cells have been revealed by advances in genome sequencing, yet little is known about the phenotypic landscape and the spatial distribution of intratumoral heterogeneity within solid tumours. Here, we show that three-dimensional light-sheet microscopy of cleared solid tumours can identify unique patterns of phenotypic heterogeneity, in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and in angiogenesis, at single-cell resolution in whole formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy samples. We also show that cleared FFPE samples can be re-embedded in paraffin after examination for future use, and that our tumour-phenotyping pipeline can determine tumour stage and stratify patient prognosis from clinical samples with higher accuracy than current diagnostic methods, thus facilitating the design of more efficient cancer therapies.

In particular, it remains to be fully elucidated how microenvironmental factors shape genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity, which in turn determine the course of tumor evolution and clinical progression. In this context, hypoxia, a hallmark of most growing cancers, characterized by decreased O-2 partial pressure is a key player of the tumor microenvironment. Despite extensive data indicating that hypoxia promotes cellular metabolic adaptation, immune suppression and various steps of tumor progression via hypoxia regulated gene transcription, much less is known about the role of hypoxia in mediating therapy resistance as a driver of tumor evolution through genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss recent evidence supporting a prominent role of hypoxia as a driver of tumor heterogeneity and highlight the multifaceted manner by which this in turn could impact cancer evolution, reprogramming and immune escape. Finally, we will discuss how detailed knowledge of the hypoxic footprint may open up new therapeutic avenues for the management of cancer.

Here we identify a fundamental role for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in driving BCSC expansion, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity, defining it as a key target of miR200c, which is known to be a critical regulator in BCSC. Pin1 overexpression expanded the growth and tumorigenicity of BCSC and triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 reduced the abundance and self-renewal activity of BCSC. Moreover, moderate overexpression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 rescued the BCSC defect in miR200c-expressing cells. Genetic deletion of Pin1 also decreased the abundance and repopulating capability of normal mouse mammary stem cells. In human cells, freshly isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, Pin1 overexpression endowed BCSC traits to normal breast epithelial cells, expanding both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages in these cells. In contrast, Pin1 silencing in primary breast cancer cells freshly isolated from clinical samples inhibited the expansion, self-renewal activity, and tumorigenesis of BCSC in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrated that Pin1 is a pivotal regulator acting downstream of miR200c to drive BCSC and breast tumorigenicity, highlighting a new therapeutic target to eradicate BCSC.

To contribute to revealing the cell types that may originate this tumor, we exploited mass cytometry, a single-cell technique that, by using heavy-metal-tagged antibodies, allows the accurate monitoring of the changes occurring in the mononuclear cell composition of skeletal muscle tissue during tumor development. To this end, we compared cell populations of healthy muscles with those from spatiotemporal-induced eRMS tumors in a mouse model (LSL-Kras(G12D/+);Tp53(Fl/Fl)) that can be used to develop rhabdomyosarcoma by means of infection with an adenovirus vector expressing Cre (Ad-Cre) recombinase. By monitoring different time points after tumor induction, we were able to analyze tumor progression and composition, identifying fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) as the cell type that, in this model system, had a pivotal role in tumor development. In vitro studies highlighted that both FAPs and satellite cells (SCs), upon infection with the Ad-Cre, acquired the potential to develop rhabdomyosarcomas when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. However, only infected FAPs had an antigen profile that was similar to embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Overall, our analysis supports the involvement of FAPs in eRMS development.				petrilli, lucia lisa/AAI-2076-2019; pasquini, luca/J-8319-2016; Palma, Alessandro/AAQ-4351-2021	petrilli, lucia lisa/0000-0001-6453-3031; pasquini, luca/0000-0002-3484-6288; Fuoco, Claudia/0000-0001-8372-305X; Castagnoli, Luisa/0000-0001-5283-8671; Riccio, Federica/0000-0003-2939-3306; Sacco, Francesca/0000-0001-5586-9529; Palma, Alessandro/0000-0003-1300-5479; Giuliani, Giulio/0000-0002-4648-0076; Gargioli, Cesare/0000-0003-1742-3969													2077-0383				FEB	2021	10	4							823	10.3390/jcm10040823							WOS:000624028900001	33671425					
J	Aubin, JE; Heersche, JNM				Aubin, JE; Heersche, JNM			Osteoprogenitor cell differentiation to mature bone-forming osteoblasts	DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH												Osteoblasts are the skeletal cells responsible for synthesis, deposition and mineralization of the extracellular matrix of bone. By mechanisms that are only beginning to be understood, stem cells, primitive osteoprogenitors and related mesenchymal precursors arise in the embryo where they participate in development of the skeleton; at least some persist in the adult organism, where they contribute to replacement of osteoblasts in bone turnover and in fracture healing. However, many questions remain as to the nature of these precursor cell pools, including which cells constitute a stem cell pool vs, a committed progenitor pool, which pools persist in adult life and which constitute targets for hormones, cytokines, and growth factors during bone formation, turnover, and repair. During osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation, a series of cellular and molecular events occur that are characterized by sequential up- and downregulation of osteoblast-associated genes, including those for specific transcription factors, cell cycle-related proteins, adhesion molecules, and matrix proteins; together these result in a mature matrix-synthesizing osteoblast. However, the mature osteoblast phenotype is itself heterogeneous, with subpopulations of osteoblasts expressing only subsets of the known osteoblast markers, raising intriguing questions, including how different pools of osteoblasts or their precursors may respond to therapeutic agents.

Attempts to fill this gap are emerging. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) reported two main CRC groups, based on the incidence and spectrum of mutated genes, and another paper reported an EMT expression signature defined subgroup. We performed a prior free analysis of CRC heterogeneity on 1113 CRC gene expression profiles and confronted our findings to established molecular determinants and clinical, histopathological and survival data. Unsupervised clustering based on gene modules allowed us to distinguish at least five different gene expression CRC subtypes, which we call surface crypt-like, lower crypt-like, CIMP-H-like, mesenchymal and mixed. A gene set enrichment analysis combined with literature search of gene module members identified distinct biological motifs in different subtypes. The subtypes, which were not derived based on outcome, nonetheless showed differences in prognosis. Known gene copy number variations and mutations in key cancer-associated genes differed between subtypes, but the subtypes provided molecular information beyond that contained in these variables. Morphological features significantly differed between subtypes. The objective existence of the subtypes and their clinical and molecular characteristics were validated in an independent set of 720 CRC expression profiles. Our subtypes provide a novel perspective on the heterogeneity of CRC. The proposed subtypes should be further explored retrospectively on existing clinical trial datasets and, when sufficiently robust, be prospectively assessed for clinical relevance in terms of prognosis and treatment response predictive capacity.

J	Stanton, AE; Tong, XM; Yang, F				Stanton, Alice E.; Tong, Xinming; Yang, Fan			Varying solvent type modulates collagen coating and stem cell mechanotransduction on hydrogel substrates	APL BIOENGINEERING												Type I collagen is the most abundant extracellular matrix protein in the human body and is commonly used as a biochemical ligand for hydrogel substrates to support cell adhesion in mechanotransduction studies. Previous protocols for conjugating collagen I have used different solvents; yet, how varying solvent pH and composition impacts the efficiency and distribution of these collagen I coatings remains unknown. Here, we examine the effect of varying solvent pH and type on the efficiency and distribution of collagen I coatings on polyacrylamide hydrogels. We further evaluate the effects of varying solvent on mechanotransduction of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by characterizing cell spreading and localization of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a key transcriptional regulator of mechanotransduction. Increasing solvent pH to 5.2 and above increased the heterogeneity of coating with collagen bundle formation. Collagen I coating highly depends on the solvent type, with acetic acid leading to the highest conjugation efficiency and most homogeneous coating. Compared to HEPES or phosphate-buffered saline buffer, acetic acid-dissolved collagen I coatings substantially enhance MSC adhesion and spreading on both glass and polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates. When acetic acid was used for collagen coatings, even the low collagen concentration (1 mu g/ml) induced robust MSC spreading and nuclear YAP localization on both soft (3 kPa) and stiff (38 kPa) substrates. Depending on the solvent type, stiffness-dependent nuclear YAP translocation occurs at a different collagen concentration. Together, the results from this study validate the solvent type as an important parameter to consider when using collagen I as the biochemical ligand to support cell adhesion.

Both mouse and human MSCs ameliorate autoimmune disease in syn-, allo-and xenogeneic settings. However, MSC preparations are heterogeneous which impairs their therapeutic efficacy and endorses variability between experiments. This heterogeneity has also been a main hurdle in translating experimental MSC data from mouse models to human patients. The objective of the present manuscript has been to further characterize murine MSCs (mMSCs) with the aim of designing more efficient and specific MSC-based therapies. We have found that mMSCs are heterogeneous for endoglin (CD105) expression and that this heterogeneity is not due to different stages of MSC differentiation. CD105 is induced on a subpopulation of mMSCs early upon in vitro culture giving rise to CD105(+) and CD105(-) MSCs. CD105(+) and CD105(-) mMSCs represent independent subpopulations that maintain their properties upon several passages. CD105 expression on CD105(+) mMSCs was affected by passage number and cell confluency while CD105(-) mMSCs remained negative. The CD105(+) and CD105(-) mMSC subpopulations had similar growth potential and expressed almost identical mMSC markers (CD29(+)CD44(+)Sca1 (+) MHC-I+ and CD45(-)CD11b(-)CD31(-)) but varied in their differentiation and immunoregulatory properties. Interestingly, CD105-mMSCs were more prone to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes and suppressed the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells more efficiently compared to CD105+ mMSCs. Based on these studies we propose to redefine the phenotype of mMSCs based on CD105 expression.

Many studies have demonstrated that proliferation and cellular morphology are affected by these supplements - it is therefore important to determine if they favor outgrowth of different subpopulations and thereby impact on the heterogeneous composition of MSCs. We have isolated and expanded human bone marrow-derived MSCs in parallel with HPL or FCS and demonstrated that HPL significantly increases proliferation and leads to dramatic differences in cellular morphology. Remarkably, global DNA-methylation profiles did not reveal any significant differences. Even at the transcriptomic level, there were only moderate changes in pairwise comparison. Furthermore, the effects on proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, and focal adhesions were reversible by interchanging to opposite culture conditions. These results indicate that cultivation of MSCs with HPL or FCS has no systematic bias for specific cell types.

However, our understanding of the relationship between the heterogeneity of morphological phenotypes and the underlying transcriptome is still limited. To address this issue, we here introduce "pheno-seq" to directly link visual features of 3D cell culture systems with profiling their transcriptome. As prototypic applications breast and colorectal cancer (CRC) spheroids were analyzed by pheno-seq. We identified characteristic gene expression signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that are associated with invasive growth behavior of clonal breast cancer spheroids. Furthermore, we linked long-term proliferative capacity in a patient-derived model of CRC to a lowly abundant PROX1-positive cancer stem cell subtype. We anticipate that the ability to integrate transcriptome analysis and morphological patho-phenotypes of cancer cells will provide novel insight on the molecular origins of intratumor heterogeneity.

Through RNA-sequencing of 100,987 individual cells from 7 primary, 2 recurrent, and 2 lung metastatic osteosarcoma lesions, 11 major cell clusters are identified based on unbiased clustering of gene expression profiles and canonical markers. The transcriptomic properties, regulators and dynamics of osteosarcoma malignant cells together with their tumor microenvironment particularly stromal and immune cells are characterized. The transdifferentiation of malignant osteoblastic cells from malignant chondroblastic cells is revealed by analyses of inferred copy-number variation and trajectory. A proinflammatory FABP4(+) macrophages infiltration is noticed in lung metastatic osteosarcoma lesions. Lower osteoclasts infiltration is observed in chondroblastic, recurrent and lung metastatic osteosarcoma lesions compared to primary osteoblastic osteosarcoma lesions. Importantly, TIGIT blockade enhances the cytotoxicity effects of the primary CD3(+) T cells with high proportion of TIGIT(+) cells against osteosarcoma. These results present a single-cell atlas, explore intratumor heterogeneity, and provide potential therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma. Osteosarcomas are difficult to treat and have a limited response to immunotherapy. Here, the authors analyse osteosarcomas at the single-cell level, and identify both the transdifferentiation of malignant cells and an array of immune cells that could have implications for metastasis and immunotherapy.					tjyqc, yang/0000-0002-6600-5467; pan, xinghua/0000-0002-7421-8155; Qian, Binzhi/0000-0002-5796-1078												2041-1723					DEC 10	2020	11	1							6322	10.1038/s41467-020-20059-6							WOS:000599795600001	33303760

Proapoptotic PUMA targets stem-like breast cancer cells to suppress metastasis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION												Breast cancer cells with stem cell properties are key contributors to metastatic disease, and there remains a need to better understand and target these cells in human cancers. Here, we identified rare stem-like cells in patients' tumors characterized by low levels of the proapoptotic molecule p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and showed that these cells play a critical role in tumor progression that is independent of clinical subtype. A signaling axis consisting of the integrin alpha v beta 3, Src kinase, and the transcription factor Slug suppresses PUMA in these cells, promoting tumor stemness. We showed that genetic or pharmacological disruption of alpha v beta 3/Src signaling drives PUMA expression, specifically depleting these stem-like tumor cells; increases their sensitivity to apoptosis; and reduces pulmonary metastasis, with no effect on primary tumor growth. Taken together, these findings point to PUMA as a key vulnerability of stem-like cells and suggest that pharmacological upregulation of PUMA via Src inhibition may represent a strategy to selectively target these cells in a wide spectrum of aggressive breast cancers.

Identification of Selective Inhibitors of Cancer Stem Cells by High-Throughput Screening	CELL												Screens for agents that specifically kill epithelial cancer stem cells (CSCs) have not been possible due to the rarity of these cells within tumor cell populations and their relative instability in culture. We describe here an approach to screening for agents with epithelial CSC-specific toxicity. We implemented this method in a chemical screen and discovered compounds showing selective toxicity for breast CSCs. One compound, salinomycin, reduces the proportion of CSCs by > 100-fold relative to paclitaxel, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug. Treatment of mice with salinomycin inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo and induces increased epithelial differentiation of tumor cells. In addition, global gene expression analyses show that salinomycin treatment results in the loss of expression of breast CSC genes previously identified by analyses of breast tissues isolated directly from patients. This study demonstrates the ability to identify agents with specific toxicity for epithelial CSCs.

Their identity has been linked to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) but remains highly controversial since-depending on the cell-line studied-either epithelial (E) or mesenchymal (M) markers, alone or together have been associated with stemness. Using distinct transcript expression signatures characterizing the three different E, M and hybrid E/M cell-types, our data support a novel model that links a mixed EM signature with stemness in 1) individual cells, 2) luminal and basal cell lines, 3) in vivo xenograft mouse models, and 4) in all breast cancer subtypes. In particular, we found that co-expression of E and M signatures was associated with poorest outcome in luminal and basal breast cancer patients as well as with enrichment for stem-like cells in both E and M breast cell-lines. This link between a mixed EM expression signature and stemness was explained by two findings: first, mixed cultures of E and M cells showed increased cooperation in mammosphere formation (indicative of stemness) compared to the more differentiated E and M cell-types. Second, singlecell qPCR analysis revealed that E and M genes could be co-expressed in the same cell. These hybrid E/M cells were generated by both E or M cells and had a combination of several stem-like traits since they displayed increased plasticity, self-renewal, mammosphere formation, and produced ALDH1+ progenies, while more differentiated M cells showed less plasticity and E cells showed less self-renewal. Thus, the hybrid E/M state reflecting stemness and its promotion by E-M cooperation offers a dual biological rationale for the robust association of the mixed EM signature with poor prognosis, independent of cellular origin. Together, our model explains previous paradoxical findings that breast CSCs appear to be M in luminal cell-lines but E in basal breast cancer cell-lines. Our results suggest that targeting E/M heterogeneity by eliminating hybrid E/M cells and cooperation between E and M cell-types could improve breast cancer patient survival independent of breast cancer-subtype.

Articular cartilage is organized into several layers and lack of zonal organization of current grafts is held responsible for insufficient biomechanical and biochemical quality of repair-tissue. The aim was to develop a zonal approach for cartilage regeneration to determine whether the outcome can be improved compared to a non-zonal strategy. Hydrogel-filled polycaprolactone (PCL)-constructs with a chondrocyte-seeded upper-layer deemed to induce hyaline cartilage and a mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-containing bottom-layer deemed to induce calcified cartilage were compared to chondrocyte-based non-zonal grafts in a minipig model. Grafts showed comparable hardness at implantation and did not cause visible signs of inflammation. After 6 months, X-ray microtomography (mu CT)-analysis revealed significant bone-loss in both treatment groups compared to empty controls. PCL-enforcement and some hydrogel-remnants were retained in all defects, but most implants were pressed into the subchondral bone. Despite important heterogeneities, both treatments reached a significantly lower modified O'Driscoll-score compared to empty controls. Thus, PCL may have induced bone-erosion during joint loading and misplacement of grafts in vivo precluding adequate permanent orientation of zones compared to surrounding native cartilage.

Therefore, it is mandatory to refine the characteristics of these cells to monitor their survival and develop adapted therapies. This is of particular interest in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), for which the 5-year survival rate only reaches 30%, regardless of the prognosis. The role of the microenvironment is increasingly reported to be a key regulator for blast survival. In this context, we demonstrate that contact with mesenchymal stromal cells promotes a better survival of blasts in culture in the presence of anthracycline through the activation of ABC transporters. Stroma-dependent ABC transporter activation leads to the induction of a Side Population (SP) phenotype in a subpopulation of primary leukemia blasts through alpha (alpha)4 engagement. The stroma-promoting effect is reversible and is observed with stromal cells isolated from either healthy donors or leukemia patients. Blasts expressing an SP phenotype are mostly quiescent and are chemoresistant in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. At the transcriptomic level, blasts from the SP are specifically enriched in the drug metabolism program. This detoxification signature engaged in contact with mesenchymal stromal cells represents promising ways to target stroma-induced chemoresistance of AML cells.				desterke, christophe/AAM-7083-2021; Trignol, Aurelie/Q-5900-2018; Anginot, Adrienne/N-9299-2017	desterke, christophe/0000-0001-7679-2524; Trignol, Aurelie/0000-0002-7084-6330; Segot, Amandine/0000-0003-2408-3579; FARGE, Thomas/0000-0002-4390-8073												0390-6078					APR	2020	105	4					987	998		10.3324/haematol.2018.214379							WOS:000522793900032	31289201

However, it is unknown whether the same is true in pigs. This study investigated MSC subpopulations in miniature pig and compared their characteristics in young (2 to 3 months) and adult (27 to 35 months) pigs. Methods: Osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic capacity of isolated MSCs was evaluated by von Kossa, Alcian blue, and oil red O staining, respectively. Cell surface antigen expression was determined by flow cytometry. Proliferative capacity was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Expression of marker genes was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Porcine MSCs comprised cells with trilineage and bilineage differentiation potential (tMSCs and bMSCs, respectively) and non-differentiating stromal cells (NDSCs). The tMSC and bMSC fractions were smaller in adult than in young pigs (63.0% vs 71.2% and 11.6% vs 24.0%, respectively, p<0.05); NDSCs showed the opposite trend (25.4% vs 4.8%; p<0.05). Subpopulations showed no differences in morphology, cell surface antigen expression, or proliferative capacity, but octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) expression was higher in tMSCs than in bMSCs and NDSCs (p<0.05), whereas sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) expression was higher in tMSCs and bMSCs than in NDSCs (p<0.05). Aging had no effect on these trends. Conclusion: Porcine MSCs comprise distinct subpopulations that differ in their differentiation potential and OCT4 and SOX2 expression. Aging does not affect the characteristics of each subpopulation but alters their ratios.																	1011-2367	1976-5517				MAR	2020	33	3					515	524		10.5713/ajas.19.0416							WOS:000515129400016	32054231

Clinical applications require standardized protocols according to good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines. Donor variability as well as the intrinsic heterogeneity of MSC populations must be taken into consideration. The composition of the culture medium is a key factor in successful MSC expansion. The aim of this study was to comparatively assess the efficiency of xeno-free human platelet lysate (HPL)-based cell expansion with two commercially available media-StemPro MSC SFM CTS (for human ex vivo tissue and cell culture processing applications) and MSCGM (non-GMP-compliant, for research only) in an academic setting as the first optimization step toward GMP-compliant manufacturing. We report the feasibility of MSC expansion up to the yielded cell number with all three media. MSCs exhibited the typical fibroblastoid morphology, with distinct differences in cell size depending on the medium. The differentiation capacity and characteristic immunophenotype were confirmed for all MSC populations. Proliferation was highest using StemPro MSC SFM CTS, whereas HPL medium was more cost-effective and its composition could be adjusted individually according to the respective needs. In summary, we present a comprehensive evaluation of GMP-compatible culture media for MSC expansion. Both StemPro and HPL medium proved to be suitable for clinical application and allowed sufficient cell proliferation. Specific differences were observed and should be considered according to the intended use. This study provides a detailed cost analysis and tools that may be helpful for the establishment of GMP-compliant MSC expansion. (C) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.

In 7-day-old chick embryos Ov(+) cells were found in the para-aortic region. Also the endothelial cells of the embryonic dorsal aorta were positively stained. Ov antigen might represent a very primitive marker for precursor cells having the potentiality to differentiate both to haemopoietic and endothelial cells. Scattered CD45(+) cells were observed in the same para-aortic area as in many haemopoietic areas in the loose embryonic mesenchymal tissues.

In order to develop standardized clinical protocols, it is paramount to have a full characterization of the stem cell preparations. The surface marker expression of ASCs has previously been characterized in multiple studies. However, most of these studies have provided a cross-sectional description of ASCs in either earlier or later passages. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic changes of 15 different surface molecules during culture. Using multichromatic flow cytometry, ASCs from three different donors each in passages 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were analyzed for their co-expression of markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells, wound healing, immune regulation, ASC markers, and differentiation capacity, respectively. We confirmed that at an early stage, ASC displayed a high heterogeneity with a plethora of subpopulations, which by culturing became more homogeneous. After a few passages, virtually all ASCs expressed CD29, CD166 and CD201, in addition to canonical markers CD73, CD90, and CD105. However, even at passage 8, there were several predominant lineages that differed with respect to the expression of CD34, CD200 and CD271. Although the significance of remaining subpopulations still needs to be elucidated, our results underscore the necessity to fully characterize ASCs prior to clinical use.

We recently showed that transplantation of transgenic mammary tumors as cell suspensions into naive recipients generates reproducible tumors with remarkable stability of gene expression profile. We examined the expression profiles of original and serially transplanted mammary tumors from BrcaI deficient mice, and tumor derived cell lines to validate their use for preclinical testing and studies of tumor biology. Methods: Original tumors, serially transplanted and multiple cell lines derived from BrcaI mammary tumors were characterized by morphology, gene and protein expression, and cell surface markers. Results: Gene expression among BrcaI tumors showed more heterogeneity than among previously characterized tumors from MMTV-PyMT and -WntI models. Gene expression data segregated BrcaI tumors into 3 distinct types: basal, mixed luminal, and tumors with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Serial transplantation of individual tumors and multiple cell lines derived from the original tumors recapitulated the molecular characteristics of each tumor of origin. One tumor had distinct features of EMT and gave rise to cell lines that contained a distinct CD44(+)/CD24-/low population that may correlate with human breast cancer stem cells. Conclusion: Although individual tumors expanded by transplantation maintain the genomic profile of the original tumors, the heterogeneity among BrcaI tumors limits the extent of their use for preclinical testing. However, cell lines offer a robust material for understanding tumor biology and response to therapies driven by BRCAI deficiency.

Direct transplantation of native pericytes from adipose tissue: A new perspective to stimulate healing in critical size bone defects	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Fractures with a critical size bone defect (e.g., open fracture with segmental bone loss) are associated with high rates of delayed union and non-union. The prevention and treatment of these complications remain a serious issue in trauma and orthopaedic surgery. Autologous cancellous bone grafting is a well-established and widely used technique. However, it has drawbacks related to availability, increased morbidity and insufficient efficacy. Mesenchymal stromal cells can potentially be used to improve fracture healing. In particular, human fat tissue has been identified as a good source of multilineage adipose-derived stem cells, which can be differentiated into osteoblasts. The main issue is that mesenchymal stromal cells are a heterogeneous population of progenitors and lineage-committed cells harboring a broad range of regenerative properties. This heterogeneity is also mirrored in the differentiation potential of these cells. In the present study, we sought to test the possibility to enrich defined subpopulations of stem/progenitor cells for direct therapeutic application without requiring an in vitro expansion. Methods. We enriched a CD146+NG2+CD45-population of pericytes from freshly isolated stromal vascular fraction from mouse fat tissue and tested their osteogenic differentiation capacity in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for critical size bone injury. Results. Our results confirm the ability of enriched CD146+NG2+CD45-cells to efficiently generate osteoblasts in vitro, to colonize cancellous bone scaffolds and to successfully contribute to regeneration of large bone defects in vivo. Conclusions. This study represents proof of principle for the direct use of enriched populations of cells with stem/progenitor identity for therapeutic applications.

Despite numerous ongoing clinical trials attempting to replace ailing IVD cells with mesenchymal stem cells, a solid understanding of the identity and nature of cells in a healthy mature IVD is still in need of refinement. Although anatomically simple, the IVD is comprised of heterogeneous cell populations. Therefore, methods involving cell pooling for RNA profiling could be misleading. Here, by using RNA in situ hybridization and z proportion test, we have identified potential novel biomarkers through single cell assessment. We quantified the proportion of RNA transcribing cells for 50 genetic loci in the outer annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) in coccygeal bovine discs isolated from tails of four skeletally mature animals. Our data reconfirm existing data and suggest 10 novel markers such as Lam1 and Thy1 in the outer AF and Gli1, Gli3, Noto, Scx, Ptprc, Sox2, Zscan10 and LOC101904175 in the NP, including pluripotency markers, that indicate stemness potential of IVD cells. These markers could be added to existing biomarker panels for cell type characterization. Furthermore, our data once more demonstrate heterogeneity in cells of the AF and NP, indicating the need for single cell assessment by methods such as RNA in situ hybridization. Our work refines the molecular identity of outer AF and NP cells, which can benefit future regenerative medicine and tissue engineering strategies in humans.

Here, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 4113 individual cells from human fetal pituitaries. We characterize divergent developmental trajectories with distinct transitional intermediate states in five hormone-producing cell lineages. Corticotropes exhibit an early intermediate state prior to full differentiation. Three cell types of the PIT-1 lineage (somatotropes, lactotropes and thyrotropes) segregate from a common progenitor coexpressing lineage-specific transcription factors of different sublineages. Gonadotropes experience two multistep developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we identify a fetal gonadotrope cell subtype expressing the primate-specific hormone chorionic gonadotropin. We also characterize the cellular heterogeneity of pituitary stem cells and identify a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state and an early-to-late state transition. Here, our results provide insights into the transcriptional landscape of human pituitary development, defining distinct cell substates and subtypes and illustrating transcription factor dynamics during cell fate commitment. Editor's summary_NCOMMS-19-41732B The anterior pituitary gland controls body growth and reproduction but how early development is dynamically regulated is unclear. Here, the authors use scRNA-seq of human fetal pituitaries to identify different developmental routes and state transitions of five hormone-producing cell lineages, and a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state of pituitary stem cells.

Redox-Active Mn Porphyrin-based Potent SOD Mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, Enhances Carbenoxolone-Mediated TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Multiforme	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS												Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant tumor of the brain and is challenging to treat due to its highly invasive nature and heterogeneity. Malignant brain tumor displays high metabolic activity which perturbs its redox environment and in turn translates to high oxidative stress. Thus, pushing the oxidative stress level to achieve the maximum tolerable threshold that induces cell death is a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Previously, we have shown that gap junction inhibitor, carbenoxolone (CBX), is capable of enhancing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis in glioma cells. Since CBX is known to induce oxidative stress, we hypothesized that the addition of another potent mediator of oxidative stress, powerful SODmimicMnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (MnBuOE), could further enhance TRAIL-driven therapeutic efficacy in glioma cells. Our results showed that combining TRAIL + CBX with MnBuOE significantly enhances cell death of glioma cell lines and this enhancement could be further potentiated by CBX pretreatment. MnBuOE-driven cytotoxicity is due to its ability to take advantage of oxidative stress imposed by CBX + TRAIL system, and enhance it in the presence of endogenous reductants, ascorbate and thiol, thereby producing cytotoxic H2O2, and in turn inducing death of glioma cells but not normal astrocytes. Most importantly, combination treatment significantly reduces viability of TRAIL-resistant Asian patient-derived glioma cells, thus demonstrating the potential clinical use of our therapeutic system. It was reported that H2O2 is involved in membrane depolarization-based sensitization of cancer cells toward TRAIL. MnBuOE is entering Clinical Trials as a normal brain radioprotector in glioma patients at Duke University increasing Clinical relevance of our studies.

Mapping the structure and biological functions within mesenchymal bodies using microfluidics	SCIENCE ADVANCES												Organoids that recapitulate the functional hallmarks of anatomic structures comprise cell populations able to self-organize cohesively in 3D. However, the rules underlying organoid formation in vitro remain poorly understood because a correlative analysis of individual cell fate and spatial organization has been challenging. Here, we use a novel microfluidics platform to investigate the mechanisms determining the formation of organoids by human mesenchymal stromal cells that recapitulate the early steps of condensation initiating bone repair in vivo. We find that heterogeneous mesenchymal stromal cells self-organize in 3D in a developmentally hierarchical manner. We demonstrate a link between structural organization and local regulation of specific molecular signaling pathways such as NF-kappa B and actin polymerization, which modulate osteo-endocrine functions. This study emphasizes the importance of resolving spatial heterogeneities within cellular aggregates to link organization and functional properties, enabling a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling organoid formation, relevant to organogenesis and tissue repair.

Uveal Melanoma Cell Lines Contain Stem-Like Cells That Self-Renew, Produce Differentiated Progeny, and Survive Chemotherapy	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE												PURPOSE. Uveal melanoma (UM) cells in high-metastatic risk tumors have an undifferentiated molecular signature indicative of a more primitive cellular phenotype. Given mounting evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC), the authors investigated whether UM cell lines retain a population of self-renewing tumorigenic cells. METHODS. Single-cell cloning and spheroid culture studies were used to study the presence of a CSC-like population in two cell lines derived from the primary tumor (Mel270) and metastatic liver lesion (Omm2.5) of the same patient. RESULTS. Mel270 and Omm2.5 cells exhibited distinct clonal morphologies in adherent culture akin to holoclones, meroclones, and paraclones. Holoclones were large colonies of tightly packed small cells, which could be serially passaged (> 10 generations) to produce colonies of all three types; paraclones were small colonies of flattened cells that could be passaged for only one or two generations to produce further paraclones. Mel270 and Omm2.5 cells surviving cisplatin treatment produced significantly more holoclones than untreated cells (P < 0.05), suggesting enrichment for this CSC-like subpopulation. Mel270 and Omm2.5 cells also formed melanomaspheres (MS) when grown at clonal density in nonadherent culture. MS possessed self-renewal capacity to generate further MS and when replated to adherent culture yielded colonies of all three types. Mel270 and Omm2.5 holoclones and MS also demonstrated antigenic heterogeneity expressing markers associated with both a primitive migratory neural crest phenotype, and a more differentiated phenotype. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest the presence in UM cell lines, of a CSC-like subpopulation with enhanced self-renewal and proliferative capabilities that could more appropriately model therapeutic efficacy.

Recently, lung resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) have been identified as an important contributor to myofibroblast activation in pulmonary fibrosis. Macrophages are also believed to play a critical role in pulmonary fibrosis. However, the underlying connections between LR-MSCs and macrophages in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis are still elusive.MethodsIn this study, we investigated the interaction between LR-MSCs and macrophages using a bleomycin-induced mouse pulmonary fibrosis model and a coculture system.ResultsHere, we show that blocking pulmonary macrophage infiltration attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, as determined by flow cytometry, we discovered that the recruited macrophages in fibrotic lungs of bleomycin-treated mice were mainly M2 macrophages. In particular, we found that M2, rather than M1 macrophages, promoted myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs. Moreover, we demonstrated that suppression of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway could attenuate myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs induced by M2 macrophages and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Tissue samples from IPF patients confirmed the infiltration of M2 macrophages and activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway.ConclusionIn summary, this study furthered our understanding of the pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis and highlighted M2 macrophages as a critical target for treating pulmonary fibrosis.

Lung Bone Marrow-derived Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells Enhance Pulmonary Fibrosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE												Rationale: Bone marrow (BM)-derived cells have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis. However, their precise role in pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Objectives: To elucidate roles of BM-derived cells in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and clarify their potential relationship to lung hematopoietic progenitor cells (LHPCs). Methods: GFP BM-chimera mice treated with or without bleomycin were used to assess the BM-derived cells. Measurements and Main Results: GFP(+) cells in the chimera lung were found to be comprised of two distinct phenotypes: GFP(hi) and GFP(low) cells. The GFP(hi), but not GFP(low), population was significantly increased after bleomycin treatment. Flow-cytometric analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that GFP(hi) cells exhibited phenotypic characteristics of CD11c(+) dendritic cells and macrophages. GFP(hi) cell conditioned media were chemotactic for fibroblasts obtained from fibrotic but not normal lung in vitro. Moreover, adoptive transfer of GFP(hi) cells exacerbated fibrosis in recipient mice, similar to that seen on adoptive transfer of BM-derived CD11c(+) cells from donor bleomycin-treated mice. Next, we evaluated the potential of LHPCs as the source of GFP(hi) cells. Isolation of LHPCs by flow sorting revealed enrichment in cKit(+)/Sca1(-)/Lin(-) cells, most of which were GFP(+) indicating their BM origin. The number of LHPCs increased rapidly after bleomycin treatment. Furthermore, stem cell factor induced LHPC proliferation, whereas granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor induced differentiation to GFP(hi) cells. Conclusions: BM-derived LHPCs with a novel phenotype could differentiate into GFP(hi) cells, which enhanced pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting this mobilized LHPCs might represent a novel therapeutic approach in chronic fibrotic lung diseases.

A facile one-step functionalization of biodegradable PDLLA fibers using amphiphilic diblock copolymers is demonstrated here to systematically vary the fiber surface composition. The copolymers comprise a hydrophilic poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate] (POEGMA), poly[(2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine] (PMPC), or poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)] (PDMAEMA) block and a hydrophobic poly(l-lactide) (PLA) block. The block copolymer-modified fibers have increased surface hydrophilicity compared to that of PDLLA fibers. Mixtures of PLAPMPC and PLAPOEGMA copolymers are utilized to exploit microphase separation of the incompatible hydrophilic PMPC and POEGMA blocks at the fiber surface. Conjugation of an RGD cell-adhesive peptide to one hydrophilic block (POEGMA) using thiol-ene chemistry produces fibers with domains of cell-adhesive (POEGMA) and cell-inert (PMPC) sites, mimicking the adhesive properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hES-MPs) showed much better adhesion to the fibers with surface-adhesive heterogeneity compared to that to fibers with only adhesive or only inert surface chemistries.

Metastatic breast carcinomas display genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity	MODERN PATHOLOGY												Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare and aggressive histologic type of breast cancer, preferentially displaying a triple-negative phenotype. We sought to define the transcriptomic heterogeneity of metaplastic breast cancers on the basis of current gene expression microarray-based classifiers, and to determine whether these tumors display gene copy number profiles consistent with those of BRCA1-associated breast cancers. Twenty-eight consecutive triple-negative metaplastic breast carcinomas were reviewed, and the metaplastic component present in each frozen specimen was defined (ie, spindle cell, squamous, chondroid metaplasia). RNA and DNA extracted from frozen sections with tumor cell content >60% were subjected to gene expression (Illumina HumanHT-12 v4) and copy number profiling (Affymetrix SNP 6.0), respectively. Using the best practice PAM50/claudin-low microarray-based classifier, all metaplastic breast carcinomas with spindle cell metaplasia were of claudin-low subtype, whereas those with squamous or chondroid metaplasia were preferentially of basal-like subtype. Triple-negative breast cancer subtyping using a dedicated website (http://cbc.mc.vanderbilt.edurtnbc/) revealed that all metaplastic breast carcinomas with chondroid metaplasia were of mesenchymal-like subtype, spindle cell carcinomas preferentially of unstable or mesenchymal stem-like subtype, and those with squamous metaplasia were of multiple subtypes. None of the cases was classified as immunomodulatory or luminal androgen receptor subtype. Integrative clustering, combining gene expression and gene copy number data, revealed that metaplastic breast carcinomas with spindle cell and chondroid metaplasia were preferentially classified as of integrative clusters 4 and 9, respectively, whereas those with squamous metaplasia were classified into six different clusters. Eight of the 26 metaplastic breast cancers subjected to SNP6 analysis were classified as BRCA1-like. The diversity of histologic features of metaplastic breast carcinomas is reflected at the transcriptomic level, and an association between molecular subtypes and histology was observed. BRCA1-like genomic profiles were found only in a subset (31%) of metaplastic breast cancers, and were not associated with a specific molecular or histologic subtype.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) play multiple roles in tissue homeostasis by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Due to their pan-inhibitory properties against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), SLRPs are reported to exert anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo. However, their roles seem to be tissue-specific and they are also involved in cancer cell migration and drug resistance, paving the way to complex different scenarios. The aim of this study was to determine whether the SLRPs decorin (DCN) and lumican (LUM) are recruited in cell plasticity and microenvironmental adaptation of differentiated cancer cells induced towards stem-like phenotype. Floating neurospheres were generated by applying CSC enrichment medium (neural stem cell serum-free medium, NSC SFM) to the established SF-268 and SK-N-SH cancer cell lines, cellular models of GBM and NB, respectively. In both models, the time-dependent synergistic activation of DCN and LUM was observed. The highest DCN and LUM mRNA/protein expression was detected after cell exposure to NSC SFM for 8/12 days, considering these cells as SLRP-expressing (SLRP+) CSC-like. Ultrastructural imaging showed the cellular heterogeneity of both the GBM and NB neurospheres and identified the inner living cells. Parental cell lines of both GBM and NB grew only in soft agar + NSC SFM, whereas the secondary neurospheres (originated from SLRP+ t(8) CSC-like) showed lower proliferation rates than primary neurospheres. Interestingly, the SLRP+ CSC-like from the GBM and NB neurospheres were resistant to temozolomide (TMZ) at concentrations >750 mu M. Our results suggest that GBM and NB CSC-like promote the activation of huge quantities of SLRP in response to CSC enrichment, simultaneously acquiring TMZ resistance, cellular heterogeneity, and a quiescent phenotype, suggesting a novel pivotal role for SLRP in drug resistance and cell plasticity of CSC-like, allowing cell survival and ECM/niche modulation potential.

This process has been related to embryologic morphogenesis but also to cancer progression and metastasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate the expression of EMT-related markers in adherent and spheroid cell cultures derived from malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) of patients affected by lung adenocarcinoma. On the basis of efficient in vitro propagation, six cases of MPEs were selected and analyzed by immunocytochemistry staining for EMT markers and by RT-PCR for transcription factors known to orchestrate EMT. EMT markers immunostaining showed in spheroids a statistically significant correlation between the loss of E-cadherin immunoreactivity and overexpression of N-cadherin (P<0.001). Likewise loss of EpCAM epithelial marker was coincident with Vimentin overexpression (P<0.001). RT-PCR analysis of transcription factors Snail, Slug, and Twist showed a highly variable expression, although a general trend to increase was observed. Importantly, in some selected cases it was possible to establish a precise relationship between spheroid formation, EMT switch and increased upregulation of the marker related to cancer stemness such as ALDH positivity. Therefore, MPE-derived cell cultures, while recapitulating the heterogeneity of lung cancer, are a suitable system to study the mechanisms at the basis of EMT and to understand its relationship with the generation of cancer stem cells.

However, successful application in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has been very limited so far. High plasticity and heterogeneity of CTC morphology challenges currently available enrichment and detection techniques with EpCAM as the usual surface marker being underrepresented in mRCC. We recently described a method that enables us to identify and characterize non-hematopoietic cells in the peripheral blood stream with varying characteristics and define CTC subgroups that distinctly associate to clinical parameters. With this pilot study we wanted to scrutinize feasibility of this approach and its potential usage in clinical studies. Experimental Design Peripheral blood was drawn from 14 consecutive mRCC patients at the West German Cancer Center and CTC profiles were analyzed by Multi-Parameter Immunofluorescence Microscopy (MPIM). Additionally angiogenesis-related genes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Results We detected CTC with epithelial, mesenchymal, stem cell-like or mixed-cell characteristics at different time-points during anti-angiogenic therapy. The presence and quantity of N-cadherin-positive or CD133-positive CTC was associated with inferior PFS. There was an inverse correlation between high expression of HIF1A, VEGFA, VEGFR and FGFR and the presence of N-cadherin-positive and CD133-positive CTC. Conclusions Patients with mRCC exhibit distinct CTC profiles that may implicate differences in therapeutic outcome.

We used immortalized human BMSC clonal lines for multi-level analysis of functional markers for BMSC subsets. All clones expressed typical BMSC cell-surface antigens; however, clones with trilineage differentiation capacity exhibited enhanced vascular interaction gene sets, whereas non-differentiating clones were uniquely CD317 positive with significantly enriched immunomodulatory transcriptional networks and high IL-7 production. IL-7 lineage tracing and CD317 immunolocalization confirmed the existence of a rare non-differentiating BMSC subtype, distinct from Cxcl12-DsRed(+) perivascular stromal cells in vivo. Colony-forming CD317(+) IL-7(hi) cells, identified at similar to 1%-3% frequency in heterogeneous human BMSC fractions, were found to have the same biomolecular profile as non-differentiating BMSC clones using Raman spectroscopy. Distinct functional identities can be assigned to BMSC subpopulations, which are likely to have specific roles in immune control, lymphopoiesis, and bone homeostasis.				de Almeida Rocha Ponzoni, Raquel/ABA-8167-2021	de Almeida Rocha Ponzoni, Raquel/0000-0002-5752-5006; Preham, Olivier/0000-0001-8795-1391; Fox, James/0000-0002-2473-7029; Genever, Paul/0000-0002-5730-8976; Afsari, Farinaz/0000-0002-1528-0346												2213-6711					JUN 9	2015	4	6					1004	1015		10.1016/j.stemcr.2015.05.005							WOS:000356068100008	26070611

Here, we dissect mechanisms controlling intratumoral heterogeneity within triple-negative basal-like breast cancers. Tumor cells expressing the cytokeratin K14 possess a differentiation state that is associated with that of normal luminal progenitors, and K14-negative cells are in a state closer to that of mature luminal cells. We show that cells can transition between these states through asymmetric divisions, which produce one K14(+) and one K14(-) daughter cell, and that these asymmetric divisions contribute to the generation of cellular heterogeneity. We identified several regulators that control the proportion of K14(+) cells in the population. EZH2 and Notch increase the numbers of K14(+) cells and their rates of symmetric divisions, and FOXA1 has an opposing effect. Our findings demonstrate that asymmetric divisions generate differentiation transitions and heterogeneity, and identify pathways that control breast cancer cellular composition.

It has been proposed that the treatment resistance and heterogeneity of CSCs are deeply involved in the prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The objective of this study was to identify the influence of the expression status of the CSC markers CD44 and CD133 on chemotherapeutic efficacy and prognosis in ESCC patients who underwent radical esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Endoscopically biopsied specimens taken before NAC and surgically resected specimens after NAC were immunohistochemically assessed for CD44 and CD133 expression for 47 ESCC patients who underwent NAC followed by radical esophagectomy. The correlation between CD44 and CD133 expression status and clinicopathological findings and the prognosis of ESCC patients after NAC followed by esophagectomy were analyzed. The percentages of CD44-positive cells and CD133-positive cells in specimens were increased after NAC. CD44 and CD133 expression status before NAC did not correlate with the degree of tumor progression and had no impact on the chemotherapeutic effect. However, strong expression of CD44 or CD133 and a high proportion of CD133-expressing cells before NAC were significantly associated with poorer esophageal cancer-specific survival. Patients with strong expression of CD44 or CD133 and those with a high ratio of CD133-positive tumor cells showed significantly poor prognosis regardless of the effect of chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that simultaneous strong expression of CD44 and CD133 before NAC, a high rate of CD133-positive tumor cells before NAC, and primary tumor remission assessed by preoperative endoscopy were significant independent prognostic factors for ESCC. Our data indicate that CD44 and CD133 expression status prior to treatment dictates the malignant potential of ESCC and may be a novel predictor of recurrence and prognosis of ESCC patients after treatment.

BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Background: Mammary cell cultures are convenient tools for in vitro studies of mammary gland biology. However, the heterogeneity of mammary cell types, e.g., glandular milk secretory epithelial or myoepithelial cells, often complicates the interpretation of cell-based data. The present study was undertaken to determine the relevance of bovine primary mammary epithelial cells isolated from American Holstein (bMEC(US)) or Swiss Holstein-Friesian (bMEC(CH)) cows, and of primary bovine mammary alveolar epithelial cells stably transfected with simian virus-40 (SV-40) large T-antigen (MAC-T) for in vitro analyses. This was evaluated by testing their expression pattern of cytokeratin (CK) 7, 18, 19, vimentin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Results: The expression of the listed markers was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Characteristic markers of the mesenchymal (vimentin), myoepithelial (alpha-SMA) and glandular secretory cells (CKs) showed differential expression among the studied cell cultures, partly depending on the analytical method used. The relative mRNA expression of vimentin, CK7 and CK19, respectively, was lower (P < 0.05) in immortalized than in primary mammary cell cultures. The stain index (based on flow cytometry) of CK7 and CK19 protein was lower (P < 0.05) in MAC-T than in bMECs, while the expression of alpha-SMA and CK18 showed an inverse pattern. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis mostly confirmed the mRNA data, while partly disagreed with flow cytometry data (e.g., vimentin level in MAC-T). The differential expression of CK7 and CK19 allowed discriminating between immortal and primary mammary cultures. Conclusions: The expression of the selected widely used cell type markers in primary and immortalized MEC cells did not allow a clear preference between these two cell models for in vitro analyses studying aspects of milk composition. All tested cell models exhibited to a variable degree epithelial and mesenchymal features. Thus, based on their characterization with widely used cell markers, none of these cultures represent an unequivocal alveolar mammary epithelial cell model. For choosing the appropriate in vitro model additional properties such as the expression profile of specific proteins of interest (e.g., transporter proteins) should equally be taken into account.

Recent development of massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful method to resolve the cellular heterogeneity from gene expression and pathway regulation analysis. However, the scarcity of CTCs and the massive contamination of blood cells limit the utility of currently available technologies. Here, we present Hydro-Seq, a scalable hydrodynamic scRNA-seq barcoding technique, for high-throughput CTC analysis. High cell-capture efficiency and contamination removal capability of Hydro-Seq enables successful scRNA-seq of 666 CTCs from 21 breast cancer patient samples at high throughput. We identify breast cancer drug targets for hormone and targeted therapies and tracked individual cells that express markers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as well as of epithelial/mesenchymal cell state transitions. Transcriptome analysis of these cells provides insights into monitoring target therapeutics and processes underlying tumor metastasis.

Tumor-initiating cells (TICs or cancer stem cells) and cells showing epithelial-mesenchymal- transition (EMT) are particularly implicated. Spontaneous spherical cell aggregates are sometimes observed, but although similar to those formed by TICs in vitro, their significance is unclear. Methods: Cells freshly isolated from malignant ascites were separated into sphere samples (S-type samples, n=9) and monolayer-forming single-cell suspensions (M-type, n=18). Using western blot, these were then compared for expression of protein markers of EMT, TIC, and of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Results: S-type cells differed significantly from M-type by expressing high levels of E-cadherin and no or little vimentin, integrin-beta 3 or stem cell transcription factor Oct-4A. By contrast, M-type samples were enriched for CD44, Oct-4A and for CAF markers. Independently of M- and S-type, there was a strong correlation between TIC markers Nanog and EpCAM. The CAF marker alpha-SMA correlated with clinical stage IV. This is the first report on CAF markers in malignant ascites and on SUMOylation of Oct-4A in ovarian cancer. Conclusions: In addition to demonstrating potentially high levels of TICs in ascites, the results suggest that the S-type population is the less tumorigenic one. Nanog(high)/EpCAM(high) samples represent a TIC subset which may be either M- or S-type, and which is separate from the CD44(high)/Oct-4A(high) subset observed only in M- type samples. This demonstrates a heterogeneity in TIC populations in vivo which has practical implications for TIC isolation based on cell sorting. The biological heterogeneity will need to be addressed in future therapeutical strategies.

Bos taurus and human IVDs are histologically more similar than is Mus musculus. The mature bovine IVD is well suited as model system for technology development to be translated into therapeutic cell based regenerative medicine applications. We present a reproducible non-enzymatic protocol to isolate cell progenitor populations of three distinct areas of the mature bovine IVD. Bovine specific RNA probes were validated in situ and employed to assess fate changes, heterogeneity, stem cell characteristics and differentiation potential of the cultures. Quality control measures with single cell resolution like RNA in situ hybridization to assess culture heterogeneity (PISH) followed by optimization of culture conditions could be translated to human ND cell culture to increase the safety of cell based regenerative medicine.

Colorectal cancer derived organotypic spheroids maintain essential tissue characteristics but adapt their metabolism in culture	PROTEOME SCIENCE												Background: Organotypic tumor spheroids, a 3D in vitro model derived from patient tumor material, preserve tissue heterogeneity and retain structural tissue elements, thus replicating the in vivo tumor more closely than commonly used 2D and 3D cell line models. Such structures harbour tumorigenic cells, as revealed by xenograft implantation studies in animal models and maintain the genetic makeup of the original tumor material. The aim of our work was a morphological and proteomic characterization of organotypic spheroids derived from colorectal cancer tissue in order to get insight into their composition and associated biology. Results: Morphological analysis showed that spheroids were of about 250 m in size and varied in structure, while the spheroid cells differed in shape and size and were tightly packed together by desmosomes and tight junctions. Our proteomic data revealed significant alterations in protein expression in organotypic tumor spheroids cultured as primary explants compared to primary colorectal cancer tissue. Components underlying cellular and tissue architecture were changed; nuclear DNA/chromatin maintenance systems were up-regulated, whereas various mitochondrial components were down-regulated in spheroids. Most interestingly, the mesenchymal cells appear to be substantial component in such cellular assemblies. Thus the observed changes may partly occur in this cellular compartment. Finally, in the proteomics analysis stem cell-like characteristics were observed within the spheroid cellular assembly, reflected by accumulation of Alcam, Ctnnb1, Aldh1, Gpx2, and CD166. These findings were underlined by IHC analysis of Ctnnb1, CD24 and CD44, therefore warranting closer investigation of the tumorigenic compartment in this 3D culture model for tumor tissue. Conclusions: Our analysis of organotypic CRC tumor spheroids has identified biological processes associated with a mixture of cell types and states, including protein markers for mesenchymal and stem-like cells. This 3D tumor model in which tumor heterogeneity is preserved may represent an advantageous model system to investigate novel therapeutic approaches.

Lineage dynamics of murine pancreatic development at single-cell resolution	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Organogenesis requires the complex interactions of multiple cell lineages that coordinate their expansion, differentiation, and maturation over time. Here, we profile the cell types within the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the murine pancreas across developmental time using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and genetic lineage tracing. We identify previously underappreciated cellular heterogeneity of the developing mesenchyme and reconstruct potential lineage relationships among the pancreatic mesothelium and mesenchymal cell types. Within the epithelium, we find a previously undescribed endocrine progenitor population, as well as an analogous population in both human fetal tissue and human embryonic stem cells differentiating toward a pancreatic beta cell fate. Further, we identify candidate transcriptional regulators along the differentiation trajectory of this population toward the alpha or beta cell lineages. This work establishes a roadmap of pancreatic development and demonstrates the broad utility of this approach for understanding lineage dynamics in developing organs.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) domain serves as a druggable target in NSCLC patients with exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. However, patients eventually succumbed to resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TK inhibitors through activation of T790M mutation. Third-generation EGFR-TKI, Osimertinib exhibits high efficacy in patients with exon 19 deletion/L858R/T790M mutation but they experienced acquired resistance thereafter. Available treatment options in NSCLC patients remains a challenge due to unknown molecular heterogeneity responsible for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. In this study, we aim to generate Osimertinib-resistant (OR) cells from H1975 carrying L858R/T790M double mutation which can be used as a model to elucidate mechanism of resistance. Methods: OR cells were established via stepwise-dose escalation and limiting single-cell dilution method. We then evaluated Osimertinib resistance potential via cell viability assay. Proteins expression related to EGFR-signalling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and autophagy were analyzed via western blot. Results: OR cell lines exhibited increased drug resistance potential compared to H1975. Distinguishable mesenchymal-like features were observed in OR cells. Protein expression analysis revealed EGFR-independent signaling involved in the derived OR cells as well as EMT and autophagy activity. Conclusion: We generated OR cell lines in-vitro as evidenced by increased drug resistance potential, increased mesenchymal features, and enhanced autophagy activity. Development of Osimertinib resistance cells may serve as in-vitro model facilitating discovery of molecular aberration present during acquired mechanism of resistance.																	1726-4901	1728-7731				MAR	2021	84	3					248	254		10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000438							WOS:000639296700003	33009209

Long-term efficiency of mesenchymal stromal cell-mediated CD-MSC/5FC therapy in human melanoma xenograft model	GENE THERAPY												Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can be exploited as cellular delivery vehicles for the enzymes converting non-toxic prodrugs to toxic substances. Because of their inherent chemoresistance, they exert potent bystander and antitumor effect. Here we show that the human adipose tissue-derived MSC expressing fusion yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD-MSC) in combination with 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) mediated a long-term tumor-free survival in the 83.3% of tumor-bearing animals. CD-MSC/5FC treatment induced cytotoxicity against model human melanoma cells EGFP-A375. Only 4% of the therapeutic CD-MSC cells eliminated > 98.5% of the tumor cells in vitro. Long-term tumor-free survival was confirmed in 15 out of the 18 animals. However, repeatedly used CD-MSC/5FC therapeutic regimen generated more aggressive and metastatic variant of the melanoma cells EGFP-A375/Rel3. These cells derived from the refractory xenotransplants exhibited increased resistance to the CD-MSC/5FC treatment, altered cell adhesion, migration, tumorigenic and metastatic properties. However, long-term curative effect was achieved by the augmentation of the CD-MSC/5FC regimen along with the inhibition of c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor signaling axis in this aggressive melanoma derivative. In summary, the CD-MSC/5FC regimen can be regarded as a very effective antitumor approach to achieve long-term tumor-free survival as demonstrated on a mouse model of aggressive human melanoma xenografts.

In this study, we aimed to characterize pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells showing epithelial or mesenchymal features in 3D culture. In 3D culture, PK-1 cells had high E-cadherin and low vimentin expression and exhibited a round-like appearance encircled by flat cells. PANC-1 cells had high vimentin and low E-cadherin expression and formed grape-like spheres. PK-1 cells had secretary granules and many microvilli, desmosomes, and adherens junctions, while PANC-1 cells had few microvilli, adherens junction, and no desmosomes. Cytokeratin 7, trypsin, CA19-9, and E-cadherin were highly expressed in PK-1 cells but not in PANC-1 cells. Ki-67 was diffusely expressed in PANC-1 spheres but was restricted to the peripheral flat cells of PK-1 spheres. PANC-1 and PK-1 cells were positive for transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptor II and phosphorylated smad2/3, but PK-1 cells were smad4 negative. Taken together, 3D culture enhanced morphofunctional differences of PDAC cells showing epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics, and epithelial phenotype maintenance may be due to the ineffectiveness of the TGF-beta pathway. Clarification of heterogeneity using 3D culture may be useful for development of individualized diagnostic and therapeutic methods in patients with PDAC.

In addition, the current advancements in tissue-engineered skin constructs and stem cell-based therapies are facing significant hurdles due to the absence of a renewable source of functional cells. Recent Advances: Induced pluripotent stem cell technology (iPSC) is emerging as a novel tool to develop the next generation of personalized medicine for the treatment of chronic wounds. The iPSC provides unlimited access to various skin cells to generate complex personalized three-dimensional skin constructs for disease modeling and autologous grafts. Furthermore, the iPSC-based therapies can target distinct wound healing phases and have shown accelerating wound closure by enhancing angiogenesis, cell migration, tissue regeneration, and modulating inflammation. Critical Issues: Since the last decade, iPSC has been revolutionizing the field of wound healing and skin tissue engineering. Despite the current progress, safety and heterogeneity among iPSC lines are still major hurdles in addition to the lack of large animal studies. These challenges need to be addressed before translating an iPSC-based therapy to the clinic. Future Directions: Future considerations should be given to performing large animal studies to check the safety and efficiency of iPSC-based therapy in a wound healing setup. Furthermore, strategies should be developed to overcome variation between hiPSC lines, develop an efficient manufacturing process for iPSC-derived products, and generate complex skin constructs with vasculature and skin appendages.

As current standard therapy consisting of surgery and chemo-irradiation provides limited benefit for GBM patients, novel therapeutic options are urgently required. Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor is an oncogenic regulator that promotes the proliferation, survival, and treatment resistance of various human cancers. The roles of FoxM1 in GBM remain incompletely understood, due in part to pleotropic nature of the FoxM1 pathway. Here, we show the roles of FoxM1 in GBM stem cell maintenance and radioresistance. ShRNA-mediated FoxM1 inhibition significantly impeded clonogenic growth and survival of patient-derived primary GBM cells with marked downregulation of Sox2, a master regulator of stem cell phenotype. Ectopic expression of Sox2 partially rescued FoxM1 inhibition-mediated effects. Conversely, FoxM1 overexpression upregulated Sox2 expression and promoted clonogenic growth of GBM cells. These data, with a direct binding of FoxM1 in the Sox2 promoter region in GBM cells, suggest that FoxM1 regulates stemness of primary GBM cells via Sox2. We also found significant increases in FoxM1 and Sox2 expression in GBM cells after irradiation both in vitro and in vivo orthotopic tumor models. Notably, genetic or a small-molecule FoxM1 inhibitor-mediated FoxM1 targeting significantly sensitized GBM cells to irradiation, accompanying with Sox2 downregulation. Finally, FoxM1 inhibition combined with irradiation in a patient GBM-derived orthotopic model significantly impeded tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor bearing mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the FoxM1-Sox2 signaling axis promotes clonogenic growth and radiation resistance of GBM, and suggest that FoxM1 targeting combined with irradiation is a potentially effective therapeutic approach for GBM.																	1932-6203					OCT 7	2015	10	10							e0137703	10.1371/journal.pone.0137703							WOS:000362510600013	26444992

Tumorigenic WAP-T Mouse Mammary Carcinoma Cells: A Model for a Self-Reproducing Homeostatic Cancer Cell System	PLOS ONE												Background: In analogy to normal stem cell differentiation, the current cancer stem cell (CSC) model presumes a hierarchical organization and an irreversible differentiation in tumor tissue. Accordingly, CSCs should comprise only a small subset of the tumor cells, which feeds tumor growth. However, some recent findings raised doubts on the general applicability of the CSC model and asked for its refinement. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we analyzed the CSC properties of mammary carcinoma cells derived from transgenic (WAP-T) mice. We established a highly tumorigenic WAP-T cell line (G-2 cells) that displays stem-like traits. G-2 cells, as well as their clonal derivates, are closely related to primary tumors regarding histology and gene expression profiles, and reflect heterogeneity regarding their differentiation states. G-2 cultures comprise cell populations in distinct differentiation states identified by co-expression of cytoskeletal proteins (cytokeratins and vimentin), a combination of cell surface markers and a set of transcription factors. Cellular subsets sorted according to expression of CD24a, CD49f, CD61, Epcam, Sca1, and Thy1 cell surface proteins, or metabolic markers (e.g. ALDH activity) are competent to reconstitute the initial cellular composition. Repopulation efficiency greatly varies between individual subsets and is influenced by interactions with the respective complementary G-2 cellular subset. The balance between differentiation states is regulated in part by the transcription factor Sox10, as depletion of Sox10 led to up-regulation of Twist2 and increased the proportion of Thy1-expressing cells representing cells in a self-renewable, reversible, quasi-mesenchymal differentiation state. Conclusions/Significance: G-2 cells constitute a self-reproducing cancer cell system, maintained by bi- and unidirectional conversion of complementary cellular subsets. Our work contributes to the current controversial discussion on the existence and nature of CSC and provides a basis for the incorporation of alternative hypotheses into the CSC model.																	1932-6203					AUG 11	2010	5	8							e12103	10.1371/journal.pone.0012103							WOS:000280849100025	20730114

Current protocols for MSC isolation from bone marrow (BM) rely on density gradient centrifugation (DGC), and the production of sufficient MSC doses is a critical factor for conducting clinical MSC trials. Previously, a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compatible non-woven fabric filter device system to isolate MSCs was developed to increase the MSC yield from the BM. The aim of our study was to compare high-resolution phenotypic and functional characteristics of BM-MSCs isolated with this device and with standard DGC technology. Methods Human BM samples from 5 donors were analyzed. Each sample was divided equally, processing by DGC, and with the filter device. Stem cell content was assessed by quantification of colony-forming units fibroblasts (CFU-F). Immunophenotype was analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. In vitro trilineage differentiation potential, trophic factors, and IDO-1 production were assessed. Functionally, immunomodulatory potential, wound healing, and angiogenesis were assayed in vitro. Results The CFU-F yield was 15-fold higher in the MSC preparations isolated with the device compared to those isolated by DGC. Consequently, the MSC yield that could be manufactured at passage 3 per mL collected BM was more than 10 times higher in the device group compared to DGC (1.65 x 10(9) vs. 1.45 x 10(8)). The immunomodulatory potential and IDO-1 production showed donor-to-donor variabilities without differences between fabric filter-isolated and DGC-isolated MSCs. The results from the wound closure assays, the tube formation assays, and the trilineage differentiation assays were similar between the groups with respect to the isolation method. Sixty-four MSC subpopulations could be quantified with CD140a(+)CD119(+)CD146(+) as most common phenotype group, and CD140a(+)CD119(+)CD146(+)MSCA-1(-)CD106(-)CD271(-) and CD140a(+)CD119(+)CD146(-)MSCA-1(-)CD106(-)CD271(-) as most frequent MSC subpopulations. As trophic factors hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, angiopoietin-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A could be detected in both groups with considerable variability between donors, but independent of the respective MSC isolation technique. Conclusion The isolation of MSCs using a GMP-compatible fabric filter system device resulted in higher yield of CFU-F, producing substantially more MSCs with similar subpopulation composition and functional characteristics as MSCs isolated by DGC.																	2296-634X					MAR 29	2021	9								638798	10.3389/fcell.2021.638798							WOS:000639140800001	33869188

It has been shown that human cardiac mesenchymal progenitor cells (CMPCs) can be differentiated into endothelial, smooth muscle, and fibroblast cells. Here, we have investigated, for the first time, the contribution of CMPCs in the fibrotic process occurring in AF. As expected, right auricolae samples displayed significantly higher fibrosis in AF vs control (CTR) patients. In tissue samples of AF patients only, double staining for c-kit and the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was detected. The number of c-kit-positive CMPC was higher in atrial subepicardial regions of CTR than AF cells. AF-derived CMPC (AF-CMPC) and CTR-derived CMPC (Ctr-CMPC) were phenotypically similar, except for CD90 and c-kit, which were significantly more present in AF and CTR cells, respectively. Moreover, AF showed a lower rate of population doubling and fold enrichment vs Ctr-CMPC. When exogenously challenged with the profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), AF-CMPC showed a significantly higher nuclear translocation of SMAD2 than Ctr-CMPC. In addition, TGF-beta 1 treatment induced the upregulation of COLIA1 and COLIA2 in AF-CMPC only. Further, both a marked production of soluble collagen and alpha-SMA upregulation have been observed in AF-CMPC only. Finally, electrophysiological studies showed that the inwardly rectifying potassium current (I-K1) was evenly present in AF- and Ctr-CMPC in basal conditions and similarly disappeared after TGF-beta 1 exposure. All together, these data suggest that AF steers the resident atrial CMPC compartment toward an electrically inert profibrotic phenotype.

Here, 226 blood samples from 92 patients with breast cancer, including patients with newly diagnosed or metastatic refractory cancer, and 16 blood samples from healthy subjects were cultured in laser-ablated microwells. Clusters containing an increasing number of cytokeratin-positive (CK+) cells appeared after 2 weeks, while most blood cells disappeared with time. Cultures were heterogeneous and exhibited two distinct sub-populations of cells: 'Small' (<= 25 mu m; high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio; CD45-) cells, comprising CTCs, and 'Large' (> 25 mu m; low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio; CD68+ or CD56+) cells, corresponding to macrophage and natural killer-like cells. The Small cell fraction also showed copy number increases in six target genes (FGFR1, Myc, CCND1, HER2, TOP2A and ZNF217) associated with breast cancer. These expanded CTCs exhibited different proportions of epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes and were transferable for further expansion as spheroids in serum-free suspension or 3D cultures. Cluster formation was affected by the presence and duration of systemic therapy, and its persistence may reflect therapeutic resistance. This novel and advanced method estimates CTC clonal heterogeneity and can predict, within a relatively short time frame, patient responses to therapy.

In our previous study we demonstrated that stimulation of TNBC and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) co-cultures by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) has led to increased metastasis-related properties in vitro and in vivo. In this context, elevated release of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL5 (RANTES) was noted in TNF alpha- and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta)-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures; the process was partly (CXCL8) and entirely (CCL5) dependent on physical contacts between the two cell types. Here, we demonstrate that DAPT, inhibitor of gamma-secretase that participates in activation of Notch receptors, inhibited the migration and invasion of TNBC cells that were grown in "Contact" co-cultures with MSCs or with patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in the presence of TNF alpha. DAPT also inhibited the contact-dependent induction of CXCL8, but not of CCL5, in TNF alpha- and IL-1 beta-stimulated TNBC:MSC/CAF co-cultures; some level of heterogeneity between the responses of different TNBC cell lines was noted, with MDA-MB-231:MSC/CAF co-cultures being the most sensitive to DAPT. Patient dataset studies comparing basal tumors to luminal-A tumors, and mRNA analyses of Notch receptors in TNBC and luminal-A cells pointed at Notch1 as possible mediator of CXCL8 increase in TNF alpha-stimulated TNBC:stroma "Contact" co-cultures. Accordingly, down-regulation of Notch1 in TNBC cells by siRNA has substantially reduced the contact-dependent elevation in CXCL8 in TNF alpha- and also in IL-1 beta-stimulated TNBC:MSC "Contact" co-cultures. Then, studies in which CXCL8 or p65 (NF-kappa B pathway) were down-regulated (siRNAs; CRISPR/Cas9) in TNBC cells and/or MSCs, indicated that upon TNF alpha stimulation of "Contact" co-cultures, p65 was activated and led to CXCL8 production mainly in TNBC cells. Moreover, our findings indicated that when tumor cells interacted with stromal cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, TNF alpha-induced p65 activation has led to elevated Notch1 expression and activation, which then gave rise to elevated production of CXCL8. Overall, tumor:stroma interactions set the stage for Notch1 activation by pro-inflammatory signals, leading to CXCL8 induction and consequently to pro-metastatic activities. These observations may have important clinical implications in designing novel therapy combinations in TNBC.

Cancer stem cells are identified as one of the ways by which chemoresistance develops. METHOD: We investigated the anti-inflammatory combinatorial treatment (DA) of doxorubicin and aspirin using a preclinical microfluidic model on cancer cell lines and patient-derived circulating tumour cell clusters. The model had been previously demonstrated to predict patient overall prognosis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that low-dose aspirin with a sub-optimal dose of doxorubicin for 72 h could generate higher killing efficacy and enhanced apoptosis. Seven days of DA treatment significantly reduced the proportion of cancer stem cells and colonyforming ability. DA treatment delayed the inhibition of interleukin-6 secretion, which is mediated by both COX-dependent and independent pathways. The response of patients varied due to clinical heterogeneity, with 62.5% and 64.7% of samples demonstrating higher killing efficacy or reduction in cancer stem cell (CSC) proportions after DA treatment, respectively. These results highlight the importance of using patient-derived models for drug discovery. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical proof of concept seeks to reduce the onset of CSCs generated post treatment by stressful stimuli. Our study will promote a better understanding of anti-inflammatory treatments for cancer and reduce the risk of relapse in patients.

Here, we report that MAPK signaling shows strong intratumoral heterogeneity and unexpectedly remains regulated in colorectal cancer irrespective of KRAS mutation status. Using primary colorectal cancer tissues, xenograft models, and MAPK reporter constructs, we showed that tumor cells with high MAPK activity resided specifically at the leading tumor edge, ceased to proliferate, underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and expressed markers related to colon cancer stem cells. In KRAS-mutant colon cancer, regulation of MAPK signaling was preserved through remaining wild-type RAS isoforms. Moreover, using a lineage tracing strategy, we provide evidence that high MAPK activity marked a progenitor cell compartment of growth-fueling colon cancer cells in vivo. Our results imply that differential MAPK signaling balances EMT, cancer stem cell potential, and tumor growth in colorectal cancer.

Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of intratumoural heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is vital for the discovery of new therapeutic methods for improving the prognosis of patients. Of note, cancer stem cells (CSCs) existing in HCC may explain the pathological properties of heterogeneity and recurrence. An increasing number of studies have confirmed that abnormally expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) take part in the carcinogenesis as well as the aggravation of HCC. However, little information is currently available about the specific miR-4319 in HCC. Herein, we demonstrated that the level of miR-4319 was remarkably decreased in HCC specimens and cells compared to that in normal counterparts and that the depression of miR-4319 in tumour specimens correlates with tumour size, histological grade and venous invasion. Through a series of functional experiments, we illustrated that miR-4319 repressed cell proliferation, accelerated apoptosis, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and prevented cancer stemness in HCC cells by targeting FOXQ1 (Forkhead box Q1). An in vivo tumourigenesis assay uncovered that depletion of miR-4319 in Hep3B cells increased tumour growth and elevated the expression of EMT and CSC markers in comparison to those of the control group. Restoration of FOXQ1 expression also partially reversed the miR-4319-induced biological effects on HCC cells. Thus, miR-4319, as a posttranscriptional regulator, plays a profound role in suppressing the malignant progression of HCC, and our study highlights the miR-4319/FOXQ1 cascade as a potential therapeutic target for conquering HCC.																	1449-2288						2019	15	13					2936	2947		10.7150/ijbs.38000							WOS:000496826300014	31853229

Recent evidence indicates that tumors contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are responsible for tumor maintenance and spread. CSCs have recently been linked to the occurrence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Neurotrophins (NTs) are growth factors that regulate the biology of embryonic stem cells and cancer cells, but still little is known about the role NTs in the progression of lung cancer. In this work, we investigated the role of the NTs and their receptors using as a study system primary cell cultures derived from malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) of patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. We assessed the expression of NTs and their receptors in MPE-derived adherent cultures vs. spheroids enriched in CSC markers. We observed in spheroids a selectively enhanced expression of trkB, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Both K252a, a known inhibitor of Trk activity, and a siRNA against trkB strongly affected spheroid morphology, induced anoikis and decreased spheroid forming efficiency. treatment with neurotrophins reversed the inhibitory effect of K252a. Importantly, TrkB inhibition caused loss of vimentin expression as well as that of a set of transcription factors known to be linked to EMT. these ex vivo results nicely correlated with an inverse relationship between TrkB and E-cadherin expression measured by immunohistochemistry in a panel of lung adenocarcinoma samples. We conclude that TrkB is involved in full acquisition of EMT in lung cancer, and that its inhibition results in a less aggressive phenotype.

To understand the cellular interactions and molecules that provide these functions, investigators have previously established stromal cell lines from the late gestational stage and adult murine hematopoietic microenvironments. However, the stromal cell microenvironment that supports the emergence, expansion and maintenance of HSCs during mid-gestational stages has been largely unexplored. Since several tissues within the mouse embryo are known to harbor HSCs (i.e. aorta-gonads-mesonephros, yolk sac, liver), we generated numerous stromal cell clones from these mid-gestational sites. Owing to the limited cell numbers, isolations were performed with tissues from transgenic embryos containing the is SV40 Tag gene (tsA58) under the transcriptional control of constitutive and ubiquitously expressing promoters. We report here that the growth and cloning efficiency of embryonic cells (with the exception of the aorta) is increased in the presence of the tsA58 transgene. Furthermore, our results show that the large panel of stromal clones isolated from the different embryonal subregions exhibit heterogeneity in their ability to promote murine and human hematopoietic differentiation. Despite our findings of heterogeneity in hematopoietic growth factor gene expression profiles, high-level expression of some factors may influence hematopoietic differentiation. Interestingly, a few of these stromal clones express a recently described chordin-like protein, which is an inhibitor of bone morphogenic proteins and is preferentially expressed in cells of the mesenchymal lineage.

First, control knitting scaffolds were fabricated using 150-mu m-diameter PCL monofilaments. Using chloroform and NaOH, PCL knitting scaffolds with varying roughness, pore-size heterogeneity, and surface wettability were fabricated. Cell-culture assessments were performed on these six types of PCL knitting scaffolds. Saos-2 cells were used for cell assessments and cultured for 14 days on each scaffold. Consequently, heterogeneous pore-size distribution and high surface wettability were found to enhance cell proliferation in knitting scaffolds. In addition, for highly hydrophobic knitting scaffolds exhibiting water contact angles greater than 110 degrees, smaller surface roughness was found to enhance cell proliferation. According to this study, in the case of knitting scaffold, NaOH-treated knitting scaffold, without any control for the pore-size homogenization, could be a candidate as the optimal knitting scaffold.

This study aimed to investigate the role of EMT in metaplastic carcinoma. Methods: E-cadherin, Slug, Twist and Vimentin levels were detected by immunohistochemistry in 167 TNBC tumors, including 145 invasive carcinomas of no special type (ICONSTs), 14 spindle cell carcinomas (SpCCs) and 8 matrix-producing carcinomas (MPCs). Results: Nuclear Slug and Twist were more frequently detected in SpCC and MPC tumors than that in ICONST tumors (p<0.001). The rate of E-cadherin loss was much lower in the ICONST tumors than that in the SpCC and MPC tumors (p<0.001). Vimentin was expressed in all SpCC and MPC tumors. Furthermore, nuclear expression of Slug and Twist was positively associated with the cytoplasmic localization of Vimentin (p<0.001) and was inversely associated with membranous staining of E-cadherin (p<0.001). These trends were more apparent in the SpCC and MPC tumors than in the ICONST tumors. Follow-up data were available for 151 patients. The follow-up times ranged from 1 month to 11 years (mean: 74 m; median: 21 m). The median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 24 months (mean: 32 months) and 22 months (mean: 35 months), respectively. Tumor size, TNM stage and E-cadherin were found to be independent prognostic factors of TNBC. Conclusions: EMT may play an important role in TNBC, especially in MPC and SpCC. Further researches are needed to confirm this finding. The results of this study may facilitate the future development of targeted therapies based on alterations in the EMT and stem cell markers.

Surviving cells lead to tumor recurrence and metastasis, which remains the main cause of cancer-related mortality. Breast cancer is also highly heterogeneous, which hinders the identification of individual cells with the capacity to survive anticancer treatment. To address this, we performed extensive single-cell gene-expression profiling of the luminal-type breast cancer cell line MCF7 and its derivatives, including docetaxel-resistant cells. Upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness-related genes and downregulation of cell-cycle-related genes, which were mainly regulated by LEF1, were observed in the drug-resistant cells. Interestingly, a small number of cells in the parental population exhibited a gene-expression profile similar to that of the drug-resistant cells, indicating that the untreated parental cells already contained a rare subpopulation of stem-like cells with an inherent predisposition toward docetaxel resistance. Our data suggest that during chemotherapy, this population may be positively selected, leading to treatment failure. Significance: This study highlights the role of breast cancer intratumor heterogeneity in drug resistance at a single-cell level.

J	Manzo, G				Manzo, Giovanni			Specific and Aspecific Molecular Checkpoints as Potential Targets for Dismantling Tumor Hierarchy and Preventing Relapse and Metastasis Through Shielded Cytolytic Treatments	FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												I have recently theorized that several similarities exist between the tumor process and embryo development. Starting from an initial cancer stem cell (CSC0), similar to an embryonic stem cell (ESC), after implantation in a niche, primary self-renewing CSCs (CSC(1)s) would arise, which then generate secondary proliferating CSCs (CSC(2)s). From these epithelial CSCs, tertiary mesenchymal CSCs (CSC(3)s) would arise, which, under favorable stereotrophic conditions, by asymmetric proliferation, would generate cancer progenitor cells (CPCs) and then cancer differentiated cells (CDCs), thus giving a defined cell heterogeneity and hierarchy. CSC(1)s-CSC(2)s-CSC(3)s-CPCs-CDCs would constitute a defined "tumor growth module," able to generate new tumor modules, forming a spherical avascular mass, similar to a tumor sphere. Further growth in situ of this initial tumor would require implantation in the host and vascularization through the overexpression of some aspecific checkpoint molecules, such as CD44, ID, LIF, HSP70, and HLA-G. To expand and spread in the host tissues, this vascularized tumor would then carry on a real growth strategy based on other specific checkpoint factors, such as those contained in the extracellular vesicles (EVs), namely, microRNAs, messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and integrins. These EV components would be crucial in tumor progression because they can mediate intercellular communications in the surrounding microenvironment and systemically, dictating to recipient cells a new tumor-enslaved phenotype, thus determining pre-metastatic conditions. Moreover, by their induction properties, the EV contents could also frustrate in time the effects of cytolytic tumor therapies, where EVs released by killed CSCs might enter other cancer and non-cancer cells, thus giving chemoresistance, non-CSC/CSC transition (recurrence), and metastasis. Thus, antitumor cytotoxic treatments, "shielded" from the EV-specific checkpoints by suitable adjuvant agents, simultaneously targeting the aforesaid aspecific checkpoints should be necessary for dismantling the hierarchic tumor structure, avoiding recurrence and preventing metastasis.																	2296-634X					JUL 6	2021	9								665321	10.3389/fcell.2021.665321							WOS:000674727400001	34295890

PIK3CA mutations are commonly associated with most breast cancer subtypes. More recently PIK3CA mutations have been shown to induce tumor heterogeneity and are associated with activation of EGFR-signaling and reduced relapse free survival in basal subtype of breast cancer. Thus, understanding what determines PIK3CA induced heterogeneity and oncogenesis, is an important area of investigation. In this study, we assessed the effect of mutant PIK3CA together with mutant Ras plus mutant p53 on oncogenic behavior of two distinct stem/progenitor breast cell lines, designated as K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+. Constructs were ectopically overexpressed in K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+ stem/progenitor cells, followed by various in-vitro and in-vivo analyses. Oncogene combination m-Ras/m-p53/m-PIK3CA efficiently transformed both K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+ cell lines in-vitro, as assessed by anchorage-independent soft agar colony formation assay. Significantly, while this oncogene combination induced a complete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in K5+/K19- cell line, mostly epithelial phenotype with minor EMT component was seen in K5+/K19+ cell line. However, both K5+/K19- and K5+/K19+ transformed cells exhibited increased invasion and migration abilities. Analyses of CD44 and CD24 expression showed both cell lines had tumor-initiating CD44(+)/CD24(low) cell population, however transformed K5+/K19- cells had more proportion of these cells. Significantly, both cell types exhibited in-vivo tumorigenesis, and maintained their EMT and epithelial nature in-vivo in mice tumors. Notably, while both cell types exhibited increase in tumor-initiating cell population, differential EMT phenotype was observed in these cell lines. These results suggest that EMT is a cell type dependent phenomenon and does not dictate oncogenesis.

However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and previously unidentified interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions.

Melanoma comprises multi-subpopulations of cancer cells some of which may possess stem cell-like properties. Although useful, the sphere-formation assay to identify stem cell-like or tumor initiating cell subpopulations in melanoma has been challenged, and it is unclear if this model can predict a functional phenotype associated with aggressive tumor cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the molecular and functional phenotypes of melanoma spheroids formed in neural crest cell medium. Whether from metastatic or advanced primary tumors, spheroid cells expressed melanoma-associated markers. They displayed higher capacity to differentiate along mesenchymal lineages and enhanced expression of SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, and/or OCT4 transcription factors, but not enhanced self-renewal or tumorigenicity when compared to their adherent counterparts. Gene expression profiling attributed a neural crest cell signature to these spheroids and indicated that a migratory/invasive and immune-function modulating program could be associated with these cells. In vitro assays confirmed that spheroids display enhanced migratory/invasive capacities. In immune activation assays, spheroid cells elicited a poorer allogenic response from immune cells and inhibited mitogen-dependent T cells activation and proliferation more efficiently than their adherent counterparts. Our findings reveal a novel immune-modulator function of melanoma spheroids and suggest specific roles for spheroids in invasion and in evasion of antitumor immunity. Conclusion/Significance: The association of a more plastic, invasive and evasive, thus a more aggressive tumor phenotype with melanoma spheroids reveals a previously unrecognized aspect of tumor cells expanded as spheroid cultures. While of limited efficiency for melanoma initiating cell identification, our melanoma spheroid model predicted aggressive phenotype and suggested that aggressiveness and heterogeneity of melanoma tumors can be supported by subpopulations other than cancer stem cells. Therefore, it could be constructive to investigate melanoma aggressiveness, relevant to patients and clinical transferability.

Although these mesenchymal cells are reported to have multiple embryonic origins, the functional consequence of this heterogeneity is unknown. Objective: We sought to validate a panel of surface markers to prospectively identify cardiac fibroblasts. We elucidated the developmental origins of cardiac fibroblasts and characterized their corresponding phenotypes. We also determined proliferation rates of each developmental subset of fibroblasts after pressure overload injury. Methods and Results: We showed that Thy1(+)CD45(-)CD31(-)CD11b(-)Ter119(-) cells constitute the majority of cardiac fibroblasts. We characterized these cells using flow cytometry, epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, and transcriptional profiling (using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq). We used lineage tracing, transplantation studies, and parabiosis to show that most adult cardiac fibroblasts derive from the epicardium, a minority arises from endothelial cells, and a small fraction from Pax3-expressing cells. We did not detect generation of cardiac fibroblasts by bone marrow or circulating cells. Interestingly, proliferation rates of fibroblast subsets on injury were identical, and the relative abundance of each lineage remained the same after injury. The anatomic distribution of fibroblast lineages also remained unchanged after pressure overload. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that Tie2-derived and Tbx18-derived fibroblasts within each operation group exhibit similar gene expression profiles. Conclusions: The cellular expansion of cardiac fibroblasts after transaortic constriction surgery was not restricted to any single developmental subset. The parallel proliferation and activation of a heterogeneous population of fibroblasts on pressure overload could suggest that common signaling mechanisms stimulate their pathological response.

Genomic and functional comparison of mesenchymal stromal cells prepared using two isolation methods	CYTOTHERAPY												Background aims. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been applied to patients in cell therapy for various diseases. Recently, we introduced a novel MSC separation filter device which could yield approximately 2.5-fold more MSCs from bone marrow in a closed system compared with the conventional open density gradient centrifugation method. MSCs isolated with these two methods were phenotypically similar and met the criteria defining human MSC proposed by the International Society for Cellular Therapy. However, these criteria do not reflect the functional capacity of MSCs. It has been shown that the donor, source, isolation method, culture condition and cryopreservation of MSCs have potential to alter their therapeutic efficacy. To determine the equivalency of MSCs isolated by these two methods, we compared their genomic profiles as an index of their biologic potential and evaluated their growth promoting potential as an index of function. Methods. The gene expression profiles of human MSCs isolated from 5 healthy donors with two distinct methods were obtained from microarray analyses. The functional activity of freshly expanded/cryopreserved MSCs from these two isolation methods was evaluated using an in vitro chondrocyte proliferation assay. Results. Freshly expanded MSCs isolated by these two methods were found to exhibit similar gene expression profiles and equivalent therapeutic effects, while freshly thawed, cryopreserved MSCs lacked all measureable therapeutic activity. Conclusions. The MSC separation device generates genomically and functionally equivalent MSCs compared with the conventionally isolated MSCs, although freshly thawed, cryopreserved MSCs, isolated by either method, are devoid of activity in our bioassay.

SPARC mediates metastatic cooperation between CSC and non-CSC prostate cancer cell subpopulations	MOLECULAR CANCER												Background: Tumor cell subpopulations can either compete with each other for nutrients and physical space within the tumor niche, or co-operate for enhanced survival, or replicative or metastatic capacities. Recently, we have described co-operative interactions between two clonal subpopulations derived from the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, in which the invasiveness of a cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched subpopulation (PC-3M, or M) is enhanced by a non-CSC subpopulation (PC-3S, or S), resulting in their accelerated metastatic dissemination. Methods: M and S secretomes were compared by SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Aminoacids in Cell Culture). Invasive potential in vitro of M cells was analyzed by Transwell-Matrigel assays. M cells were co-injected with S cells in the dorsal prostate of immunodeficient mice and monitored by bioluminescence for tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. SPARC levels were determined by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR in tumors and by ELISA in plasma from patients with metastatic or non-metastatic prostate cancer. Results: Comparative secretome analysis yielded 213 proteins differentially secreted between M and S cells. Of these, the protein most abundantly secreted in S relative to M cells was SPARC. Immunodepletion of SPARC inhibited the enhanced invasiveness of M induced by S conditioned medium. Knock down of SPARC in S cells abrogated the capacity of its conditioned medium to enhance the in vitro invasiveness of M cells and compromised their potential to boost the metastatic behavior of M cells in vivo. In most primary human prostate cancer samples, SPARC was expressed in the epithelial tumoral compartment of metastatic cases. Conclusions: The matricellular protein SPARC, secreted by a prostate cancer clonal tumor cell subpopulation displaying non-CSC properties, is a critical mediator of paracrine effects exerted on a distinct tumor cell subpopulation enriched in CSC. This paracrine interaction results in an enhanced metastatic behavior of the CSC-enriched tumor subpopulation. SPARC is expressed in the neoplastic cells of primary prostate cancer samples from metastatic cases, and could thus constitute a tumor progression biomarker and a therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.

J	Orlandi, A; Bennett, M				Orlandi, Augusto; Bennett, Martin			Progenitor cell-derived smooth muscle cells in vascular disease	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY												Accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the tunica intima plays a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis following endovascular procedures. Arterial VSMCs are heterogeneous even in the normal vessel wall and display different phenotypes in physiological and pathological conditions. In the classical paradigm, vascular wall injury induces VSMC de-differentiation, proliferation and migration from the media into the intima in response to growth factors and proteolytic agents. Accordingly, VSMCs in atherosclerotic plaques and in restenosis display a de-differentiated or 'synthetic' phenotype compared to a 'contractile' phenotype in the normal media. In contrast, recent studies have identified bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived endothelial and VSMC progenitors that may contribute to intimal formation in atherosclerosis, after arterial injury and in transplant atherosclerosis. The precise frequency of these bone marrow-derived vascular precursor cells is controversial and their role is unknown. In addition, additional data support the presence of a resident progenitor cell subpopulation and its involvement in the response of the adult arterial wall to damage or ischemia. This review will examine the evidence for and the putative role of progenitor cell-derived VSMCs in arterial disease, a necessary prerequisite before deciding whether progenitor cells are therapeutic targets in vascular disease.

However, to date many limitations still hamper the wide-scale application of CTCs in CM setting, including the lack of standardized methods as well as both low levels and heterogeneity of these cells. Methods: We developed a protocol for CTC detection in CM based on immune-magnetic sorting to deplete CD45-, CD31- or CD34-positive cells, followed by dielectrophoretic DEPArray separation according to cell morphology and immunophenotype. To this end, we explored the expression of melanoma stem cell antigens (CD271, ABCB5, and RANK) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers (N-Cad, -CD44, and -MCAM/CD146) on CTCs from 17 stage IV CM patients, and investigated their BRAF mutational status by droplet digital PCR. Results: The number of CTCs isolated from CM patients ranged from 2 to 91 cells (38 +/- 6.4) with respect to healthy donors (p < 0.0002). To confirm the melanoma origin of isolated cells, we observed an 80% agreement between their BRAF(V600) mutational status and matched primary tumors. The characterization of the immune phenotype of isolated cells revealed high interindividual and intraindividual heterogeneity that was found to correlate with the clinical outcome. Conclusions: The dual-step protocol of immune-magnetic sorting and subsequent dielectrophoretic DEPArray separation, turned out to be a suitable method to isolate viable CTCs from stage IV melanoma patients and enabled quantitative and qualitative analyses on these cells, which may deserve prospective evaluation for potential use in the clinical practice.

Neither the cellular nor the molecular factors that regulate this process are fully understood, especially since this mechanism probably varies depending on the type of stress. Herein, we explored the differentiation and fate of MSCs and HSPCs in mice challenged with a hematopoietic stress or a mechanical stress applied separately or in combination. Methods: Mice were subjected to 4 days of hypobaric hypoxia (hematopoietic challenge) and/or 7 days of hindlimb suspension (stromal challenge) and then sacrificed for blood and bone collection. Using hematological measurements, colony-forming unit assays, bone histomorphometry and array-based multiplex ELISA analysis, we evaluated challenge influences on both MSC and HSPC mobilization, differentiation (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mature blood cells) and fate. Results: We found that hypoxia leads to HSPC mobilization and that an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption accounts for this mobilization. Whilst suspension is also associated with an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, it does not induce HSPC mobilization. Then, we revealed cellular interactions by combining hematopoietic and stromal challenges together in mice. We showed that the hypoxia-driven HSPC mobilization is moderated by suspension. Moreover, when applied in a hypoxic environment, suspension offsets bone imbalance. We identified stroma cell-derived factors MIP-1 alpha, HGF and SDF-1 as potent molecular key players sustaining interactions between hindlimb suspension and hypobaric hypoxia. Conclusion: Taken together, our data highlight the benefit of combining different types of stress to better understand the interplay between MSCs and HSPCs.

Cellular Barcoding Identifies Clonal Substitution as a Hallmark of Local Recurrence in a Surgical Model of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma	CELL REPORTS												Local recurrence after surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a common event associated with a dismal prognosis. Improving this outcome requires a better understanding of cancer cell populations that expand from postsurgical minimal residual disease (MRD). Therefore, we assessed clonal dynamics in a surgical model of barcoded HNSCC growing in the submental region of immunodeficient mice. Clonal substitution and massive reduction of clonal heterogeneity emerged as hallmarks of local recurrence, as the clones dominating in less heterogeneous recurrences were scarce in their matched primary tumors. These lineages were selected by their ability to persist after surgery and competitively expand from MRD. Clones enriched in recurrences exhibited both private and shared genetic features and likely originated from ancestors shared with clones dominating in primary tumors. They demonstrated high invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, eventually providing an attractive target for obtaining better local control for these tumors.

There is mounting evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in carcinogenesis and maintain cancer stemness of HCC cells. However, the expression modes, regulatory mechanisms and potential roles of stemness-related lncRNAs in HCC are still obscure. LncRNA RUNX1-IT1 is the intronic transcript 1 of the RUNX1, which is also known as chromosome 21 open-reading frame 96 (C21orF96). Although the functions of the RUNX1 have been identified in different diseases, the function and its potential mechanisms of the lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 in HCC still remains to be largely unknown. In this study, we verified that the expression of LncRNA RUNX1-IT1 was decreased in GEO data set, HCC samples and correlated with unfavourable clinicopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis. RUNX1-IT1 repressed HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion and cancer stemness and induced apoptosis in vitro. Overexpression of RUNX1-IT1 impaired the growth, metastasis and stem-like features of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistically, RUNX1-IT1 directly bound to miR-632 and acted as competing endogenous RNA to facilitate the expression of the miR-632 target gene GSK-3 beta and subsequently modulate the WNT/beta-catenin pathway in HCC cells. Furthermore, hypoxia-driven histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), as an upstream regulatory mechanism, was critical for the downregulation of RUNX1-IT1 in HCC. Thus, lncRNA RUNX1-IT1, as a regulator of hypoxia, may function as a potential therapeutic target for conquering HCC.

The host immune response is crucial in eliminating or promoting tumor growth and the reciprocal coevolution of tumor and immune cells, during disease progression and in response to therapy, shapes tumor fate by activating innate and adaptive mechanisms. The phenotypic plasticity is a common feature of epithelial and immune cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process, governed by microenvironmental stimuli, critical in tumor cell shaping, increased tumor cell heterogeneity and sternness. In this review we will outline how the dysregulation of microenvironmental signaling is crucial in determining,tumor plasticity and EMT, arguing how therapy resistance hinges on these dynamics.

Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the end point of a long and multistep process, which results from the stepwise accumulation of numerous (epi) genetic alterations, leading to dysregulation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways. Gastric cancer stem cells have emerged as fundamental players in cancer development and as contributors to gastric cancer heterogeneity. For this special issue, we will report last year's update on the gastric cancer molecular classification, and in particular address the gastric cancer groups who could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy. We will also review the latest advances on gastric cancer stem cells, their properties as gastric cancer markers and therapeutic targets, and associated signaling pathways. The understanding of the molecular basis underlying gastric cancer heterogeneity and of the role played by gastric cancer stem cells in cancer development and heterogeneity is of major significance, not only for identifying novel targets for cancer prevention and treatment, but also for clinical management and patient stratification for targeted therapies.

Radio-resistance and cancer stem cell properties can cause therapeutic resistance, cancer heterogeneity, and poor prognoses in association with GBM. Furthermore, the GBM subtype transition from proneural to the most malignant mesenchymal subtype after radiation therapy also accounts for high resistance to conventional treatments. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) by 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP), a dual inhibitor targeting MIF and DDT, downregulates stemness phenotype, intracellular signaling cascades, mesenchymal trans-differentiation, and induces apoptosis in proneural glioma stem cells (GSCs). In an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas, high MIF and DDT expression were associated with poor prognosis. GSC growth was effectively inhibited by 4-IPP in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and 4-IPP combined with radiation therapy led to significantly reduced proliferation compared with radiation therapy alone. The expression of stemness factors, such as Olig2 and SOX2, and the expression of pAKT, indicating PI3K signaling pathway activation, were decreased in association with both 4-IPP monotherapy and combination treatment. The expression of mesenchymal markers, TGM2 and NF-kappa B, and expression of pERK (indicating MAPK signaling pathway activation) increased in association with radiation therapy alone but not with 4-IPP monotherapy and combination therapy. In addition, the combination of 4-IPP and radiation therapy significantly induced apoptosis compared to the monotherapy of 4-IPP or radiation. In vivo results demonstrated a significant tumor-suppressing effect of 4-IPP when combined with radiation therapy. Collectively, our results showed that the targeted inhibition of MIF and DDT has the potential to strengthen current clinical strategies by enhancing the anticancer effects of radiation therapy.

However, the overlap between CD44(+)CD24(-/low) and ALDH1(high) CSC phenotypes in breast cancer seems to be very small, as well as their distribution among intrinsic breast cancer subtypes. Due to this discrepancy, it is imperative to improve the understanding of breast CSC marker distribution. Methods 466 invasive breast carcinomas and eight breast cancer cell lines were analysed for the expression of CD44, CD24 and ALDH1, to evaluate their distribution among the distinct molecular subtypes. Results Basal-like tumours (76.5%) contained the higher percentage of cells with the CSC phenotype CD44(+)CD24(-/low) (p<0.0001). From ALDH1-positive cases, 39.4% were also basal-like tumours (p<0.0001). The analysis of breast cancer cell lines indicated that luminal cell lines are mainly enriched in a CD44(-/low)CD24(+) cell population, basal/mesenchymal breast cancer cell lines are enriched in the CD44(+)CD24(-/low) phenotype, whereas the remaining basal/epithelial cell lines are mainly positive for both markers. ALDH1 activity was mainly found in HER-OE and basal/epithelial breast cancer cell. Conclusions CD44(+)CD24(-/low) and ALDH1(+) phenotypes seem to identify CSC with distinct levels of differentiation. It seems that the paramount method and biomarkers that identify breast CSC within the distinct molecular subtypes need to be better explored, because it is pivotal to translate the CSC concept to clinical practice. In the future, the recognition of reliable markers to distinguish the CSC pool in each molecular subtype will be decisive for the development of specific target therapies.

CD133 expression in circulating tumor cells from breast cancer patients: Potential role in resistance to chemotherapy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER												CD133 has been associated with cell properties such as self renewal, migration and vasculogenic mimicry, potentially involved in generation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We characterized CD133 expression in CTCs of 98 nometastatic breast cancer (BC) patients. CTCs were isolated by immunomagnetic techniques using magnetic beads labeled with a multicytokeratin(CK)-specific antibody (CK3-11D5) and CTCs and CD133 detection through immunocytochemical methods. CK+/CD133(+) CTCs were identified in 65% of patients at baseline and 47.8% after systemic therapy (p = 0.53). Correlation of CD133 status in CTCs with classical clinicopathological characteristics and response to therapy was performed. Her2 not amplified and low Ki-67 index were positively correlated with presence of CK+/CD133(+) CTCs. Before any treatment, CK+/CD133(+) CTCs were more frequently isolated in patients with luminal BC subtype. No statistically significant differences were found between proportion of CK+/CD133(+) CTCs and BC subtypes after systemic therapy, implying a relative enrichment of CK+/CD133(+) CTCs in triple negative and HER2-amplified tumors. While CK+/CTCs decreases after chemotherapy when analyzing the whole population, CK+/CD133(+) CTCs were enriched in post-treatment samples in nonluminal BC subtypes. These findings suggest the potential role of CD133 as a promising marker of chemoresistance in nonluminal BC patients. Further prospective studies and extensive preclinical modeling will be needed to confirm whether CD133 is a marker of resistance to chemotherapy, and its role as a target for novel anticancer therapies targeting cancer stem cells and tumor vasculature. What's new? Despite advances in breast cancer treatments, primary and acquired resistance to cancer therapies remains a challenge. Here the authors looked at the expression of CD133a glycoprotein associated with stem cell and migratory properties and vasculogenic mimicryin circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of non-metastatic patients. CD133 was widely expressed, particularly in patients with luminal tumors before they received treatment. A relative enrichment was detected in non-luminal tumor subtypes following systemic therapy, suggesting a potential role of CD133+ CTCs in chemoresistance. Characterization of CD133 in CTCs might help to develop new therapeutic approaches targeting cancer stem cells and tumor vasculature.

High-Throughput Measurements of Intra-Cellular and Secreted Cytokine from Single Spheroids Using Anchored Microfluidic Droplets	SMALL												While many single-cell approaches have been developed to measure secretions from anchorage-independent cells, these protocols cannot be applied to adherent cells, especially when these cells require to be cultured in 3D formats. Here, a platform to measure secretions from individual spheroids of human mesenchymal stem cells, cultured within microfluidic droplets is introduced. The platform allows to quantify the secretions from hundreds of individual spheroids in each device, by using a secondary droplet to bring functionalized micro-beads in proximity to each spheroid. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) is measured on and a broad distribution of secretion levels within the population of spheroids is observed. The intra-cellular level of VEGF-A on each spheroid, measured through immuno-staining, correlates well with the extra-cellular measurement, indicating that the heterogeneities observed at the spheroid level result from variations at the intra-cellular level. Further, the molecular accumulation within the droplets is modeled and it is found that physical confinement is crucial for measurements of protein secretions.

A single-cell atlas of human teeth	ISCIENCE												Teeth exert fundamental functions related to mastication and speech. Despite their great biomedical importance, an overall picture of their cellular and molecular composition is still missing. In this study, we have mapped the transcriptional landscape of the various cell populations that compose human teeth at single-cell resolution, and we analyzed in deeper detail their stem cell populations and their microenvironment. Our study identified great cellular heterogeneity in the dental pulp and the periodontium. Unexpectedly, we found that the molecular signatures of the stem cell populations were very similar, while their respective microenvironments strongly diverged. Our findings suggest that the microenvironmental specificity is a potential source for functional differences between highly similar stem cells located in the various tooth compartments and open new perspectives toward cell-based dental therapeutic approaches.

Nanoscale physicochemical properties of chain- and step-growth polymerized PEG hydrogels affect cell-material interactions	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A												Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels provide a versatile platform to develop cell instructive materials through incorporation of a variety of cell adhesive ligands and degradable chemistries. Synthesis of PEG gels can be accomplished via two mechanisms: chain and step growth polymerizations. The mechanism dramatically impacts hydrogel nanostructure, whereby chain polymerized hydrogels are highly heterogeneous and step growth networks exhibit more uniform structures. Underpinning these alterations in nanostructure of chain polymerized hydrogels are densely-packed hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(acrylate) kinetic chains between hydrophilic PEG crosslinkers. As cell-material interactions, such as those mediated by integrins, occur at the nanoscale and affect cell behavior, it is important to understand how different modes of polymerization translate into nanoscale mechanical and hydrophobic heterogeneities of hydrogels. Therefore, chain- and step-growth polymerized PEG hydrogels with macroscopically similar macromers and compliance (for example, methacrylate-functionalized PEG (PEGDM), M-W=10 kDa and norbornene-functionalized 4-arm PEG (PEGnorb), M-W=10 kDa) were used to examine potential nanoscale differences in hydrogel mechanics and hydrophobicity using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that chain-growth polymerized network yielded greater heterogeneities in both stiffness and hydrophobicity as compared to step-growth polymerized networks. These nanoscale heterogeneities impact cell-material interactions, particularly human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) adhesion and spreading, which has implications in use of these hydrogels for tissue engineering applications.

However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. Methods: Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype, including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways, using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features were assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma, and metabolismbiological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, luminal androgen receptor, and mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin-restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in the chromosome 5q and 15q regions, including genomic loss of major histocompatibility complex related genes, showed reduced cytotoxic activity as a plausible immune escape mechanism. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients.

Microfluidic single-cell transcriptional analysis rationally identifies novel surface marker profiles to enhance cell-based therapies	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Current progenitor cell therapies have only modest efficacy, which has limited their clinical adoption. This may be the result of a cellular heterogeneity that decreases the number of functional progenitors delivered to diseased tissue, and prevents correction of underlying pathologic cell population disruptions. Here, we develop a high-resolution method of identifying phenotypically distinct progenitor cell subpopulations via single-cell transcriptional analysis and advanced bioinformatics. When combined with high-throughput cell surface marker screening, this approach facilitates the rational selection of surface markers for prospective isolation of cell subpopulations with desired transcriptional profiles. We establish the usefulness of this platform in costly and highly morbid diabetic wounds by identifying a subpopulation of progenitor cells that is dysfunctional in the diabetic state, and normalizes diabetic wound healing rates following allogeneic application. We believe this work presents a logical framework for the development of targeted cell therapies that can be customized to any clinical application.

Potency Biomarker Signature Genes from Multiparametric Osteogenesis Assays: Will cGMP Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Make Bone?	PLOS ONE												In skeletal regeneration approaches using human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSC), functional evaluation before implantation has traditionally used biomarkers identified using fetal bovine serum-based osteogenic induction media and time courses of at least two weeks. However, emerging pre-clinical evidence indicates donor-dependent discrepancies between these ex vivo measurements and the ability to form bone, calling for improved tests. Therefore, we adopted a multiparametric approach aiming to generate an osteogenic potency assay with improved correlation. hBM-MSC populations from six donors, each expanded under clinical-grade (cGMP) conditions, showed heterogeneity for ex vivo growth response, mineralization and bone-forming ability in a murine xenograft assay. A subset of literature-based biomarker genes was reproducibly upregulated to a significant extent across all populations as cells responded to two different osteogenic induction media. These 12 biomarkers were also measurable in a one-week assay, befitting clinical cell expansion time frames and cGMP growth conditions. They were selected for further challenge using a combinatorial approach aimed at determining ex vivo and in vivo consistency. We identified five globally relevant osteogenic signature genes, notably TGF-beta 1 pathway interactors; ALPL, COL1A2, DCN, ELN and RUNX2. Used in agglomerative cluster analysis, they correctly grouped the bone-forming cell populations as distinct. Although donor #6 cells were correlation slope outliers, they contrastingly formed bone without showing ex vivo mineralization. Mathematical expression level normalization of the most discrepantly upregulated signature gene COL1A2, sufficed to cluster donor #6 with the bone-forming classification. Moreover, attenuating factors causing genuine COL1A2 gene down-regulation, restored ex vivo mineralization. This suggested that the signature gene had an osteogenically influential role; nonetheless no single biomarker was fully deterministic whereas all five signature genes together led to accurate cluster analysis. We show proof of principle for an osteogenic potency assay providing early characterization of primary cGMP-hBM-MSC cultures according to their donor-specific bone-forming potential.

To determine the origin of karyotyped cells, we compared the immunocytochemical features of mitotic cells in CVS long-term cultures with histological sections of their tissue of origin, i.e. chorionic villi. Immunolabelling of intermediate filaments specific for epithelial cells (cytokeratin) and mesenchymal cells (vimentin) established that mitoses yielded from CVS long-term cultures indeed stem from independently growing clones derived from both the epithelial and mesenchymal parts of the chorionic villi. Thus, mosaicism in CVS cultures may reflect true genetic heterogeneity within the biopsy. However, epithelial chorionic cells undergo in vitro metaplasia leading to co-expression of cytokeratins and vimentin. Fetal-specific immune markers (beta-HCG and SP1-glycoprotein) are not reliably expressed in CVS cell culture.

Extracellular Matrix Properties Regulate the Migratory Response of Glioblastoma Stem Cells in Three-Dimensional Culture	TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A												Diffuse infiltration across brain tissue is a hallmark of glioblastoma and the main cause of unsuccessful total resection that leads to tumor reappearance. A subpopulation termed glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) has been directly related to aggressive invasion; nonetheless, their migratory characteristics and regulation by the microenvironment are still unknown. In this study, we developed a composite matrix of hyaluronan (HA) structurally supported by a collagen-oligomer fibril network to simulate the brain tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Matrigel-coated microfibers were embedded within the matrix to create a tunable dual niche microenvironment that resembles the vascular network of the brain. This model was compared with the most commonly used in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture formats, Matrigel and collagen type-I monomer matrices, to study how the mechanical and compositional properties of the ECM alter the migration characteristics of GSC neurospheres. The migration mode, distance, velocity, and morphology of the GSCs were monitored over a 72-h period. The cells altered their migration mode depending on the matrix composition, showing migration by expansive growth in Matrigel matrices, multicellular extension along rigid interfaces (as Matrigel glass and coated microfibers), and mesenchymal single-cell migration in collagen matrices. Velocity and distance of migration within each composition varied according to matrix mechanical properties. In the dual niche system, the presence of HA reduced velocity and number of migratory cells; however, cells that came in contact with the pseudovessels exhibited collective migration by an extensive strand and reached higher velocities than cells migrating individually across the 3D matrix. Our results show that GSCs adopt varied migration mechanisms to invade multiple ECM microenvironments, and the migration characteristics exhibited are highly influenced by the matrix physical properties. Moreover, GSC neurospheres exhibit concomitant single and collective migration as a function of the microenvironment topography to reach the most productive migration strategy.				, Jenna/ABI-4302-2020	Rickus, Jenna/0000-0002-6325-330X												1937-3341	1937-335X				OCT 1	2015	21	19-20					2572	2582		10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0504							WOS:000362546100011	26161688

The curability of HNSCC with radiochemotherapy was previously found to be associated with clinical and biological parameters including tumor volume, hypoxia, epidermal growth factor receptor expression, and human papillomavirus infection status. Different signaling pathways, e.g., constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, increased DNA damage repair and intracellular defense against reactive oxygen species were identified as factors driving HNSCC progression and its resistance to therapy. c-MET was found to be hyperactivated in HNSCC and has been reported to drive tumor progression, therapy resistance, and metastatic spread. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of c-MET targeting strategies for HNSCC radiosensitization and discovered putative resistance mechanisms impeeding success of therapeutic intervention. This study highlights the importance of detailed knowledge about biological mechanisms and regulatory networks for future patient stratification and individualized treatment concepts. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET activates intracellular signaling and induces cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and migration. Within the present study, we validated the prognostic value of c-MET in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with radio(chemo)therapy using the Cancer Genome Atlas database and found an association of increased MET gene expression and protein phosphorylation with reduced disease-specific and progression-free survival. To investigate the role of c-MET-dependent radioresistance, c-MET-positive cells were purified from established HNSCC cell lines and a reduced radiosensitivity and enhanced sphere-forming potential, compared to the c-MET-depleted cell population, was found in two out of four analyzed cell lines pointing to regulatory heterogeneity. We showed that c-MET is dynamically regulated after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, no direct impact of c-MET on DNA damage repair was found. The therapeutic potential of eight c-MET targeting agents in combination with irradiation demonstrated variable response rates in six HNSCC cell lines. Amongst them, crizotinib, foretinib, and Pha665752 exhibited the strongest radiosensitizing effect. Kinase activity profiling showed an association of crizotinib resistance with compensatory PI3K/AKT and MAP kinase signaling. Overall, our results indicate that c-MET is conferring radioresistance in HNSCC through modulation of intracellular kinase signaling and stem-like features.

High fidelity visualization of cell-to-cell variation and temporal dynamics in nascent extracellular matrix formation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Extracellular matrix dynamics are key to tissue morphogenesis, homeostasis, injury, and repair. The spatiotemporal organization of this matrix has profound biological implications, but is challenging to monitor using standard techniques. Here, we address these challenges by using noncanonical amino acid tagging to fluorescently label extracellular matrix synthesized in the presence of bio-orthogonal methionine analogs. This strategy labels matrix proteins with high resolution, without compromising their distribution or mechanical function. We demonstrate that the organization and temporal dynamics of the proteinaceous matrix depend on the biophysical features of the microenvironment, including the biomaterial scaffold and the niche constructed by cells themselves. Pulse labeling experiments reveal that, in immature constructs, nascent matrix is highly fibrous and interdigitates with pre-existing matrix, while in more developed constructs, nascent matrix lacks fibrous organization and is retained in the immediate pericellular space. Inhibition of collagen crosslinking increases matrix synthesis, but compromises matrix organization. Finally, these data demonstrate marked cell-to-cell heterogeneity amongst both chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells undergoing chondrogenesis. Collectively, these results introduce fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging as a strategy to investigate spatiotemporal matrix organization, and demonstrate its ability to identify differences in phenotype, microenvironment, and matrix assembly at the single cell level.

Sox2-positive dermal papilla cells specify hair follicle type in mammalian epidermis	DEVELOPMENT												The dermal papilla comprises the specialised mesenchymal cells at the base of the hair follicle. Communication between dermal papilla cells and the overlying epithelium is essential for differentiation of the hair follicle lineages. We report that Sox2 is expressed in all dermal papillae at E16.5, but from E18.5 onwards expression is confined to a subset of dermal papillae. In postnatal skin, Sox2 is only expressed in the dermal papillae of guard/awl/auchene follicles, whereas CD133 is expressed both in guard/awl/auchene and in zigzag dermal papillae. Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, we isolated Sox2(+) (GFP(+)) CD133(+) cells and compared them with Sox2(-) (GFP(-)) CD133(+) dermal papilla cells. In addition to the 'core' dermal papilla gene signature, each subpopulation expressed distinct sets of genes. GFP(+) CD133(+) cells had upregulated Wnt, FGF and BMP pathways and expressed neural crest markers. In GFP(-) CD133(+) cells, the hedgehog, IGF, Notch and integrin pathways were prominent. In skin reconstitution assays, hair follicles failed to form when dermis was depleted of both GFP(+) CD133(+) and GFP(-) CD133(+) cells. In the absence of GFP(+) CD133(+) cells, awl/auchene hairs failed to form and only zigzag hairs were found. We have thus demonstrated a previously unrecognised heterogeneity in dermal papilla cells and shown that Sox2-positive cells specify particular hair follicle types.

Heterotypic mouse models of canine osteosarcoma recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and biological behavior	DISEASE MODELS & MECHANISMS												Osteosarcoma (OS) is a heterogeneous and rare disease with a disproportionate impact because it mainly affects children and adolescents. Lamentably, more than half of patients with OS succumb to metastatic disease. Clarification of the etiology of the disease, development of better strategies to manage progression, and methods to guide personalized treatments are among the unmet health needs for OS patients. Progress in managing the disease has been hindered by the extreme heterogeneity of OS; thus, better models that accurately recapitulate the natural heterogeneity of the disease are needed. For this study, we used cell lines derived from two spontaneous canine OS tumors with distinctly different biological behavior (OS-1 and OS-2) for heterotypic in vivo modeling that recapitulates the heterogeneous biology and behavior of this disease. Both cell lines demonstrated stability of the transcriptome when grown as orthotopic xenografts in athymic nude mice. Consistent with the behavior of the original tumors, OS-2 xenografts grew more rapidly at the primary site and had greater propensity to disseminate to lung and establish microscopic metastasis. Moreover, OS-2 promoted formation of a different tumor-associated stromal environment than OS-1 xenografts. OS-2-derived tumors comprised a larger percentage of the xenograft tumors than OS-1-derived tumors. In addition, a robust pro-inflammatory population dominated the stromal cell infiltrates in OS-2 xenografts, whereas a mesenchymal population with a gene signature reflecting myogenic signaling dominated those in the OS-1 xenografts. Our studies show that canine OS cell lines maintain intrinsic features of the tumors from which they were derived and recapitulate the heterogeneous biology and behavior of bone cancer in mouse models. This system provides a resource to understand essential interactions between tumor cells and the stromal environment that drive the progression and metastatic propensity of OS.

Exosome-mediated transfer from the tumor microenvironment increases TGF beta signaling in squamous cell carcinoma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH												Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) signaling in cancer is context dependent and acts either as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. Loss of function mutation in TGF beta type II receptor (TVRII) is a frequent event in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recently, heterogeneity of TGF beta response has been described at the leading edge of SCC and this heterogeneity has been shown to influence stem cell renewal and drug resistance. Because exosome transfer from stromal to breast cancer cells regulates therapy resistance pathways we investigated whether exosomes contain components of the TGF beta signaling pathway and whether exosome transfer between stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells can influence TGF beta signaling in SCC. We demonstrate that exosomes purified from stromal fibroblasts isolated from patients with oral SCC contains T beta RII. We also demonstrate that transfer of fibroblast exosomes increases TGF beta signaling in SCC keratinocytes devoid of T beta RII which remain non-responsive to TGF beta ligand in the absence of exosome transfer. Overall our data show that stromal communication with tumor cells can direct TGF beta signaling in SCC.

The heterogeneity in the content of the different stem and progenitor cells composing HUCB mononuclear cells (MNC) may influence their engraftment and neurotherapeutic effect. We hypothesized that CD45 pan-hematopoietic marker expression is heterogeneous in MNC, and therefore, CD45(+) subpopulation enrichment for neurotherapy may provide a tool to overcome cellular variance in different HUCB units. We employed an immunomagnetic separation method to isolate and characterize HUCB CD45(+) pan-hematopoietic subpopulation and to investigate whether the vaginal or cesarean deliveries influence their neurotherapeutic effect in a traumatic brain injury (TBI) mouse model. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were subjected to moderate TBI and intravenously xenotransplanted with 1 x 10(6) CD45(+) cells derived from either vaginal or cesarean HUCB units. A large heterogeneity in the expression of CD45 marker in MNC, both in vaginal and cesarean HUCB units, was found, regardless of the number of live births. A higher expression of hematopoietic markers was found in the CD45(+) subpopulation while low expressional levels of typical mesenchymal markers were detected. Neurotherapeutic effects, evaluated with an established neurological severity score and novel object recognition test, indicated improved functional motor and memory recovery and found independent of delivery type. Cytokine analysis in extracts of TBI brain cortices indicated an acute immunomodulatory effect by HUCB CD45(+) subpopulation upon xenotransplantation. These results may provide insights to CD45 marker as a predictor of HUCB units' quality for neurotherapy in TBI.

In this work we show that miR-127, an embryoexpressing lung miRNA, was prominently induced in lung adenocarcinoma and correlated with poor prognosis. Elevated miR-127 level drove a pronounced shift from the epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype in cancer cells, and this shift was associated with their acquisition of stem-like traits, increased resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor and tumor-propagating potential. In contrast, antagonizing miR-127 markedly reversed this malignant transition, compromised the stem-like properties and the in vivo tumorigenic capability of cancer cells. Importantly, a regulatory loop involving the inflammatory signals NF-.B, miR-127 and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 was uncovered as a self-reinforcing circuitry that ensured an aggressive transition in lung cancer. Thus, this work identifies a novel molecular mechanism linking stemness, malignancy and inflammation, opening a new avenue for cancer treatment.

J	Liu, MJ; Gomez, D				Liu, Mingjun; Gomez, Delphine			Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Diversity At the Crossroads of Lineage Tracing and Single-Cell Transcriptomics	ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY												Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) play a critical role in controlling blood pressure and blood distribution, as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessel. SMC also participate in physiological and pathological vascular remodeling due to their remarkable ability to dynamically modulate their phenotype. During the past decade, the development of in vivo fate mapping systems for unbiased identification and tracking of SMC and their progeny has led to major discoveries as well as the reevaluation of well-established concepts about the contribution of vascular SMC in major vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Lineage tracing studies revealed that SMC undergoes multiple phenotypic transitions characterized by the expression of markers of alternative cell types (eg, macrophage-like and mesenchymal-stem cell-like) and populate injured or diseased vessels by oligoclonal expansion of a limited number of medial SMC. With the development of high-throughput transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), the field is moving forward towards in-depth SMC phenotypic characterization. Herein, we review the major observations put forth by lineage and clonality tracing studies and the evidence in support for SMC phenotypic diversity in healthy and diseased vascular tissue. We will also discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges of combining lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics technologies, as well as studying the functional relevance of SMC phenotypic transitions and identifying the mechanisms controlling them.

Low Osteogenic Differentiation Potential of Placenta-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Correlates with Low Expression of the Transcription Factors Runx2 and Twist2	STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT												Recent studies indicated that mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow (bmMSC) differ in their osteogenic differentiation capacity compared to MSC from term placenta (pMSC). We extended these studies and investigated the expression of factors involved in regulation of bone metabolism in both cell types. To this end, MSC were expanded in vitro and characterized. The total transcriptome was investigated by microarrays, and for selected genes, the differences in gene expression were explored by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. We report that bmMSC and pMSC share expression of typical lineage surface markers, including CD73, CD90, CD105, and lack of CD14, CD34, and CD45. However, according to transcriptome analyses, they differ significantly in their expression of more than 590 genes. Factors involved in bone metabolism, including alkaline phosphatase (P<0.05), osteoglycin (P<0.05), osteomodulin (P<0.05), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) (P<0.04), and WISP2 (P<0.05), were expressed at significantly lower levels in pMSC, but twist-related protein 2 (Twist2) (P<0.0002) was expressed at significantly higher levels. The osteogenic differentiation capacity of pMSC was very low. The adipogenic differentiation was somewhat more prominent in bmMSC, while the chondrogenic differentiation seemed not to differ between bmMSC and pMSC, as determined by histochemical staining. However, expression and induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPAR2) and Sox9, factors involved in early adipogenesis and chondrogenesis, respectively, were higher in bmMSC. We conclude that despite many similarities between bmMSC and pMSC, when expanded under identical conditions, they vary considerably with respect to their in vitro differentiation potential. For regenerative purposes, the choice of MSC may therefore influence the outcome of a treatment considerably.

Kinetic Modeling of ABCG2 Transporter Heterogeneity: A Quantitative, Single-Cell Analysis of the Side Population Assay	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY												The side population (SP) assay, a technique used in cancer and stem cell research, assesses the activity of ABC transporters on Hoechst staining in the presence and absence of transporter inhibition, identifying SP and non-SP cell (NSP) subpopulations by differential staining intensity. The interpretation of the assay is complicated because the transporter-mediated mechanisms fail to account for cell-to-cell variability within a population or adequately control the direct role of transporter activity on staining intensity. We hypothesized that differences in dye kinetics at the single-cell level, such as ABCG2 transporter-mediated efflux and DNA binding, are responsible for the differential cell staining that demarcates SP/NSP identity. We report changes in A549 phenotype during time in culture and with TGF beta treatment that correlate with SP size. Clonal expansion of individually sorted cells re-established both SP and NSPs, indicating that SP membership is dynamic. To assess the validity of a purely kinetics-based interpretation of SP/NSP identity, we developed a computational approach that simulated cell staining within a heterogeneous cell population; this exercise allowed for the direct inference of the role of transporter activity and inhibition on cell staining. Our simulated SP assay yielded appropriate SP responses for kinetic scenarios in which high transporter activity existed in a portion of the cells and little differential staining occurred in the majority of the population. With our approach for single-cell analysis, we observed SP and NSP cells at both ends of a transporter activity continuum, demonstrating that features of transporter activity as well as DNA content are determinants of SP/NSP identity.

Here we report a rapid, large-scale single-cell resolution 3D imaging protocol based on a one-step clearing agent that allows visualization of normal tissue architecture and entire tumors at cellular resolution. Imaging of multicolor lineage-tracing models of breast cancer targeted to either basal or lumina! progenitor cells revealed profound clonal restriction during progression. Expression profiling of clones arising in Pten/Trp53-deficient tumors identified distinct molecular signatures. Strikingly, most clones harbored cells that had undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating widespread, inherent plasticity. Hence, an integrative pipeline that combines lineage tracing, 3D imaging, and clonal RNA sequencing technologies offers a comprehensive path for studying mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in whole tumors.
